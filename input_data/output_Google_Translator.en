Another crucial step for the Balkans.
Since the world is focused on Iraq, North Korea and a potential crisis with Iran over nuclear weapons, Kosovo goes a little unnoticed.
The public will soon have the opportunity to turn his attention to this province when taking a decision on his fate.
States - States and its European friends have repeatedly stated their intention to take before the end of the year the difficult decision whether to separate Kosovo from Serbia.
This decision, crucial to the future of an unstable region will test Western determination and unity.
Negotiations this year in Vienna, orchestrated by the United Nations, showed that an agreement between Serbia and Kosovo on "final status" will not see the day.
Negotiations are continuing, but, as said tactfully the UN negotiator and former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari to the Security Council, they are effectively dead.
No Serbian leader will agree to Kosovo's independence, because nationalism remains the dominant political force in the country.
Indeed, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, the apostle of Serbian nationalism, tried by all means to undermine the interim government of Kosovo.
He is rushing to hold a national referendum this month - one on a new constitution without serious parliamentary debate or the usual public education.
The main objective of this new constitution is its preamble, which enshrines Kosovo's status as an inalienable part of Serbia.
Kosovo Albanians have said they will not accept any tie to Serbia, no matter how tenuous.
Throughout the 1990s, they are virtually out of the Kosovo Serbs managed by creating parallel institutions.
Their forced mass exodus in 1999 and NATO intervention that followed, putting an end to Serbian rule and establishing a quasi - state under the aegis of the UN, made intolerable any solution other than that of independence.
Within a month or two, the Balkan Contact Group, or States - United States, United - Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Russia, will consider Ahtisaari's recommendations on the final status Kosovo and propose may - be a solution to the Security Council, which must make the final decision.
In public, all members of the Contact Group tried to leave the question of Kosovo's final status open, but privately States - the United States and some of its allies have told the two parties that they will propose independence this year.
Some members of the Security Council, including Russia and China, a dim eye or remain skeptical of an imposed solution, and few governments are for the division of the territory of another country, that are quelqu'imp√©rieuses circumstances.
The choice of the Security Council to approve independence largely depends on the ability to prevent a Russian veto, which will require considerable diplomatic effort.
The nature of the independence bestowed is also important.
The independent Kosovo must be able to live safely and minorities must be protected.
Northern Kosovo, now largely under Belgrade's control, must not be partitioned in fact while not being the name.
To reduce the blow to Serbia, it is necessary that the Security Council avoid granting so distorted that if the new state of independence can not really work.
If the Security Council fails to take a decision on final status, it will cause a CRITICAL status: Kosovo would declare independence unilaterally, and all nations will have to decide or not to recognize the new state.
If this happens, it is likely that the Serbs in northern Kosovo would declare their own independence.
At a minimum, Serbia would campaign strongly against any recognition.
In fact, the Serbian government is already trying to persuade the West to postpone a decision until mid - 2007.
He claims that if Kosovo becomes independent, the ultranationalist Radical Party hoist to power in the next elections, and believes that holding elections this year will encourage the Contact Group to postpone its proposal to the Security Council.
In addition, the government has encouraged the leaders of the Republika Srpska of Bosnia threaten to hold their own referendum on separation from a still fragile Bosnia.
And they continue to push, in vain, for the return of Ahtisaari to prolong the Vienna talks.
The timing of the constitutional referendum appears to be part of this delaying strategy.
Some hope that postponement will stimulate violence in Kosovo and further encourage Western reconsideration of independence of Kosovo.
This tactic may - be in the process of work.
Many EU countries are worried about the implications of withdrawing territory of a country, as well as the impact of Kosovo's independence on Serbian democracy.
Given the political instability in Serbia, they question the damage that would cause a short-term adjournment, which would be mostly self - inflicted.
But delay would only allow Kostunica to find new ways to make more difficult a decision of the Security Council.
The West must ignore the siren song of Belgrade.
Serbian politics will be chaotic and unstable for the foreseeable future, and Serbian politicians will attempt to use this as an excuse to avoid facing the loss of Kosovo.
Similarly, establishing links between Serbia and Kosovo under any circumstances, be problematic.
But a failure to make a final decision today on the final status of Kosovo will produce a worse situation in the Balkans, will impede the progress of Serbia towards the West and its eventual accession to the EU, condemn Kosovo ethnic minorities to dangerous ambiguity, and imperils fragile states like Bosnia and Macedonia.
The only realistic solution for Kosovo is independence.
If Serbia wants to join the West, it must not give up this opportunity to be trapped by its nationalist past.
Dangerous new dawn for South Korea.
North Korea's decision to expel UN atomic energy inspectors is one more reason to consider the election of Roh Moo Hyun as President of South Korea two weeks earlier as a tidal - de - historical tide.
The beginning of his term does not coincide only with one of the most dangerous episodes of the Korean peninsula in decades, but his presidency will also witness a tested relations between states - the United States and South Korea to a degree never achieved in the past.
Roh's victory over Lee Hoi Chang demonstrates a generational shift in Korean politics, with a youth determined to win freedom of movement in its relations with the United - States.
In fact, generational differences were the deciding factor in the race for president, replacing the regional sentiments that dominated every presidential race preceding the one - one.
According to one report, over 60% of the population of 20-30 years voted for Roh, creating a difference of 2.3% in this presidential race where found themselves for the first time in 31 years the two men face to face, fighting shoulder against shoulder.
Populist and nationalist position Roh will quickly and severely tested by reality when he takes his post in February.
But that one associates generational change that brought him to power with a strong popular will to pursue commitments vis - a - vis North Korea, beyond the fact that North Korea continues to strengthen the nuclear level, and the recipe is complete for a disagreement with the United - States.
Roh, a self-taught who passes the bar exam without going to college or to the right, was able to convince the electorate that it would open a new era in politics, better reflecting South Korea enriched and whose class average has increased and sweeping political game dominated by insiders, regional disputes and factional struggles.
His style and rhetoric put forth the new image (for Korea!) A man of the people involved in the elimination of patronage networks and sclerotic corruption.
For the first time in modern Korean history, the presidential campaign was really the place for debates on central questions that the country faces, rather than focusing on parties and personalities.
The candidate Roh called for a new relationship between South Korea and the United - States, based on the principle of independence and equality.
Thus, he announced not wanting to be in tow States - States nor want to go to Washington to just take the traditional photo. He also promised to continue the policies of President Kim Dae Jung, called "sunshine policy", in its engagement with the North.
It is remarkable that Roh had won the election in spite of the decision North - Korean reactivate its nuclear reactors arrested since 1994.
A few years ago, such a gesture would have doomed Roh's candidacy.
He surpassed this obstacle without changing position on engagement with North Korea demonstrates that times have changed dramatically.
The desire for change urgent popular rather than a comfortable situation has become now the main concern of any Korean means.
Roh's election campaign also benefited from a growing trend of anti - Americanism.
The acquittal by a US military court of two American soldiers who accidentally killed aboard their armored vehicle two Korean schoolgirls last June triggered street protests across the country.
Although President George W. Bush apologized twice for the deaths of the two little girls, requirements continued to accumulate to amend the agreement on the status of the armed forces (Status of Forces Agreement, SOFA) that governs the legal treatment of American troops stationed in South Korea.
Koreans insist that US soldiers who commit crimes should be judged by the Korean courts.
This expression of wounded national pride was possible after the extraordinary performance of the Southern Party - Korean in the World Cup last summer, which helped to convince Koreans full maturity of their country, and thus can now defend themselves without the presence of 37,000 American soldiers.
In fact, many Koreans now perceive the US presence, not the communist regime in North Korea as the biggest obstacle to unification.
According to a recent survey, only 54.8% of Koreans are still in favor of keeping US troops in their country, while 31.7% opposed.
These sentiments will form part of the test of diplomacy that will give forms to the presidency of Roh from the beginning, since it has to rethink the relationship between Korea and the United States - US even as the Bush administration is agitated about nuclear ambitions of North Korea and its role in the spread of weapons of mass destruction in rogue states.
For now, Korean voters apparently immune to threats posed by nuclear weapons in North Korea, Roh support the policy for maintaining dialogue and economic exchange with the North.
Under President Roh, the internal politics of South Korea and its relations with the United - States and North Korea will require up to nine quasi - total.
Will he keep on the tightrope of maintaining security in the peninsula while remaining committed vis - a - vis America and keeping the support of the electorate?
Reconciling these objectives would be a tough test for even the most experienced politician and the most cynical, then from there to whether President Roh can succeed is the divination.
However, while failure involves perspectives so horrible that no one can really want it.
Everyone's path to peace.
Over the next three weeks, the Israeli army will engage in an unprecedented exercise: instead of defending the country against external enemies or terrorists, it will be evacuated by force if necessary, 9,000 Israelis from their homes.
The unilateral withdrawal of Israel is the result of a profound political change caused by two somewhat contradictory convictions that have characterized the policies of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in 2003: first, that the "road map" originally launched by States - States is going nowhere, then, that the status quo is untenable.
For Sharon, there is no doubt that the 9,000 Jewish settlers living among 1.2 million Palestinians in Gaza are no future.
Therefore, the absence of negotiations, a unilateral withdrawal is the only sensible approach to reducing violence and stabilization.
This policy has deeply divided Israel. The settlers, mostly religious, but not all, are felt betrayed by Sharon, "the father of the settlements."
It is now the Israeli left that, although against - heart, realizes that the new pragmatism preached by Sharon might - be the first step in the right direction.
Like de Gaulle in Algeria, Sharon has reshuffled the cards of Israel's policy.
These past weeks have been part of massive demonstrations, some bordering on violence. Number of settlers have declared that they do not obey the evacuation orders.
The army and the police have mobilized almost 50,000 troops to carry out evictions.
This forcible approach is traumatic not only for the settlers, but also for many other Israelis.
The coming days and weeks ahead will only tell us if the evacuation happens peacefully or not.
In the meantime, Sharon has paid dearly for its policy.
Right-wing parties have left the ruling coalition, he has lost his majority in his own Likud Party, and his finance minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, left his government.
Only by inviting the Labor Party Shimon Peres in his office that Sharon has managed to retain its parliamentary majority.
The question obviously arises on the situation after the withdrawal from Gaza.
Initially, this withdrawal left many skeptical governments, but they have come to realize, as they say in Washington, that was the only thing to do.
Among them, as among Palestinians, some hope that after the Gaza withdrawal will be possible to return to the road map and to resume negotiations leading to a final agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
This is a huge mistake.
Even if it is motivated by the best of intentions, the hope of reviving the road map is not realistic.
Future negotiations will address the last borders between Israel and Palestine, the fate of 200,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, the status of Jerusalem and the Palestinian refugee problem in 1947-48.
The gulf between the Israeli and Palestinian positions on these issues has not diminished since the failed negotiations at Camp David in 2000, while fear and distrust have only grow.
Attempt to engage in negotiations in such circumstances would not only be an exercise in futility, but may merely strengthen further the distance and suspicion on both sides.
The failure of the Annan plan for Cyprus suggests that good intentions are not enough - and the disagreements in Cyprus were miniscule compared to what divides Israelis and Palestinians.
What - so it can be done?
The only rational approach is likely to acknowledge that unilateral steps on each side can further promote the cause of the decline in violence and the final reconciliation.
On the Israeli side, further withdrawals of dozens of small isolated West Bank settlements, causing the evacuation of 20,000 to 30,000 settlers, may be politically feasible and would provide the Palestinians a contiguous territory in the West Bank.
On the Palestinian side, consolidation of control by the Palestinian Authority a dozen security services and militias would be an important step forward.
The Palestinian leader, Abu Mazen, recognizes this, but the question is whether it is capable.
The Palestinian Authority could also embark on the difficult road of telling the refugees that, contrary to the assertions of 50 years of Palestinian propaganda, they do not return to Israel, but will have to settle in the West Bank and Gaza the areas that will be part of the final Palestinian state.
In an ideal world, conflicts end by dint of agreements and treaties.
But in real life, as illustrated in Cyprus, Bosnia and Kosovo, stabilization and the slow decline of violence can sometimes achieve the same end, even without formal agreement.
Lack of plausible alternative, one can only hope that this will be the case for Israelis and Palestinians.
A new world?
BERLIN: Like old horses frisky again becoming the sound of the bugle, the strategists of the Cold War, feel their adrenaline rise as missile defense returned to the headlines.
Certainly, the defense against missiles proposed by Bill Clinton (reluctantly) and George W. Bush (enthusiastically) - and supported overwhelmingly by Congress am√©ricain- not like the Star Wars dream made by Ronald Reagan there twenty years NMD (Nuclear Missile Defense), American nuclear missile defense system, is supposed to catch only a modest number of warheads and does not provide complete protection against enemy missiles.
However, the issue rekindles old debates about deterrence, mutual assured destruction and nuclear arms control, and revives the rivalry between the nuclear powers at a time when nuclear weapons have lost much of their purpose .
Oddly, even though it is not certain that the NMD lead the debate in full swing.
And even if the system works, he will have between 10 and 15 years may - be, before it is operational.
Also about heat up about something, if there is one day will be - being little impact.
Normally cautious governments are taking their marks as if the future awaiting them in the woods.
How to explain this strange behavior?
Certainly not by a blind faith in technology.
After all, the history of missile defense is full of examples of technological disappointment to his followers, they are part of the government or not.
No sane person can assume that what has never managed before, that is - to - say destroy a small number of warheads in flight, will happen over night.
Three tests that have been carried out so far, one partially missed, the other two completely is why President Clinton preferred to pass the problem to his successor.
If President Bush, as he has said, is now working for a new formula, it will take even more time to develop the architecture and devise a test program.
And we can not be sure either it will work.
Governments are worried now, not because of what is possible or not, but about real or supposed intentions of America.
Although Americans say loudly that NMD is not directed against anyone, the only purpose of the United - States is to protect their citizens against states like Iraq and North Korea, almost everyone is convinced otherwise the Russians fear that Americans will want to cement its military superiority (and Russia's inferiority) forever; Chinese are afraid that NMD is a sign of the American desire that Taiwan is independent, the Europeans fear that the plans of America create tensions with Russia and separates the United - States of Europe.
Because what is important, it is political, not technical capabilities intentions, it is now that the NMD creates problems: it pushes Russia confrontation, makes China nervous and reinforces a European sense of disunity with the United - States.
Damage begin at the starting line when the path is uncertain.
The political consequences are further strengthened by the fact that there thirty years, the United - States and the Soviet Union renounced effective defense against strategic nuclear missiles.
Normally, a US defense project still in the embryonic stage, should not cause much excitement that NMD.
But the 1972 ABM Treaty prohibits, for an unlimited period, the systems designed to protect one or the other of these two countries against such nuclear attack.
Given the way the United - States proceed with NMD, they will either have to violate the Treaty or give six months notice to terminate, that both signatories are entitled to do if they feel that it is in their vital security.
For many people, this would mean that America chooses to abandon nuclear arms control structure built during the latter part of the Cold War.
The Bush administration claims that, because the Cold War is over, the formal disappearance of the ABM Treaty does not endanger nuclear stability.
But stability is as much a political problem of perception that engineering calculations.
By limiting strategic missile defense, the old treaty provides some deterrence insurance for states with nuclear weapons.
Its disappearance would affect all other agreements on arms control.
Russia threatens to tear them all if the United - States leave the ABM Treaty.
While this threat lacks credibility (it would first be harmful to Russian interests), it is based on a certain logic.
The main question NMD is not how to prepare for a world of missile defense but how calm the current political concerns.
Some attempts were made quietly in the back - plane.
Legal experts in Washington suggest that modest preparations for the construction missile and radar sites do not violate the ABM and does not force the Treaty states - to denounce the US.
For now, the Bush Administration will await test results before making a decision.
Moscow and Washington suggest both a profound reduction in their offensive nuclear arsenal is possible.
Ensuring that states - the United States will participate in the deliberations makes them skeptical allies more lenient Europeans.
The most important measures to gain the trust, a modification of the ABM Treaty in order to allow a limited missile defense is being studied.
The "niet" prior to Russia will be - be final.
Thus the political turmoil in which are driven Russia and Europe can be calm - being.
But China?
It, it, is not part of an alliance (like Europe) or arms control treaty network with auxquel political solutions can be found (such as Russia), and this is a factor that contributes to instability in Asia and the Chinese nervousness.
Here, trust can only be built on a rapprochement between China and the United - States.
Alas, there is no indication that Washington has realized the seriousness of the problem.
The old Cold War strategists are very disappointed by it all.
Then they review the vocabulary and abbreviations of the royal era of deterrence, they discover that it is a vanished world.
Missile defense does not threaten strategic stability between states - the US and Russia, but if poorly presented, it jeopardizes the long-term political vision.
In announcing his determination to carry out a distant NMD, the United - States have created a political storm which they must now deal if we are to avoid the greatest damage.
To avoid a lost generation.
Everywhere, young unemployed drifting are a concern.
They are especially a problem in developing countries where a demographic explosion of increasingly strong, the equivalent of the baby boom in the West at the end of the Second World War.
But the aftermath of the war in most developed countries has been an unprecedented era of prosperity for the baby boomers now approaching retirement.
The future it will be as promising for the billion-plus young people aged 12 to 24 years in developing countries?
These countries should urgently combine the investment and the necessary policy measures to encourage young people to form, find work, stay healthy, have a family and practice their citizenship.
The payoff is huge if they get it right: accelerated development through the provision of a young population and lower dependency rates.
In East Asia, this "demographic dividend 'is the cause of more than a quarter of economic growth in the region.
Developing countries have already invested heavily in relation to the young.
They are now better educated and healthier than previous generations.
Over 80% of children attend primary school, against 50% in 1970, and infant mortality has declined from over 10% to 6.5% during the same period.
But governments must not only invest in children, they should also begin to address the new generation of young people.
However, in countries where the vast majority of children complete primary education, few of them attend secondary school.
Young people account for half of new cases of HIV infection.
In the Middle - East and North Africa, a quarter of young people are unemployed.
All this raises difficult questions: What - which hinders access to secondary education?
Is - that illiteracy remains high at times, even at the end of primary school, or a lack of resources?
Why is it not more young people who know how to protect themselves against AIDS?
Why do businesses in these countries complain - they often lack of qualified labor when so many students find themselves unemployed at the University of output?
An effective policy towards youth based on three types of measures: more opportunities for success for young people, more skills and the offer of a second chance.
Governments need to provide more opportunities for success to young people in improving access and quality care and education.
It is only in secondary education that students take full advantage of primary education.
Yet many young people are ill prepared for secondary school, and places are scarce.
Employers today want highly skilled workers.
In countries as diverse as Algeria, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Estonia and Zambia, qualifications and inadequate training are difficult obstacles.
If one wants to prevent young people from becoming stuck in jobs with no hope of promotion or simply do become unemployed, they must have access to better education and training that meets the needs of businesses.
Several countries are now trying to facilitate access to secondary education, particularly through conditional transfer programs' that can distribute allowances to poor families whose children attend school regularly.
These programs have increased the number of students in secondary schools in Mexico, Ecuador, Bangladesh and Cambodia.
But for these programs to work, it is necessary that students have the skills to enter the high school.
In Morocco, for example, over 80% of children complete a first cycle of education, but less than 20% reach the required level.
Measures are also needed to help young people make good decisions.
A government can not replace parents or the community, but it can encourage young people and their families to take charge.
With the right information and proper stimulation, young people will be better equipped to make decisions about their health and their future.
In Cameroon, for young people of the cities, a program on sexual health, Horizon Jeunes, allowed to increase their knowledge on the subject and change their behavior. Thus, the rate of young women reporting condom use increased from 58% to 76% in the group who completed the program.
Another example: the Dominican Republic, the enrollment rate in secondary schools increased when college students were informed of the amount of wages of those who had reached the end of their secondary education, an amount they had vastly under - estimated.
In Bangladesh, the assistance to female high school project gave financial support to girls aged 11 to 14 to continue their education and delay time of marriage.
Governments must also provide a 'second chance' to young people who have failed due to circumstances or poor choices.
The corresponding programs must be well designed, targeted and coordinated to provide adequate incentives to beneficiaries.
For example, in sub - Saharan Africa, thousands of young combatants - 100,000 in Sudan alone - hope to rebuild their lives in peace time, but they clearly need training and employment, as well as medical care and psychological support.
With political will, measures based on young people's efforts self - to increase their chances of success and skills, and providing a second chance to those who need them, these countries could make the most of their demographic advantage.
They can either seize this growth opportunity to improve their development prospects, or take the risk of a lost generation embittered by the lack of future.
Ending the European paternalism.
The Italian Presidency of the European Union has an enormous responsibility to reinvigorate the enlargement as an essential aspect of the new EU.
The best place to start would be to encourage a better attitude towards the adoption of the euro for countries joining the Union.
In fact, the paternalistic position of EU institutions towards the accession countries threatens to create a two-speed Europe will complicate the process of integration.
Acceding countries held their market share by making trade integration with the countries of the Union may further that in many member countries.
Three of them --l'Estonie, Latvia and Lituanie-- have a currency board system or a fixed exchange rate with the euro, like Bulgaria, to join the Union in 2007 .
Others have expressed their interest for several years to adopt the euro from the start, unilaterally, in some cases, even before they entered the Union - a position openly defended by the National Bank of Poland, and to a lesser degree by the National Bank of Hungary and the National Bank of the Czech Republic.
Yet despite their progress in bringing their inflation and interest rates closer to European levels, many candidate countries are concerned, with total openness to capital flows, a prerequisite for accession to the Union exposure to the risk of sudden stops of capital flows and currency crises.
They understood the lessons of Latin America and Asia in the 1990s.
The adoption of the euro would enable them easily to escape such risks and focus their efforts on creating real growth in their economies.
However, the response of the European institutions and especially the European Central Bank and the European Commission was negative: the candidate countries argue that they had heard first spend two years in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II) where the aspirants to the euro had to prove what their policies were capable.
Initially, even currency board systems were considered unacceptable, although, as is often the case in Europe, exceptions were made: countries with currency board systems could retain even after their accession to the Union.
The opposition of the ECB and the Commission for early adoption of the euro is unfounded.
What should count for the European Union is that the policies of all Member States are not harmful to the other Member States.
As noted Leszek Balcerowicz, the Governor of the National Bank of Poland, the adoption of the euro by the candidate countries certainly creates benefits for the candidate countries while, in the worst cases, entirely without effect for current members.
Indeed, the combined economic weight of all candidate countries is far too low - only 6% of the enlarged EU GDP --for exert any effect on the euro.
However, the continued opposition of the EU institutions has led most candidate countries to abandon the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãadopting the euro unilaterally or as soon as possible after their entry into the Union.
Unfortunately, the stubbornness of the ECB and the Commission now bring water to the mill of populist governments in the accession countries that rely on changes in exchange rates to escape the fiscal discipline implied by the adoption of euro.
However, such tax maneuvers probably disqualify a country wishing to quickly enter the euro area.
In fact, the accession countries that have not implemented a currency board have seen their budget deficits ignite --d√©passant 9% of GDP in Hungary in 2002 and more than 5% in Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia - while large capital movements exerted strong pressure on their currencies so they go up.
This trend exposes the real economies of the candidate countries to the risk of capital flow reversal and currency crises that early adoption of the euro would eliminate.
Ironically, countries candidates are to lecture by officials of the ECB and the Commission on the compromise between nominal convergence and real convergence.
It seems that the only requirement of Brussels is the objective of growth in the candidate countries, macroeconomic stability can wait.
Significant budget deficits support growth and inflation is clearly not a problem.
If this reasoning sounds familiar, it may - be good because it takes more or less the foundations of the unsustainable planning system by which the accession of candidate countries was interrupted in the early 1990s.
It was, of course, the adoption of economic policies on market forces in the former communist countries which led them to the doors of the European membership.
Thus, the European institutions should drop their paternalistic approach and take seriously the concerns of the central banks of the candidate countries about the risks associated with maintaining their own currency over a long period during which their economies should open fully to capital movements.
Today, the ECB and the European Commission support de facto the positions of populist governments in Eastern Europe that are already spending the funds they hope to achieve in the future on the part of the EU.
It is high time that the European institutions are addressing more seriously the challenges and opportunities of enlargement.
They could start by considering the early adoption of the euro by the applicant countries more favorably, both for countries with a currency board system for those using a floating exchange rate.
The European Blair disaster.
When French and Dutch voters rejected the proposed constitution for the European Union, everyone quickly realized that the European project was in a difficult situation.
The painful battle last week about the medium-term future of the EU budget has further confirmed the verdict.
It also sadly ended the British Presidency of the European Council, recalling that Great - Britain continues to maintain its old reputation of exception in the European Union.
The two events are intimately linked.
In France and the Netherlands - Netherlands, voters did not explain why they voted against the draft constitution.
However, many commentators believed that the vote expressed their protest against the admission felt as rushed the ten new Member States, especially in the poorest countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
In particular, it appears that voters were afraid of losing their jobs at the expense of migrants from Eastern crowds. This fear has been widely illustrated in this period by the image of cheap Polish plumber.
The irony, of course, lies in the fact that most of the fifteen old Member States have refused to new entrants country full and immediate access to the Western job markets.
Anyway, it was too late to protest since the ten countries of the East were indeed become full members of the Union.
But now the 25 member states have to face the economic consequences of this enlargement, not only on the question of the overall size of the EU budget for the next seven years, but also on the distribution of contributors and recipient countries.
The essential question is mostly how far the old member states are willing to pay to boost the economies behind the new member countries.
In fact, the battle took place on three fronts and between Great - Britain, France and the new Member States.
Traditionally, a large majority of the budget amounted to agriculture and lagging regions.
In practice, large sums of money were allocated either to big agricultural producers or to poorer member countries such as Greece and Portugal.
At both levels, the new member states expected to benefit substantially from the EU system.
Formerly, in budgetary terms, the loser of the European mechanisms was the United - Kingdom. At the time when two-thirds of EU spending returned to agriculture, the agricultural sector was low and therefore, the British benefited little from EU agricultural subsidies.
For a long time they complained of the injustice of these rules, especially at this time, the United - Kingdom was one of the poorest member countries. In 1984 the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher demanded and got a massive discount on the British net contribution to the EU budget.
Today the situation has changed in three important ways. First, the reform of European agricultural policy began and the proportion of the European agricultural budget has dropped from 60 to 40%.
Secondly, it has been many years that Great - Britain has a faster economic growth than most other Member States so that it has become one of the richest countries in the EU, even in comparison with France and Germany. Finally, the new member states are so much poorer than the poorest of the old member states that they have a moral argument weight to request a generous share of the negotiated budget, whatever it is.
The start of negotiations, there six months, coinciding with the beginning of the UK Presidency of the European Council.
Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, galvanized European politicians stating to Parliament in Brussels that he was "passionate pro - European".
That was the message that pro British - European long hoped and they were waiting in vain since Blair's election in 1997.
Of course, he never expressed such a feeling within - even the Great - Britain, over the past eight years.
Also, since the Great - Britain was one of the most fervent advocates of enlargement to Central and Eastern Europe, one might expect that during the budget negotiations, the government Blair shows proportionally generous and enthusiastic towards new entrants.
Initially, this seemed to be the tactic chosen by the British government.
But against all odds, it adopted an ethically advantageous position by offering to give up part of its budget rebate, on the sole condition that the rest of the EU (and France in particular) agrees on reforms fundamental for European agricultural policy.
It took time for the British to understand that since President Jacques Chirac was a wobbly chair and beleaguered staying at the Elysee until 2007, but hold no power, he had not the means 'endorse such a bargain.
When the British became aware of this harsh reality, they played their last card lamentable in managing negotiations. They petty and ridiculous offers, all designed primarily to safeguard British interests small and essentially at the expense of the new Member States.
What a sad conclusion to a presidency open with a bang, there six months, by the statements passionate pro - European Tony Blair!
The full text of his speech is unambiguous.
Blair is in favor of Europe, but not to that - it.
He wants to be part of a political Europe, but only if the other Member States agree to follow the model of the British economic and social reform.
The problem is that economic and social reform is simply a matter of national policy and is not part of the Union's competences. If such a reform to be held in France and Germany, the issue would be discussed only between politicians and the French and German voters.
It could be within the powers of the Union only if the EU becomes a true federation.
Can - we say Blair whether federalist, then?
Of course not!
It is mostly a thoughtless nationalist who lives in fear of underhanded tabloid press in his country.
So why has so fervently declared his pro - European?
Can - being has t - eventually he not thought about.
Europe the challenge of neoliberalism.
For over twenty years I have argued that the high unemployment rates in Western Europe could not continue.
In the late 1970s, monetarists bet that only a transitory and modest increase in unemployment could rein in rampant inflation - and open - the industrial west, and that in retrospect the cost of returning to the effective price stability would have been worth it.
Great - Britain and the United States - the United States, this monetarist bet turned out well.
Not in Western Europe.
Over the past 25 years in Europe, unemployment rose as monetary policy was tightened and interest rates were raised to fight inflation.
But after inflation succumbed, unemployment did not fall, or hardly.
If the unemployment rate has still not reached the levels of the Great Depression, it remained high enough to make long-term unemployment, or the fear of long-term unemployment, a shocking experience.
The governments of the companies in which the official unemployment rate remains at 10% or more for generations have poor economic management.
Therefore, it seemed to me for 20 years under the balance - underlying politics in Western Europe - collective bargaining and ample social insurance, on one hand, and tight monetary policies, on the other, was sentenced to crack.
European policymakers seem paralyzed by a double fear.
Central bankers in Europe fear that their political masters will order them to loosen monetary policy, that the structural reforms needed to free up aggregate supply will not be forthcoming, and that results in a return to the inflation of the 1970.
In short, they fear that all of the sacrifices made for price stability will have been in vain.
Politicians in Western Europe, for their part, fear the opposite effect.
They are concerned with the idea that even after undertaking structural reforms to reduce the attractiveness of insurance - unemployment and motivate workers to move to jobs and businesses to the workers, central bankers will continue to insist to tighten purse strings.
In short, they fear that without increasing production or employment, the net effect will simply be an increase in poverty.
Of course, these fears are accompanied by the hope that structural reforms and monetary expansion work in harmony, causing a rise in employment and production without causing significant increase in inflation.
But the reality is that steps toward looser monetary policies have been put in place, especially with the fledgling European Central Bank anxious to establish its credibility in the fight against inflation - and structural reform attempts are hesitant, reduced and companies without enthusiasm.
I misled for 20 years: Western European regimes have remained stable despite the exclusion of a large proportion of citizens from meaningful participation in economic life.
The growth of the economies of Western Europe countries has continued, despite the heavy burden of 10% unemployment, but not as fast as it could.
Today, it looks like I finally reason, if not to panic, at least worry.
The French rejected the European Constitution, above all (at least by appearances), because a greater European integration is concerned - it would result in its wake the huge costs and disruptions of neo-liberalism.
It is one thing to back the "European project" when it comes to link Germany and France so closely that no one think it worthwhile to war over what language is spoken in Alsace - Lorraine.
It is another when the European project means that French workers face competition from Polish plumbers, Romanian farmers, and Turkish sellers.
In Germany, the electorate seems poised to eject Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, for his tepid allegiance to the neo-liberal project dislikes.
The problem is that they may find themselves four years of rule by Angela Merkel, chancellor almost as attached to the neoliberal project as me.
I think that Germany would be better off in ten years, more neo-liberal policies.
But this does not seem to correspond to the desire of the German electorate, which makes absolutely unpredictable aspect of German policy in four years.
It takes also the discontent of northern Europe towards central banks, especially the ECB and the euro.
Not that the end of the European Monetary Union was decided, but it's just that some have begun to consider a dark future where the end of EMU might be placed in the program.
Which is enough to shake asset prices worldwide.
The successes of Western Europe since the Second World War are among the most impressive and most encouraging successes in the history of the world.
Everyone should want a united Europe today build on these accomplishments, rather than seeing generations of high unemployment to jeopardize them.
For this, the attitude of the ECB will have to change.
Europe needs a monetary policy whereas the drop in the unemployment rate in Northern Europe is more important than the stability of the continent's price.
The south and east of Europe will experience inflation is inevitable, because as regions develop and industrialize, the terms of trade improve, and under the aegis of a monetary union regional inflation may be a step.
The ECB should not try to balance inflation in the south and east with deflation in the north to artificial targets across the entire continent.
Saved by taxes.
What are - we owe to our great - great - small rear - children?
What steps must - take today to reduce the risks to our descendants and our planet from the increasing likelihood of global warming and climate change?
Almost everyone - except Exxon Mobil, the Vice - President Dick Cheney, and their paid servants and deluded acolytes - understands that when humans burn hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide s' escapes into the atmosphere, where it acts like a giant blanket, absorbing infrared radiation emitted by - below, leading to a warming of the planet.
Likewise, almost everyone understands that global warming could be more serious or less serious than existing models suggest, this uncertainty is not an excuse to do nothing.
In fact, it should rather encourage us to better protect us if we knew that this warming will be exactly according to the projections.
Finally, almost everyone agrees that governments, non-profit institutions - profit and oil companies should spend much more money to research on energy technology without carbon dioxide emissions, or able to remove pollutants the atmosphere and oceans and so cool the planet by sending more solar radiation.
It is obvious that it is the rich countries should carry the burden of solving the problem of climate change over the next generations.
After all, they were able to access the industrialization and wealth emissions-intensive.
Today, China, India and other developing countries do not have this flexibility and it would be unfair to penalize them.
It is now time to build, not disrupt or impede, the international institutions that will manage our response to climate change in the coming years.
But should - we do something else now and over the next decade?
Economists like to think in terms of cost.
And when they see behavior that has destructive side effects, we like to tax it.
Taxation forces individuals to feel their damage where it hurts - in the door - currency.
Imposing a tax on those who drive 4x4 in the city, for example, is a way to encourage collective intelligence to decide when bad side effects are a good reason to change its behavior.
But it must be the right tax.
A 4x4 which travels 17 km in the city and that consumes 3.7 liters of gasoline pumps about three kilograms of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
Tax "greenhouse effect" must - be it ‚Ç¨ 0,010, ‚Ç¨ 0.38 or ‚Ç¨ 1.15 per liter?
This choice will be determined by what we learn over the years, but today the amount of the tax hinges on a philosophical question: How many believe - we have our distant descendants?
The Australian economist John Quiggin has an illuminating discussion on his website (.
On the other hand, critics of this calculation point out that the world today is poor. The average annual GDP per capita in purchasing power parity, is located at 5500 ‚Ç¨.
It is expected that the improved technology and its spread to make the world much richer in 2100 with an annual growth of 2 percent, it will reach almost ‚Ç¨ 40,000 per capita in terms of purchasing power 2006.
These critics believe so much we need today this marginal spending ‚Ç¨ 55 that richer people of 2100 will need the ‚Ç¨ 400 they would gain by being protected from the effects of climate change.
But what the critics often do not say is that the same logic applies to the world today.
The average annual income per capita is currently around ‚Ç¨ 30,600 in the United States - the US, Japan and Western Europe and less than ‚Ç¨ 4,600 for the poorer half of the globe.
The same logic that we need 55 ‚Ç¨ today that people of 2100 will need an additional 400 ‚Ç¨ is that the rich should be taxed more, to the extent that each additional ‚Ç¨ 380 in taxes in rich countries result in an increase in per capita income from 55 ‚Ç¨ in poor countries.
In other words, if the rich are stingy today toward our much richer descendants, and if we decide to let them get by with an ecological disaster, we must now be generous with the poor of this world.
Conversely, if we are stingy today toward the poor, we need to be generous with our descendants.
This is at least what we should do if our actions are based on moral principles than on of Leonid Brezhnev, "that we took, we keep it."
Take pharmacovigilance seriously.
Health hazards - nuclear reactors, guns, and contaminated foods - threaten us all, which is why governments play an active role to limit, through regulations often successful.
However, the situation is very different when it comes to the safety of prescription drugs.
In fact, for the regulator, pharmacovigilance is the poor relation of public protection.
The scope of the problem is huge.
Nothing to states - the United States, it is estimated that each year the side effects are responsible for the death of 100 000 patients.
If these figures are true, it means that deaths caused by drugs are ranked fourth or fifth leading cause of death (estimated mortality used).
In addition, the direct annual hospital costs attributable to the adverse order of billions of dollars, and all this without mentioning the suffering caused by the side effects that do not lead to hospitalization (or death).
Difficulties in determining the causes and effects must be taken into account.
It is sometimes difficult to know whether the death or hospitalization of a patient is attributable to a particular drug, the treated disease or a combination of both.
This phenomenon only highlights the need to ensure drug safety.
The fact that all drugs, in addition to profits, produce side effects in some patients is one of the reasons for pharmacovigilance.
It is necessary to carefully weigh the benefits and adverse effects of drugs before approving them and use them.
These judgments vary, depending on whether they are issued by a pharmaceutical company, which expects profits in sales, or a patient may suffer serious side effects.
Incomplete knowledge complicates this assessment.
The rush to get new drugs to market often leads to inadequate safety documentation.
More than half of approved drugs causes serious side effects unknown at the time of its authorization to market.
An example: when the new analgesic class called Cox - 2 inhibitors has been put on the market, regulators, physicians and patients were unaware that these drugs could cause heart attacks and strokes.
Tens of thousands of innocent patients, may - be more, have suffered these side effects before retiring the first two drugs of this class.
It is difficult to provide a complete and correct list of the harmful effects of drugs.
The rate of spontaneous reports of regulatory agencies is low, about 1%, and the controls are passive in many countries.
We must also rely on the general reluctance to report adverse drug reactions.
Physicians may feel guilty and fear the trial, and pharmaceutical companies are concerned about threats to their profits. Regulations for their agencies must face the question "why this medicine has been authorized?".
It is especially difficult to attribute an adverse reaction to a medication when the symptom is common in the age group of the user or treated.
As the risk of heart attack is important in the elderly, many of which suffer from pain associated with arthritis requiring analgesics, it took six years to link Cox - 2 inhibitors and a multiplication by two or three risk of heart attacks.
A recent Harris Survey in the States - United concludes that 60% of adults are either not confident at all or not very confident that drug makers disclose about their information on the adverse effects of their products.
This skepticism is justified: internal documents obtained in recent lawsuits reveal that drug companies often fail to submit critical information in terms of safety regulatory agencies, as required by law, and fail to communicate such information to physicians and patients.
One problem is that the consequences of this neglect of the harmful effects of drugs are non-existent or minimal.
It's time to be serious.
¬∑ Citizens and government must make drug safety a priority and commit the necessary resources to address the problem.
¬∑ Penalties for drug companies that fail to report and communicate safety information to their medication must be increased consistently for an effective deterrent.
¬∑ Regulatory agencies must have the means to enforce the laws that stricter rules are implemented.
¬∑ The problem of pharmacovigilance should be considered a failure of the system.
It's not fair to blame the serious side effects to doctors, especially in the absence of comprehensive information on drug safety.
The total physician collaboration is essential to address the problem, but that means putting an end to their fear of being in court.
This approach works well in the airline industry: pilots who report the mistakes they almost made are not penalized.
¬∑ Patients should be better informed about the risks of drugs they are prescribed prescription and more involved in their detection and reporting.
The instructions printed in small letters are useless.
¬∑ Monitoring of adverse effects should be more proactive.
This requires more funding, which should come from the main beneficiaries of the sale of drugs: the pharmaceutical industry, as well as aviation safety oversight is funded by the airlines.
Over - all, improving pharmacovigilance depend if we want the efforts succeed, the establishment of an independent office to promote, coordinate and provide guidance to the regulatory program.
This office exists in the United - Kingdom.
Other governments should follow this model in order to fulfill their role, neglected so far, public health guard.
The virtual enemy.
Five years have passed since the terrorist attacks of September 2001 on New York and Washington, and yet it seems that policymakers have learned little about the modus operandi of terrorist cells and their weaknesses.
The Bush administration still uses the phrase "war against terror" and behaves as if it really was a usual type of war in which a government fights another.
However, after five years of military exertions, strategies based on targeting a united aggressor have only made the situation worse.
It is time to understand the new model of conflict emerging.
For the "war" paradigm fit, the Bush administration alludes to al - Qaeda as a centrally directed enemy.
In reality, there is no master planner or funder of terrorist activities.
The attacks in Madrid, Bali and London, as well as several thwarted States - States and Great - Britain, were all characterized by their dispersed organization.
These plots generated independently who have used ad hoc resources, often within the target country.
These small operations also lacked a common internal design.
Terrorist motivations differ from cell to cell, even from person to person.
Individuals can be motivated by profit or lust for power, or for political and religious reasons, while others participate for hate or for the thrill.
In addition, there are large differences in terms of risks, rewards, and imperatives as one climbs the organizational chain, or changing from one cell to another.
Conventional military models are geared to decapitate something that, in this case, has no head.
The characteristics of this new structure have already been studied in a very different context.
Terrorism is a violent version of an "agile virtual enterprise."
A virtual enterprise is any small group that assembles all alone just large enough organization to implement a collective intention.
Virtual enterprises are unusually innovative, and the business sector, they are possibly the only system that can build a unique product.
The industry of film production is an obvious example.
In fact, this is probably the commercial model of the future.
The benefits of virtual enterprises stem from their lightness over stability.
At present, most of the price of any product supports the huge, inefficient organization that assembled it.
Nearly all the creativity and problem solving are happening in small business and are "integrated" later by the big companies, whose infrastructure is expensive and fragile, and which retains most of the profits.
This model is the basis of business today, as centralization has also been the favored defense strategy.
When you buy a car from General Motors, 80 cents of every dollar goes to GM, which mostly only manages itself.
Small suppliers actually provide you 80% of the value and innovation but only receive 20% of the reward.
Ironically, extensive research into alternative models was funded by the US Department of Defense, which, as the largest buyer of complex machinery of the world, wanted better quality goods, cheaper and more tailored.
The research noted the conditions and triggers needed to facilitate the self-assembly of small opportunistic groups and enable them to act like large companies.
Unfortunately, the research program was canceled before its findings could not be applied to the business world, certainly because it threatened large companies.
We often forget that the US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld emerged from a comfortable retirement to reorganize the American military into a smaller, more agile force, using some of the same ideas.
But the organization of the Iraq invasion, in which Rumsfeld advocated the use of fewer troops than advised, suggests a poor understanding of distributed systems.
While the troops were deployed for the purpose of entry and a flexible withdrawal, the Bush administration ended up using them for an old-fashioned occupation.
Terrorists have shown a greater ability to capitalize on models of distributed operation.
Of texts are appearing in the Muslim world on jihadi strategic studies.
The best known in the West is The Management of Savagery [brutality management], but only because it was translated and made public.
These books (and the trends they indicate) are becoming less dogmatic and increasingly sophisticated in the adoption of modern management techniques.
Their research surely includes the young science of virtual enterprise management: how to nurture and support cells self - organized.
The first lesson for Western policymakers may - be that virtual enterprises run on a culture of trust.
Some kinds of trust can be based on an artificial notion of "not us" rather than on real values ‚Äã‚Äãand direct experience.
It is for this reason that the actions of the Bush administration only reinforce the dynamics of virtual terrorist enterprise.
Bush's rhetoric "us and them" clearly defines an "other" and positions it as a cohesive enemy.
His approach "war" helps Islamist terrorists to view the West as an equally united and malevolent force.
In the future, the virtual enterprise model will shape how business will be conducted, wars will be fought and probably how government services will be administered.
It promises to decouple the management of finance from that of production, involving innovation and economic growth faster.
However, if Western governments do not develop a deep understanding of how these structures operate, they stand no chance of combating the agile terrorist enterprise.
L'Expansion as a solidarity.
Nowadays, it is often said that the sense of solidarity of the European Union was endangered, if not totally blew it completely, by enlargement to the countries of Eastern and Central Europe East.
Bulgaria and Romania approaching turn of entry into the EU, and negotiations should be opened with Turkey and Croatia, it has become essential to question this idea.
The values ‚Äã‚Äãand interests of new members of the European Union often coincide with those of the first 15 members.
It is true, of course, that enlargement has fundamentally changed the Union and given rise to new problems and policy issues.
However, the new member states of Central and Eastern Europe are deeply embedded in the economic, social and cultural development of our continent.
The ties that bind us have been eroded by forty years of Soviet domination, but this did not fundamentally change the European character of those States.
My country, Poland, has always had deep cultural ties to other European countries, particularly France.
We participated in all major European developments in music, literature and film (with, for example, the films of Andrzej Wajda of Solidarnosc era, such as "Danton," a co - French production).
In sport, too, the Eastern Europeans are integrated for a long time to the rest of Europe.
Indeed, before the First World War, the German football national team consisted entirely of players with Polish names.
But above all, there is a deep sense among Poles, Hungarians and Czechs, and others, who feel all Europeans.
What is the true meaning of the word "solidarity" as defined in the dictionary Le Petit Robert "relationship between people with awareness of a community of interest."
Solidarity as a sense of unity resulting from common interests are also clearly within the 15 original members as members of today's enlarged Union.
Exceptions prove the rule.
The lack of unity within the European Union over Iraq should not overshadow the agreements that Member States have concluded all other important issues in international affairs.
In economic matters, disagreements on a single regulation in the European Union, for example, should not obscure the fact that no member state, new or historical, has not contested the Community market.
Finally, the enlargement process itself - the same is clearly a social symbol European unity, civil and cultural.
The fact that it provoked debate and discussion does not contradict the conviction shared by old and new Member States, they have an obligation to rebuild the continent after forty years of division.
Still some issues that, if not fundamentally divisive, are worrying.
Have - we fear the fact that Europe today is no longer a purely Jewish continent - Christian and white?
Citizens of the European Union whose origins are in other continents and whose religion is Hindu, Islamic, Sikh or Buddhist will - they identify with the values ‚Äã‚Äãand culture "European"?
Will - they able to feel European, as has always been the Poles or the Czechs?
These issues are especially valuable, in fact they can not be avoided in the case of a possible accession of Turkey to the European Union.
European integration is - it animated by respect for the values ‚Äã‚Äãof others?
Is - there to share or contribute to?
These are difficult questions.
They are particularly difficult if we consider culture as the cement of the future of Europe.
All European countries probably believed at the outset that non-European newcomers would be assimilated in the same way that Polish immigrants were assimilated in the German Ruhr nineteenth - century.
The fact that this did not happen either, at least on a large scale does not mean it can not happen.
One has only to see the number of respectable citizens of Turkish origin living in Germany.
Or the large number of Indian and British second-generation Pakistani that we now see in suit and tie with laptop in hand, always between two planes.
Europeans must, however, admit that these individuals represent a minority.
Number of European immigrant groups are self - rejected by their communities because of the possible social and economic integration.
The constant threat of terrorism has made the isolation of Islamic populations even more dramatic Europe.
The EU can not simply declare "solidarity" as a core value and do nothing to promote it among those who feel marginalized.
They should be allowed, too, feel that "relationship between people with awareness of a community of interest."
European solidarity can only survive this neglect and will not survive.
After Kyoto.
The Kyoto Treaty is now in force for the 126 nations that have signed to date.
It is now time to start to question the following: how to bring all nations, including large emitters, to discuss the actions to be taken after the expiry of the Treaty in 2012?
This is exactly what the European Commission recently unveiling its first strategy for a post - Kyoto, which will be considered by the European Council in March.
While the Kyoto Protocol represents only a modest reduction of carbon emissions in industrialized countries (5.2% between 2008 and 2012 compared to 1990 levels, with varying objectives in different countries), real progress can be made supporting the development efforts and preserving our planet.
But first, all countries must integrate climate concerns in planning policies and improve their governance in key sectors such as energy, infrastructure and transport.
In other words, we must act in the awareness that climate change and its effects on people in rich and poor countries remains a threat to global security.
Ultimately, the long-term approach will likely include a system based on rules, a system of incentives and investments in technological change.
The adaptation at the national level will be increasingly recognized as a major issue that will require appropriate funding.
The treatment of the effects of climate change and treatment of emission reductions should not exclude the other, but complementary.
See the post world - Kyoto offers us the chance to start a new dialogue and to consider new options on climate change.
Nations could set a more ambitious goal would be to limit the change in the long term in the temperature of the Earth, and then assign emissions rights among countries in such a way as to limit and ultimately the temperature increases an acceptable level.
This would require increasing investments in research and development on energy technologies to develop both new and better, a process that must be supported by stronger partnerships between the public and the private.
So far, with only 15% of the world population, rich countries account for over 75% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and thus most of the damage caused to the environment.
However, it is developing countries (and the poor countries of the world) who are most vulnerable.
It is unrealistic to ask poor countries, where more than 1.6 billion people have no access to energy and clean technologies, to bear the costs associated with technological change as expected.
In collaboration with its partners, the World Bank is supporting financial strategies to assist developing countries to address the costs due to climate change.
To date, more than $ 1 billion invested in projects GEF (Global Environment Facility - Global Environment Facility) and about $ 8 billion placed in co-financing, have been committed to programs related to climate change.
While the regulatory mechanisms of Kyoto and negotiable European emissions system (European Trading Scheme) have contributed to the creation of an emerging market for carbon trading, interested parties are now worried about the immediate future.
Without regulatory framework after 2012, the new opportunities for project-based transactions primer will be completed by 2006/2007.
Given the long lead time between project preparation and the first benefits of emissions reductions, project developers have only a few years ahead of them to act before carbon payments continue to make a significant contribution to the financing of projects in the current context.
The development of infrastructure-related projects is a long process that requires between 3 and 7 years, identification through licensing, financing and construction, to the first certification of emission reductions atoms.
Projects must be operational at the latest by 2007.
The World Bank has been instrumental in advancing carbon finance as a viable development tool and facilitate private sector participation in the market.
The Bank is focused on representing the interests of its borrowing countries, helping them to develop assets for carbon trading according to their own priorities.
But without government commitment to limit emissions of greenhouse gases - beyond 2012, the carbon market will remain uncertain and the private sector (essential for the success of the market) should not extend its participation in a meaningful and sustainable way .
According to a recent study supported by the World Bank on companies interested in carbon finance, only one in five respondents said they were interested in emissions reductions after 2012.
The opportunity now presents to look to the future and to mobilize the global community (all countries without exception, although with different responsibilities) in the quest for a safer world, a world that would avoid risks terrible environmental degradation and social conflict implied by inaction.
State of the art or state art?
September is traditionally the month when orchestras and opera companies are leaving the festivals of Aix, Salzburg, Tanglewood and many others to go home.
This cash is also marked (on both sides of the Atlantic) by the return of worries about how funding classical music.
American symphonic life is Euro-centric in almost every aspect, except for its funding.
While Americans rely on private donations deductible taxes and revenue for classical music, Europeans prefer direct government support.
Ironically, while arts advocates States - States have long called for the adoption of the "European model", which has produced a rich and varied artistic life, Europe is forced to change course and steer its support system toward greater dependence - √† - vis private money and revenue.
Unfortunately the European direct government funding system is a victim of the slow European economic growth and budget deficits.
The problem mainly arises for countries that have adopted the euro, since public spending in the arts will be limited for a while by the obligation to keep the deficit below 3% of GDP.
The resulting pressure on Europe's performing arts institutions is causing concern at many levels.
Traditionally, European social democracies prefer to allocate scarce goods and services like concerts and operas in a system queues (financed by huge subsidies to keep prices low) rather than by the will of each to pay.
That will change now.
Advocates for the Arts in Europe show beckon States - States where, among others, even great conductors must actively participate in fundraising and play an active role in the local community in the name of the orchestra .
They fear that the same thing will happen in Europe.
Some conductors, refusing to handle the bowl together with the wand, refused important positions States - United for that reason, saying it would upset their art ..
It is said that Daniel Barenboim has left the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in part because he objected to the fundraising demands expected of him.
But the northern experience - American shows that having recourse to big names in the field of art, such as conductors, to participate in the fundraising is not necessarily detrimental to the artistic aspect of the trade.
Michael Tilson Thomas in San Francisco, for example, has combined effective fundraising and artistic leadership to propel the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra at the top of the North - American.
Europeans concerned about the idea that greater dependence - √† - vis private money necessarily means conservative programming should also be reassured by seeing that the San Francisco Symphony has one of the most daring directories States - States.
If the audience has progressive tastes, private money and innovative programming are entirely compatible.
The corollary is that public money makes possible an adventurous programming while the public taste tends to be conservative.
This is one of the reasons why artists in Europe like public money; it releases an exclusive diet of Beethoven and Mozart.
In addition, the public can come to enjoy an adventurous repertoire force that proposed it.
Naturally, if public funds are reduced for the performing arts, not just those - will have to - they depend more on private money, but ticket prices will increase.
Some deplore it, and prefer queuing system to get tickets because they fear that higher prices will compromise future audiences by excluding young people.
But low prices for the performing arts do not solve the thorny problem of youth access.
First, young people can not take advantage of inexpensive places simply because whatever the prices, classical music does not interest them.
Then, even if they want to go, they may not be able to get seats, which are often not available because subscriptions stay in the same hands year after year.
What is the advantage of having low prices, which serve mainly to subsidize the same subscription holders, if there are no seats?
If the taste for classical music is to be subsidized, we must encourage more targeted grants rather than low prices.
The best way to bring youth to the performing arts is through education.
Because American orchestras can not count on schools or government to provide basic music education necessary to ensure a steady audience for classical music, some orchestras are the self - with private money.
In San Francisco, for example, the Symphony runs a project called Keeping Score financed with private funds in the amount of $ 23 million, which includes a national television series, radio shows, interactive music learning and programs school musical.
This type of innovative program applies to both European and American orchestras.
The problem of youth and access to the performing arts exists on both sides of the Atlantic.
Just as the poor quality of music education in public schools.
If orchestras do not look after their own future, they just may not be.
Respect for the law, the Russian.
Around the world, there is concern about the disappearance of political freedoms in Russia of Vladimir Putin.
The Russians self - are practically the only ones not to worry about this creeping authoritarianism.
They seem less concerned about political freedoms by social protection: pensions, domestic violence, children's rights, or police brutality.
In fact, most Russians are indifferent to the efforts of the government to restrict freedom of the press and the right to protest.
This apathy makes my task as a mediator, an institution by the State Duma (parliament) to protect the political rights in Russia, difficult or impossible.
The mediator acts as a bridge between the authorities and the people; it tries to resolve conflicts between the citizens of the state organs.
My office is open not only to Russian citizens, but to foreigners and stateless people who feel their political rights have been threatened.
We apply the Russian Constitution but also the principles of international law and standards of human rights, sometimes even contradict our constitution.
For example, as a mediator, I am opposed to the restriction of the Russians the right to be jurors.
Those who wanted to limit the use of juries supposedly feared for national security.
My office has worked closely with the state to ensure that most jury trials take place.
Similarly, my office defended the liberal weekly Novoye Vremya, pressured by the City of Moscow the pretext of a commercial dispute about a lease.
The dispute is not resolved, but after my intervention Moscow authorities are obliged to consider the negative public attitudes to their attempts to censor the newspaper.
Of course, Russia provides examples of problems with policies and fundamental freedoms more in the headlines as the dirty war in Chechnya or the Yukos affair.
My office handles as much as possible of Chechnya, although it is not easy from Moscow.
I could spend all my time, but Russia has 89 regions and countless human rights issues to resolve.
That is why I suggested to Putin that Chechnya is with its own regional ombudsman on site at all times.
The new Chechen authorities seem to rejoice.
As to the Yukos affair, my office can not intervene in any legal proceeding.
The lawyers of former Yukos CEO Mikhail Khodorkovsky, complained to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
If Khodorkovsky challenging the final decision of the Russian courts, he will undoubtedly appeal to that court.
It is only at this point - that I can give my opinion.
Many observers nevertheless point out that the persons who are the subject of a criminal investigation should be released on bail and not imprisoned.
For others, it is not possible in the case of Khodorkovsky: it is very rich and therefore could easily evade justice and flee abroad.
This is precisely what makes the other persons accused in the Yukos affair.
All these serious problems in the field of human rights highlight the incompleteness of Russian legal institutions.
For example, the Duma has taken far too long to adopt a law on lobbying, which in most developed democracies clearly defines acceptable and unacceptable behavior.
Khodorkovsky would be - not so much trouble if such laws exist.
Or the lack of legislation is directly related to the lack of clear ideas.
The human rights in Russia are often violated simply because people do not know they have these rights.
The most important goal of my office is that everyone learn to better defend their rights, and that the authorities take into account the complaints of ordinary Russians.
Unfortunately, most bureaucrats still despise the values ‚Äã‚Äãof human rights.
But the real problem for my office is neither ignorance nor legal gaps: the fact that in a less developed legal system such as Russia, my authority is mostly personal, and requires the support of the media .
The concepts of human rights are still rudimentary, it can at best hope that awareness will spread gradually.
My strategic goal is to raise awareness of the Ombudsman's office in order to get more respect and recognition on the part of citizens and the state.
It is practically impossible without cooperation with non-governmental organizations defending human rights in Russia.
I believe also that one of my tasks is to encourage contact between these groups and the authorities.
The government's response to these initiatives will better whether and to what extent the Putin government intends to include political and human rights in the context of his "dictatorship of law."
The conservative revolutionary pope.
There are twenty - five, the Polish people was astonished that one of them, Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Krakow, has been appointed to access the papacy.
Some are afraid, others have poured tears of joy.
Here, as a famous writer wrote, "the second baptism of Poland".
But even in our euphoria, we do not expect that the new Pope changes as not only Poland, but the entire world.
His first visit to his homeland shortly after his induction has shown the world the power of the new Pope.
Communist police disappeared from the main streets of Warsaw, the streets became models of order.
After decades of deprivation of their autonomy, the Poles suddenly regained their ability to self-determination.
In saying aloud that "there will not be a Europe without an independent Poland on the map", the Pope was able to sweep the unfair settlement of post - war that subject Poland to Soviet power.
Then, in Auschwitz, the Pope said: "I speak for those whose rights are violated and ignored in the world, I speak because I am bound, we are all bound by the truth."
Here, in this Golgotha ‚Äã‚Äãof modern times, he called the Poles who remembered their families gassed in the Auschwitz crematorium and those frozen in the Siberian concentration camps, a fraternity dedicated to the fight against hatred and revenge, even justified.
Some regard the Pope as the man who led a religious revival; others consider him a man of peace.
Some see him as a defender of the poor, others a critic of liberation theology.
For the people of Poland, Jean - Paul II, by making human rights the central point of his teaching, will forever be the man who gave us the courage and hope, who restored our historical identity.
Indeed, during the first decade of his reign, the Pope dedicated his efforts to the fight against the dictatorship, especially the communist dictatorship.
The strategy formulated by the Pope for the Catholic Church and its ability to mobilize millions of believers to his cause have meant that no one will ever repeat the question posed by Stalin, "How many divisions has the Pope?".
Jean - Paul II demonstrated that moral force was a weapon powerful enough to defeat the world's division established at Yalta.
May - be partly due to their resolutely anti position, the Catholic Church and Jean - Paul II often given the label "conservative".
This accusation suggests that the Church can not coexist easily with a pluralist democracy.
It is certain that in the fight against communism, the Polish Church has shown rather conservative, thank you God!
She has been conservative in its absolute fidelity to evangelical values, truth of the faith, to its historical identity.
For a system which advocated the official atheism and legalized lying, the Church has been a living reproach.
However, with the demise of communism, the problem faced by Jean - Paul II and his Church today is this: in what language can evangelical values ‚Äã‚Äã- they be expressed in a world in which evil is not embodied in a political system, but is present in every soul?
What is the Pope's message for the postcommunist world he helped create?
Jean - Paul II undoubtedly keeps his distance from liberal economic ideas and the liberal state, he often tax permissiveness and moral relativism.
The Pope's statements are frequently subject to a critique of individualism in the name of collective values.
He considers the flaws of liberalism as particularly pernicious in postcommunist countries.
The market economy, despite its practical achievements, often seems, in his view, lack a heart and a human face.
It considers that the market favors entrepreneurship at the expense of human solidarity.
Jean - Paul II is therefore not a passion for modern Western civilization, with its separation from the world of values, and he opposes the moral sensibility of fresh out of decades of dictatorship companies.
Just as Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the Pope tends to believe that it is above all in resistance to totalitarianism that man can become truly free and preserve the fundamental values ‚Äã‚Äãof civilization.
I confess that I consider the legacy of Communism with more skepticism.
Totalitarian pressure did create exceptional men like Jean - Paul II and Alexander Solzhenitsyn, people who believe that religious faith bought freedom from lies and loneliness.
But it also created men like Andrei Sakharov and Vaclav Havel, who defended their supreme values ‚Äã‚Äãwith reference to secular humanism and speaking on their behalf.
However, for most people, life under a totalitarian dictatorship had certainly nothing ennobling; it was more of a daily immersion in lies, spiritual depravity, and material corruption.
That is why the post-communist societies demonstrate any nobility or any disinterestedness which would cut deeply with the West.
The defeat of communism has left a black hole in the souls of communities, a hole that is now filled with ideas of nationalism, intolerance and Western consumerism.
But the first intuition of Jean - Paul II is correct: the post-communist world (East and West) experienced a spiritual crisis and the Pope wants to shake causing it to become aware of the importance of higher values.
Indeed, through his words and example he shows the Pope disrupts the world: it wants to live in wealth and comfort and the Pope reminds us that we must also live in dignity.
Label can not eventually apply to Jean - Paul II often embodies a set of opposites: rejection of compromise / Ecumenism tenacity / enthusiasm, intellectual openness / insistence on theological orthodoxy.
It is a conservative lovers of freedom and peace advocate who condemns injustice, but reminds us that mercy is more important than justice.
This is how it embodies the paradox that is Christianity: the sacred and enduring principles associated with understanding and tolerance.
Twenty - five years after the departure of Jean - Paul II to Rome, we Poles remain grateful to him for helping us to regain our freedom.
It's a good thing Jean - Paul II is among us.
A world where everything changes needs a guardian to watch over what does not change.
The interventionist syndrome.
Kosovo often plays the role of conflict - to test the concept of intervention "humanitarian".
But as Iraq spirals into chaos, diplomats and leaders everywhere are again asking themselves if it is appropriate for alliances of nations or the international community to intervene when a sovereign country appears unable or unwilling to defend its citizens against genocide, war crimes and ethnic cleansing.
Central to this debate is the so-called doctrine of the "responsibility to protect".
As a mediator appointed by the Kosovo Nations - United in the last five years I have had the unique opportunity to observe the effects of that doctrine following NATO's intervention in the former Yugoslavia in 1999.
Kosovo has become an international experiment in society building, led by Interim Administration Mission to the UN in Kosovo (UNMIK).
Experience is the right word here.
Indeed, Kosovo has turned into a test tube of international intervention.
I lived and worked long enough in Kosovo to see the outcome, and I contend that such experiments require further research.
It is clear that the need for international intervention in a crisis depends on each specific period, and rapid response is often required.
However, apart from military factors, where such intervention is being considered it is of vital importance to focus international policy discussion on the rapid deployment of a civilian presence and security related to each other.
This is even more true when human suffering is caused by communal conflict, as was the case in Kosovo.
The immediate deployment of a civilian presence and adequate safety directly after the end of the 1999 NATO bombing could have provided suitable protective mechanisms against the backlash that allowed victims to become perpetrators.
NATO peacekeeping forces were not directed to stop the abductions, disappearances, revenge killings and massive destruction of property by ethnic Albanians, which led to a vast ethnic cleansing inverted population of non - Albanian (mainly Serb).
Consequence of this neglect, noxious social and political residue pervades today's Kosovo.
Instead of cooling communal conflict, interethnic hatred remains as heated as ever.
Besides the lack of a civil and security presence to reassure every community, the general lack of legal mechanisms to deliver swift justice for crimes committed during and after the intervention created additional tension.
This tension is so pervasive, in fact, that any chance of even beginning the much-needed reconciliation process must now be pushed far into the future.
Similarly, in Kosovo the international community has devoted little time to helping former combatants contemplate their collective responsibility for atrocities, their personal involvement was direct or indirect.
Without such an effort, attempting to improve the situation is like building a house on a pile of sand.
This lack of foresight and planning for the aftermath of armed intervention is not only dangerous for the people officially "saved" is also against - productive.
Unless a humanitarian intervention is not structured to ensure basic security, antagonisms sub - underlying that inspired the intervention to the database is only strengthened, not undermined.
Six years after the NATO intervention, Kosovo seems further than ever stability and social peace.
Despite the assurances of UN authorities that Kosovo is on the path of reconciliation and true autonomy, NATO officials indicate that there are plans to maintain a long-term military presence in the province in order to "guarantee that the political process will be implemented successfully".
This brings me to another key point: a possible exit strategy is as important to the success of any future humanitarian intervention as the entry strategy.
To that international intervention is a real chance to succeed, it must at the outset to define the criteria of "success".
Only such clarity can allow for a proper end to international actors' engagement.
In Kosovo, such clarity is and failed; accordingly, NATO and the UN have no clear idea about when or how they should both retire.
Someone once rightly said that it is easy to bomb, but much harder to build; it is relatively easy to defeat a regime militarily, but it is much more difficult to build a strong and sustainable civil society in its place.
The General Assembly of Nations - UN should keep this in mind as it starts to codify the doctrine of the "responsibility to protect".
The divisions of the right in Central Europe.
In Eastern Europe it will achieve political stability?
Since 1989, the election results have continued to oscillate between the right and the left.
Vicktor Orban, the young and skillful Hungarian Prime Minister he will put an end to this situation?
With a brutal program to absorb his political rivals on his right Fidesz (Hungarian Civic Party) managed to have almost as many adherents as the Socialist Party to the left.
It also benefited from internal conflicts Socialist party have undermined one of his main political strengths: its strict discipline and professionalism inherited from communism.
Efforts by Vicktor Orban to gather under the banner of FIDESZ a divided right were partially successful and are unique in Eastern Europe.
Since the collapse of Communism, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, the parties of the center right are fragmented and lack a true political perspective.
Although these countries has not yet fully identified several decades of communist management divisions right facilitated the electoral victory of the left, sometimes played by ex - communists.
The right forces in Central Europe face problems similar to those experienced by the right parties elsewhere in Europe, where we see the social - democratic recovering liberal ideas, achieve occupy the center of their own the political spectrum.
In Central Europe, this has been amplified by the fact that the ruling parties of all persuasions have had to privatize the economy and introduced under pressure from the European Union, the reforms in the West would have been performed by the right.
In several countries in Central Europe, the left parties were best placed to achieve these reforms right, because, paradoxically, they have greater legitimacy for this.
Many people believe that the Socialists would not engage in privatization and would not address social protection if there were not absolutely necessary.
In Central Europe, the fundamental problem of the right is a lack of clear identity.
While politicians from the moderate right formally demanding traditional ideologies, liberalism or conservatism for example, the electorate, unaccustomed to Western political concepts do not always understand the meaning of these terms.
Many polls show that a significant part of the electorate in different countries of Central Europe ranks of her - even right, but decades of paternalistic communism have clearly moved to the left center of gravity of the region.
Thus, a person can simultaneously declare liberal and demand that the government continues to subsidize energy, education and housing.
Under communism, the ideology was merely a tool for power.
As at that time, even today many people formally accept ideological labels but claim it in so far as they can in a tangible benefit in the short term.
The opposite ideologies generates cynicism brutal reversals of the electorate.
The identity problem is compounded by the resurgence of nationalism. Most Central European countries in which the construction of national identity has been delayed by communism succumb to nationalist sentiments that can be manipulated by politicians.
Although some say the right, in the image of Vladimir Meciar, the former Prime Minister of Slovakia, were in fact demagogues and authoritarian populists.
The current situation of the right in the central European countries is also explained by their history and tradition.
Political developments in Czechoslovakia during the last twenty years of communism away the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Poland and Hungary.
While Poland and Hungary experienced under communism internal liberalization that allowed a portion of the activity escapes semi - officially communist control, Czechoslovakia was a strict regime neo - Stalinist after the Soviet invasion 1968.
In 1989, when the Communist regimes collapsed, the communist parties of Poland and Hungary transformed themselves into left parties, democratic and credible. They were able to effectively oppose right-wing parties that were founded.
But in Czechoslovakia, the rigid communist party could not give birth to a democratic party hard, inked left.
Faced with this vacuum, the moderate right has had a free hand and was able to maintain a certain unity until 1997.
But the absence of a strong opposition favored the decay of the line was split and lost a common language.
In Slovakia, a country where nationalist sentiments have played an important role after 1989, the political forces are not distributed currently on a straight line - left.
The main political battles occur between nationalist forces and populist one hand, anti-democratic essence, and secondly the forces fighting for democracy.
The threat of return to power led Meciar all democrats, right and left, to fall into the same camp.
Even in these circumstances, the right remains divided, allowing a possible return to power of Meciar.
In Hungary, the right was a victim of the conflict between conservative and populist one side and the Liberals primarily from the urban classes on the other.
Right-wing parties have not yet agreed whether they should align with traditional Western-inspired ideologies or a form of conservative nationalism in Hungary.
Although the current ruling coalition, consisting of conservatives and populists, has had some success, the right of the truth of time has not yet arrived.
The Polish right is the most difficult cases.
Its problems date back to the communist era, when the Solidarity trade union became the main opposition to the Communists, while unions are usually left.
Since the fall of communism, various groups close to Solidarity wanted to embody the right, sowing confusion in political discourse.
Christian - democratic parties associated with the church and the liberal parties were to some extent marginalized.
The situation is even more complex than it takes with populist and nationalist parties. They are relatively powerful because they can rely on the peasantry as an important electoral base in Poland.
As in other post-communist countries, it is essentially democratic left forces that benefited from divisions from the right.
Marre de Wal - Mart?
Like - you know what video - clip will soon be scaring policymakers around the world?
Economist Thomas Holmes, a scenario that looks uncannily like the spread of a global epidemic, has prepared a dynamic map simulation showing the spread of Wal - Mart States - States.
Starting with the epicenter in Bentonville, Arkansas, where Sam Walton opened his first store in 1962, the big - box stores [shops - boxes] giant Wal - Mart have now multiplied to the point where the average American lives now less than seven kilometers from one of these shops.
It is interesting to note that the stores spread like the petals of a flower, ever thickening and expanding.
Rather than jumping out to the coasts, since 80% of Americans live within 80 km from the Atlantic or Pacific, Wal - Mart has expanded organically through a chain of suppliers constantly expanding.
Even though each new store takes away the business from Wal - Mart stores established nearby, the efficiency of ever-improving supply helps keep the overall growth of the chain.
Love them or hate, Wal - Mart is undeniably the perfect example of the costs and benefits of modern globalization.
Consumers pay significantly less than at traditional outlets.
For example, economists estimate that the food at Wal - Mart costs 25% less than a typical large supermarket chain.
The difference in price for many other consumer goods is even larger.
Consider the following stunning fact: with a few other stores of the same style: Target, Best Buy and Home Depot, Wal - Mart accounts for about 50% of the increase in productivity vaunted America compared to Europe in the last ten years.
Fifty percent!
And the same kind of progress among the chains wholesalers account for another 25%!
The notion that Americans have gotten better at everything while other rich countries have stood still is thus wildly misleading.
The US productivity miracle and the emergence of trade style Wal - Mart are virtually synonymous.
I have nothing against big box stores.
They are a boon to low-income consumers, partly compensating for the tepid wage growth that many of them have suffered during the past two decades.
And I do not agree with some of my friends who snub the Wal - Mart and claim never to have set foot.
As a consumer, I think big - box stores.
It is also certainly true of America's trading partners; Wal - Mart alone accounts for over 10% of all US imports from China.
But I do have some reservations about the model Wal - Mart as a blueprint for global growth.
First, there is the matter of its effect on low-wage workers and smaller retailers.
Surveys show that, while remaining within the law, its social policies exploit regulatory loopholes that, for example, allow it to escape the burden of healthcare costs for many workers (Wal - Mart provides healthcare coverage less than half of its employees).
And the arrival of stores into a community crushes long-established retailers, often traumatically transforming their personality impressively.
Yes, to some extent, it is the price of progress.
But the loss of aesthetics and community is not simply calculated using statistics on income and prices.
The big - box stores are not exactly attractive, hence their name [big boxes].
If their explosive growth continues over the next 20 years, Americans consider - they ever their proliferation as a spectacular example of the failure of growth patterns regionally balanced?
Certainly, many Europeans, and others, will view the video simulation Holmes reproducing the development of Wal - Mart as a horror film.
The French can - invented the hypermarket forerunner of the big box store, but they never intended to let it grow unchecked.
The big question for Europeans is whether they can find ways to exploit some of the efficiency gains embodied by the model Wal - Mart without being overwhelmed by it.
For Americans, there is the additional question of what to do when the phenomenon of big - box stores will cool.
If a large part of the US productivity edge really amounts to letting Wal - Mart and supermarkets continue their cousins ‚Äã‚Äãcrazy expansion, that happen when this source of growth tapers off?
The US economy has many other strengths, including its superior financial system and leading position in high-tech capital goods, but the fact is that the benefit of the States - United in this sector is not the Nothing was as striking as the phenomenon Wal - Mart.
It is curious how many people seem to think that the US will grow faster than Europe and Japan over the next ten years, simply because that's what happened in the last ten years.
Wal - Mart and its ilk are a central feature of the modern era of globalization.
They are not quite the pandemic that their explosive growth pattern resembles, but their emergence is not completely benign.
Those who wish to emulate the US productivity trends must come to grips with how they feel the onset of shaped-box stores their campaign, pulling wages down and killing small retailers.
The Americans, for their part, need to think about where is the right balance between aesthetics, community, and low prices.
Accept science.
The long-term economic progress comes mainly from the invention and spread of improved technologies.
The scientific revolution was made possible by the printing press, the industrial revolution by the steam engine, and India's escape from famine, thanks to the increase in agricultural yields, the so-called " Green Revolution. "
The era of globalization we live emerged with the spread of computers and the Internet.
So when we seek solutions to some of the world's toughest problems, we can also find, at least in part, in new technologies to solve old seemingly intractable problems.
Take the example of poverty in Africa.
All possible explanations have been advanced, and usually focusing on what Africans do wrong.
But a visit to Africa's villages makes clear that the problem is more related to the struggle for survival under difficult physical conditions than with any special problems that are unique to African societies.
African farmers produce roughly one-third (or less) of food per hectare less than other world operators, which results in a large-scale famine, exacerbated by a heavy disease burden.
Malaria is a unique challenge of its kind, mainly due to the mosquito species in Africa, especially adept at transmitting the disease.
Other tropical parasitic diseases are extraordinary burdens on the continent.
Add - to the practical difficulty represented by poor roads and few cars and trucks, and economic isolation follows.
The challenges of survival are enormous.
Yet practical solutions are at hand, because simple and low-cost technologies can address specific problems.
We can overcome the low agricultural yields through improved seed varieties specially adapted for African conditions, combined with technologies for replenishing soil and managing water.
Malaria can be controlled through new nets to long life and a new generation of effective medicines.
Other tropical diseases also can be controlled, and practical technologies for safe drinking water can dramatically reduce diarrheal diseases.
Mobile phones, local wireless Internet, and more paved roads could do much to break the economic isolation of Africa's villages.
Donor countries incessantly ask Africans to change their trade policies, governmental institutions, governments, and more.
Some of these changes are important, but rich countries sometimes out of their roles, focusing on everything except how to finance and introduce practical technologies to solve practical problems.
The rich countries' mistakes would not matter if African countries had enough money to adopt the needed technologies on their own, but Africa is so poor that need financial help to get out of poverty.
Development challenges in Africa are just one example of how tough societal problems can be solved through the design and dissemination of improved technologies.
The same will be valid for the choice to be made in the best way to solve the problem of climate change caused by humans - another of those seemingly intractable global problems.
For now, rich countries are changing the world's climate by emitting billions of tons of carbon dioxide each year from the use of coal, oil and natural gas.
In the coming years, China and India will also contribute significantly to increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.
Yet no country, rich or poor, is keen to reduce its energy consumption, worried about such a move would threaten jobs, incomes and economic growth.
New technologies will provide a key part of the solution.
Already, "hybrid" automobiles, which combine gasoline and battery power, can roughly double fuel efficiency and halve emissions of carbon dioxide.
In addition, engineers have developed fishing techniques and store it safely underground carbon dioxide from the combustion of coal in power plants.
This new technology can reduce by 80% the emission of carbon dioxide during the production of electricity.
The costs are relatively modest.
Consider also the depletion of ocean-fishing.
The global demand for fish is increasing, and the global fishing capacity, threatening some species with extinction.
Improved aquaculture, in which fish are raised in ponds and reservoirs is still far from being a perfect technology, mainly for environmental reasons, yet it is very promising.
During a recent visit to Africa, a leading agronomist said that in today's world, the scientist is closer than ever before to the farmer, but farther away than ever from the legislator.
Politicians do not understand science, and rarely seek the advice of scientists and engineers in addressing major issues.
Everything is seen in terms of politics and elections, and nothing is considered as technical problems requiring technological expertise, which is why Africa's poverty is so often attributed to corruption rather than ecological challenges.
It's easy to dismiss the suggestion that technology can be the solution.
After all, technological advance also requires good governance, market forces, effective universities, and more.
Politics will also play a role.
Anyway, it's time to recognize that governments are ill-equipped to understand the sophisticated technological challenges and opportunities facing the world could benefit, and that new methods are needed to ensure that we give to science and technology necessary position to tackle a wide range of global issues taking a character more and more urgent.
It is now time that all the major international agencies and governments take the responsibility to use scientific and technological expertise that they will need in the twenty-first century.
Unblock the situation in Latin America.
One of the biggest breaks - the global economy head concerned undoubtedly the poor performance of Latin America.
Since the early 1980s, Latin America found itself blocked, with per capita incomes growing slowly (if there was income) in most of the region and with a great crisis repeatedly.
Many policies have been tried, especially trade liberalization, privatization of inefficient state enterprises, and budgetary reforms.
However, something prevents Latin America to move forward.
The lack of vigorous growth is all the more disconcerting in light of the many social benefits and successes of Latin America.
Natural resources are abundant and fertile lands abound.
Sanitary conditions are relatively acceptable and all Latin American countries have made progress against illiteracy, the majority achieving at least 90% adult literacy.
In addition, fertility rates have fallen sharply, reaching a rate at which people in many countries will likely stabilize in the coming decades.
The status of women has improved, and girls enjoy equal access to education, with higher enrollment rates than boys in many countries.
Latin America is probably known for its culture "macho", but the rate of women in the labor force continues to grow and occupy more political and social positions first.
Latin America boast other benefits over the long term.
Most of its citizens live on the coast and enjoy privileged access to international trade, and others live in cities, another advantage for growth.
Indeed, the region is not poor by international standards, but blocked in the range of average incomes among the poorest in the world and high-income countries countries in North America, Europe and 'East Asia.
Why, then, the amazing lack of real growth over the last 25 years?
I blames two unresolved problems, but soluble.
The first has existed for centuries: the social divisions which dates back to the European conquest of Native Americans in the sixteenth century.
More than in other countries, Latin America was born during a violent conquest.
Europeans subject Amerindian populations and also brought, especially in the basin of the Caribbean and Brazil, massive cargo of African slaves.
The companies became racially and ethnically complex when European populations, Native American and African practiced intermarriage, but the trend over the long term the European dominance, subjugation of indigenous and Afro - American and poverty deeply rooted have profoundly affected the Latin American societies.
Even today, income inequality in Latin America are among the largest in the world, reflecting the old patterns of ethnic and racial division.
Income inequality casts a long shadow.
The rich have long fought against taxation needed to increase investment in the sector of education and health of the poor, perpetuating deep social divisions and leaving many people without the health and skills required by global competitiveness .
Today the situation is improving in some countries, such as Brazil, which bodes well for the future.
In other countries, such as Guatemala and parts of the Andean region, social divisions remain marred by violence and mistrust.
Besides this, a basic failure of economic strategy has been largely ignored, a failure which is reflected in the major difference between public policy discussions in Latin America and Asia.
In Asia, public debate is about technology: how it can Asia catch up?
Asian governments act with determination to increase scientific and technological capacities of their economies.
In Latin America, the global technological revolution is much less discussed, and national policies to promote science and technology rarely hoist in the foreground.
Result, Latin America has not been able to take proper advantage of global technological revolutions.
Asian developing countries now produce computers, semi - conductor, pharmaceutical and software.
By contrast, even the seller Featured in Latin America, Chile, remains largely an export economy based on resources, heavily focused on copper exports and agricultural products.
These sectors are technologically sophisticated, but form a narrow base for development over the long term.
The situation is far from hopeless.
Brazil has demonstrated predisposition to be a technological export power.
He managed obviously exporting airplanes and many consumer durable goods.
Mexico has also begun to mobilize know - considerable technological know.
Argentina, Chile and other countries could become farmers peak at the cutting - edge of agro - biotechnology, for example, if they get bothered.
However, Latin American countries have not yet tried to set off a technological revolution, certainly not with the degree of importance, competence, commitment and funding shown by Asian countries.
Such a push could play a major role in the launch of economic growth.
Such a policy would involve a commitment to significantly increase spending on research and development, as have Asian countries developing.
The Latin American countries must increase spending up to 2% of GDP (currently 0.5%), partly through public support for laboratories and universities and partly by the benefits for research and development of the private sector. They should roll out the red carpet leading multinational companies, as did Asia.
They also need to focus more on scientific and technological training and encourage a higher proportion of students to receive a university education.
Government stipends for tuition and for new universities and enlarged for universities can play a big role, as investment in computers and information technology in schools and communities.
The social program and the technology program depend on one another.
Both ask Latin American companies to invest more in individuals who are involved in these programs so that Latin - American can put themselves in the forefront of progress in global productivity.
If these investments affect all Latin American countries, both rich and poor, the outlook for the region will brighten considerably.
The real estate price: a house of cards?
The first major city to experience a boom was London, around 1996.
Mentality spread to Los Angeles, New York and Sydney around 1997, to Paris in 1998, to Miami, Moscow and Shanghai in 2001 and Vancouver in 2002.
These and other cities have seen property prices ignite since then - there. Prices rose by at least 50% in constant prices since 2000.
This was the source of significant windfall profits for the owners but also source of problem for anyone preparing to purchase real estate.
Today, the increase in property prices is weakening in some of these cities.
The growth rate in London and New York slowed sharply over the past year and fell about 1% of a real increase in the second quarter of 2004.
In Sydney, home prices actually fell in the second quarter.
Is - that the end of the boom?
No other cities benefit?
Even worse, the mood in housing markets could - it lead to a price drop?
No one predicted this boom, so predicting its end is risky.
The real estate prices have shown tremendous upward momentum in the face of previous warnings that the end of the festival.
Any prediction about the end of boom requires an understanding of the reasons for changes in so many different cities.
Curiously, there is no generally accepted explanation because the ultimate causes of this boom are mainly psychological.
Economists would rather talk about interest rates or unemployment statistics, concrete factors and likely to be known.
Of course, these indicators have a legitimate role to play in explaining housing markets, but they simply do not explain the recent booms.
Three psychological causes stand all this: first, a change in public perception about the sources of value in a changing global economy and the growing confidence of the public in "glamor" cities whose name is known worldwide and finally, the plain giddy dynamics of speculative bubbles.
Each factor deserves greater attention if the current market conditions we want to understand and discern future price trends.
First, the global economy seems more chaotic than it did a decade ago.
The fall in stock prices since 2000 in most countries gives an air chilling financial assets, spurring a "flight to quality" or in this case to stone.
Moreover, terrorism is now seen as a problem for everyone, Indonesia, Spain and Russia have major tragedies.
We are reassured by investing in stone and there is little reason to expect imminent change.
Fear and soaring property prices encourage each other.
Second, public confidence in glamorous international cities has increased with the explosive growth in global communications through the Internet and mobile phones.
Just as people increasingly admire international celebrities, one perceives international business centers, recognized technology and culture-and whose names are familiar to everyone, everywhere - are uniquely valuable.
As for the fear of terrorism and lack of confidence in the stock markets, geographical celebrity appears resilient, if not self-reinforcing: the more New York, Paris and London are famous, most glamorous they become.
Finally, the speculative contagion that sub - tends any bubble can not be ignored.
The current boom has seen contagion spread within markets and across markets, rising prices fuel popular excitement-and thus the price increase it - same - in the same city, followed by other cities, to the other side of the planet.
The people of Shanghai can discuss - not in house prices in London, but the Shanghai public opinion leaders know what is going on in London, and all boom occurring in this city makes the possibility of one in Shanghai plausible boom.
In contrast to the other two psychological causes, speculative contagion has a natural end.
A speculative bubble that feeds it - even only on the reaction to the rise in prices can not continue indefinitely.
So where do we lead?
Two of the three psychological causes suggest continued rise in property prices, while the third suggests the end of the upward movement of these days, without specifying when.
I bet some so strongly attractive cities continue to see decelerating growth in home prices, and eventually decreases.
Historically, real estate prices have shown strong motion, and prices in all these cities are still increasing at a significant rate, although it is usually somewhat slower than a year ago or two.
Extrapolating trends in growth, it seems reasonable to expect that prices will continue to grow significantly in most of these cities a year or two again, even if the growth rate continues to decline.
The psychological factors are more important for the long-term forecast, the - over a year, when the upward movement no longer plays such an important role.
At this stage, prices are likely to show unstable downward because enthusiasm for investing in houses is likely to collapse along the declining price growth.
Prices in glamor cities will fall significantly in the next recession or when the local economy suffers a severe shock, or if interest rates rise too quickly.
Then, contagion within and across markets will fall, making prices fall for years.
Water for all.
This month - this, again, the water takes center stage at the Fourth World Water Forum in Mexico City.
This is an opportune moment: while the attention of much of the world is focused on the issues of energy supply and security, hundreds of millions of people in developing countries still consider the supply of fresh water as equally important, if not more.
Surveys conducted by the World Bank in developing countries show that when asked poor people to name the three most important challenges they face, their "good health" is always part of this list.
And the key element that determines whether they will have good health is access to clean water.
Today, worldwide, more than a billion people have no access.
Therefore, they are always more easily prey to ill health.
The World Bank estimates that in 2035, nearly three billion people, almost all in developing countries, could live under conditions of very serious lack of water, especially if they live in Africa, the Middle - East or South Asia.
This will cause obvious hardship, but it also impede economic growth needed for millions of people to escape poverty.
In Latin America, nearly 15% of the population, or nearly 76 million people, has no access to safe drinking water and 116 million people do not have access to any health service.
The figures are worse in Africa and parts of Asia.
This is a situation that few people face in rich countries.
Usually, the citizens of these countries benefit from public services that meet all their water needs, from drinking to irrigation and health needs.
In addition, other issues related to water, such as the risks of flooding, have been reduced to manageable levels.
Rich industrial countries have invested early and heavily in infrastructure, institutions and management of water.
The results, to - beyond the health benefits it gives to all, provided evidence of record economic growth: just look at investment in hydropower to understand the positive impact of water management projects in many countries.
Of course, rich countries have certain advantages: they benefit from generally moderate climates where rainfall is regular and generally have little risk of drought or flood.
Even so, they are not immune to water-related disasters, such as the destruction of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina has shown us.
But the impact of such events on poor countries is far more important.
Extreme rainfall variations, floods, and droughts can have social and economic effects and result in large-scale loss of human lives.
The Gulf Coast of Mexico and Central American countries are continually experience such tragedies, with poor communities the most vulnerable and least able to handle these events.
Ethiopia and Yemen are two examples just as noteworthy as the other.
The Ethiopia's development potential is closely tied to seasonal rains, so high rainfall variation, and lack of infrastructure, has undermined growth and perpetuated poverty.
A single drought can cut growth potential by 10% long term.
Yemen, meanwhile, has no perennial surface water; its citizens depend entirely on rainfall, groundwater and flooding.
To move forward, developing countries need new infrastructure and improved water management.
Any approach must be designed in relation to the specific context of each country and the needs of their respective people, but there is no fundamental constraint to water development investments that ensure that local communities and 'environment gain tangible benefits quickly.
In some countries, the establishment of new infrastructure for water usually means the creation of canals, pumping stations and dams.
Other countries may need deeper reservoirs, more modern treatment plants or improved water transport systems.
These can all potentially be designed to improve and expand water supplies for power generation, irrigation, and industrial and private use, while providing security against droughts and some protection against floods .
The key to successful increased investment in water infrastructure st proportionally increase investment in the institutions that manage water.
If the infrastructure is poorly managed, it will not help to improve people's health or support economic growth: the management of water and water management must work hand in hand.
Infrastructure can and should be developed in parallel with sound institutions, good governance, respect for the environment and equitable sharing of costs and benefits.
A policy of investment in water that reduces the vulnerability of the poor and offers basic access to water for all requires a personalized and effective partnership of donor countries, developing country governments, the private sector and local communities.
The delegates of the World Water Forum will have ample opportunity to forge and strengthen these partnerships.
If successful, the benefits that will benefit poor people around the world will be immense.
Germany in a state of economic shock.
Over the past ten years, Germany has experienced the slowest economic growth in the European Union and Europe the slower growth of the world.
From 1995 to 2005, German growth has exceeded 14.6%, while the average of the old EU was 24%, that of States - US 39.9%, and that of the world economy 45 6%.
What - which is so poorly of Germany?
According to Franz M√ºntefering, leader of the Social - Democratic Party at the head of Germany, it is simply because the country is already where others want to go.
Slow German growth, says - it is a sign of natural convergence.
This theory is far from convincing.
Germany has recently been overtaken in terms of per capita income in many EU countries, including Ireland, the United - Kingdom, the Netherlands - the Netherlands and France, and its growth is slower than theirs.
Another, more plausible theory is that over the last fifteen years several external challenges or shocks have hit the country simultaneously.
Trapped by its rigidity, extensive social system and a highly regulated labor market, Germany was unable to react to these shocks and began to experience problems.
This theory is not unlike that of the British historian Arnold Toynbee, according to which empires collapse because they are unable to respond to external challenges.
The first shock was intensified globalization, which has brought an influx of low-wage competition.
Although globalization is a gradual process, it gained momentum when China decided to get into the game.
China is ten times the size of Japan, and Japan had not been very easy to manage.
Precision instruments and the German optical equipment, for example, lost their competitive edge when Japan entered the scene.
The second shock was that of European integration, including the extension to the north and south.
The dismantling of the EU's internal borders expanded suddenly the size of national markets and caused the economies of scale provided.
But this has tended to benefit small European countries that large, and involved more competition for Germany, Europe's biggest economy.
Take Nokia, the mobile phone maker.
Thanks to economies of scale made possible by the common market, Nokia was able to fully exploit its inventions, while Germany's Siemens recently decided to give up the mobile phone market.
The third shock was the euro. The European currency caused a rapid convergence of long-term interest rates, which in some countries reached up to 5-7 percentage points higher than in Germany.
Freed from the risks related to exchange rates, international investors no longer demanded a risk premium from these countries and were willing to provide them all the funds on favorable terms, which was previously the preserve of Germany.
Europe does not draw as profits because capital is now better distributed and growth stimulated by movement of German savings to the remote and disadvantaged areas formerly of the euro area.
However, the benefit is questionable for German workers who also would have liked this capital.
The fourth shock came in the form of enlargement to the east of the EU, which caused extraordinary opportunities for trade and investment, but also hand out flood of cheap.
On average wage levels in the ten countries that joined the EU in 2004 only 14% of those in West Germany.
The low wage competition has led to substantial outsourcing and off of activities - shore that allowed German companies to remain competitive by reducing their demand for domestic labor.
Since neither the unions nor the German social system could not accept wage cuts, the result was higher unemployment and slower growth.
The fifth shock was the unification of Germany, a failure in terms of economy.
GDP per working-age person in East Germany accounted for 61% of the level of West Germany in 1996, but fell to 59% today.
The slow growth of the country has reduced the German average, while the enormous demand for public funds are widening public debt.
The weak fiscal position has in turn undermined investors' confidence, with obvious implications for economic growth.
These five shocks constitute historical developments for the world as a whole, but problematic for Germany.
If the country wants to meet its challenges and continue to grow, it must relax its labor market.
Only if wages adjust downward to accommodate the new global environment as German workers become competitive again, and the country returns to a low unemployment rate, exploiting its human capital up the capacity constraint.
The new government that voters will probably choose in September will be faced with the difficult task of putting the Germans face the reality and introduce the necessary reforms.
Only then will we know whether Germany is able to face the challenge that awaits Toynbee.
Lessons of the tsunami.
Many lessons emerge from the tsunami, caused so much devastation and loss of life in Asia.
This is evidence of globalization, while television brought vivid images of the destruction of homes worldwide.
Indeed, it is in these moments - where the world really look like a global village.
Of course, it seems that the information on the scale of the disaster take longer to reach President Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas.
But finally he decided to interrupt his vacation to offer aid, the amount has been continuously revised upward in an international competition which promised to benefit those who are desperately waiting to be helped.
US aid still appeared niggardly when compared with the amounts offered by countries with a fraction of US wealth.
Australia, which is sparsely populated, offered more than double US assistance, Japan promised 50% from the Americas and Europe committed to an amount five times.
This has led many observers to point out that the richest country in the world was in fact the most destitute in terms of international aid, especially when compared to the sums involved in the defense and war.
The disaster was international, so it - it appropriate that the United Nations take the lead in coordinating the humanitarian effort.
Unfortunately, in an effort that was widely seen as another attempt to undermine multilateralism, the United - States tried to lead a "core group" of the assistance program, ignoring the incessant efforts within the region and under the aegis of the UN.
Whatever the reason for America, it subsequently decided wisely join the United Nations in their efforts.
Rhetoric used to save the face of the Bush administration claiming that it was to establish a core group in the absence of any other effort has slowly been abandoned.
The response of some countries in the region was truly impressive, showing the progress in the implementation of efficient and effective governments.
Myriad details were addressed: Thailand sent ambassadors to the affected areas of the country to help meet the needs of citizens, helped those who lost everything, passport and goods, to go home, nursed the wounded, put in place body identification systems and treated the difficulties posed by shortages of body bags and the lack of refrigerated areas for the conservation of the body.
Countries, like Thailand have perceived that they could cope with the financial consequences of self - called for humanitarian aid to be sent to other countries.
They did not ask one thing: Reducing tariffs and better access to foreign markets.
They did not ask for charity, just a chance to earn their own income.
They received in response, at least at the time I write this, that implacable silence.
Moreover, the G7 has chosen to make a significant contribution by offering to relieve the debt.
This is particularly important in the case of Indonesia, whose debt service amounted to $ 132 billion USD, 70 is owed to public creditors or guaranteed by government agencies.
Even without the horrors of the tsunami, the weight of this debt would have been a huge handicap in the development of this country recovering from the consequences of the financial crisis of 1997.
Indeed, the Indonesian debt relief is a compelling case to the extent that most of the debts were incurred in connection with loans to the corrupt Suharto government.
The leaders knew or should have known, that part of the total money lent was not to be attributed to the development of Indonesia.
In addition, part of the debt was incurred during the crisis of 1997 - 1998, aggravated and extended by the policies imposed by the IMF.
No one pretends that it is possible to prevent or alter the forces of nature.
Rather, we must learn to manage.
There is now talk of improved warning systems to prevent possible tsunami.
We have, however, received a warning in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãclimate change.
Most countries recognize this and have come together in Rio and Kyoto to act together: even if it is insufficient, the Kyoto Protocol was designed as a step in the right direction.
Unfortunately, global warming will probably destroy the same countries which have been ravaged by the tsunami.
The low-lying islands like the Maldives will be submerged.
We are not a global village.
After contesting the scientific evidence highlighting the problems, the biggest polluter on the planet, the United - States, simply refused to act - beyond the simple call to a certain voluntary restriction that we see some in action in America anyway.
The international community must think again to the treatment of this aberrant member who refuses to take global responsibilities of citizenship.
Optimists say that technology will solve these problems.
Realists see that in the long race between technology and the environment, it seems that the technology is so far the big loser.
Nature, as shown by the tsunami, has its own clock.
As we will not have learned to respect it, we will all miss the train.
The accuracy of the experts.
Every day, experts bombard us with their views on topics as varied as Iraqi insurgents, Bolivian coca growers, European central bankers and the Politburo of North Korea.
How are - they credible, these experts?
An optimistic view is that as long as those selling expertise compete vigorously for the attention of discriminating buyers (the media), market mechanisms will assure quality control.
The experts published in the opinion pages of newspapers or appear on television and radio must enjoy a good reputation since otherwise they would have been eliminated.
Skeptics, however, warn that the media we impose their choice of speakers and are less interested in reasoned debate than by way of catering to popular prejudices.
As a result, fame could be negatively, not positively, in the long-term accuracy.
Until recently, no one knew who was right because no one was keeping the results of these experts.
But research spread over 20 years now suggest that the skeptics are closer to the truth.
I describe the project in detail in my book Expert Political Judgment: How good is it? How can we know?
[The political expert judgment: that is - it?
How do I know? The original idea was to solicit thousands of predictions from hundreds of experts about the fates of dozens of countries, and then score the predictions for accuracy.
We found that not only the media do not eliminate bad ideas, but that they often favor, especially when the truth is too messy to be packaged neatly.
Proofs are divided into two categories.
First, as the skeptics warned, when hordes of pundits are jostling for the limelight, many are tempted to claim that they know more than in reality.
Experts providing the best and the worst are those that are most likely to exaggerate.
Between 1985 and 2005, the most optimistic forecasts of experts were 10 who exaggerated the chances of big positive changes in both financial markets (eg, a Dow Jones 36 000) and in terms of world politics (eg peace in the Middle - East and dynamic growth in sub - Saharan Africa).
They assigned probabilities of 65% to rosy scenarios that materialized only 15% of cases.
During the same period, the most pessimistic experts are even more misguided, exaggerating the risk of adverse changes where also overly optimistic experts had good news too loaded, and adding as many others (I'm still waiting impending disintegration of Canada, Nigeria, India, Indonesia, South Africa, Belgium and Sudan).
They assigned probabilities of 70% to bleak scenarios that materialized only 12% of cases.
Moreover, as yet had once predicted skeptics claiming the experts more rarely pay penalties for their mistakes.
Indeed, the media give them attention while neglecting their humbler colleagues.
We can see this process in sharp relief when, following the philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin, we classify experts as "hedgehogs" or "foxes."
Hedgehogs are those who have great ideas and fall in love with grand theories: libertarianism, Marxism, environmentalism, etc. ..
Their self-confidence can be contagious.
They know how to maintain the momentum of a discussion by multiplying reasons why they are right and others are wrong.
That's what wins them media acclaim.
But they do not know when to slam the mental brakes by making concessions to other points of view.
They take their theories too seriously.
The result: hedgehogs make more mistakes, but they pile up more hits on Google.
Eclectic foxes are better at curbing their ideological enthusiasms.
They feel more comfortable with protracted uncertainty about who is right even in bitter debates, conceding gaps and give legitimacy to opposing views.
They sprinkle their conversations that limit the reach of their arguments: "but," "however," "although".
Because they avoid over-simplification, foxes make fewer mistakes.
Foxes are often agree with hedgehogs up to a point, before complicating things: "Yes, my colleague is right when he says that the Saudi monarchy is vulnerable, but remember - that coups States are rare and that the government has many means of repressing the opposition. "
Imagine your job in the media depends on your ability to expand your audience.
Who would choose - you, an expert who balances conflicting arguments and concludes that the most likely outcome is that nothing will change, or an expert who holds the audience spellbound with radical Islamists who take control and cause Soaring oil prices?
In short, the qualities that make foxes more accurate also make them less popular.
At this point, uncharitable skeptics chortle that we get the media we deserve.
But that's not fair.
No society has yet created a reliable method to evaluate the results of the experts.
Even citizens who prize accuracy have little way of knowing that they are sacrificing it when they switch channels from boring foxes to charismatic hedgehogs.
This is where stage a modest proposal that applies to all democracies: the marketplace of ideas works better if it is easier for citizens to see the exchanges between accuracy and entertainment, or between accuracy and loyalty to a party.
Would read only - they no more expert reports have been mostly right?
In this case, the experts could become more reliable by showing more humility, and political debate might begin to sound less shrill.
Okay, it is not easy to create methods to assess who was right and across the spectrum of reasonable opinion.
But in a world where, as Yeats said, "the worst are full of passionate intensity and the best lack all conviction," it is worth trying.
What future for Europe?
In many ways, 2005 annus horribilis represents Europe.
It started well, with the approval of the proposed Constitutional Treaty by the Spanish voters, but it turned sour when French and Dutch voters rejected it shortly after.
Those votes partly reflected the dissatisfaction of voters vis - a - vis domestic policies and their disappointment with the government's conduct of EU affairs.
Governments are then dispatched to offer ever more of these unsatisfactory business.
In the days following the elections, they failed to agree on the budget of the European Union for the period 2007-2013.
French and British leaders have engaged in a quarrel which defeated the summit that followed, just before the Great - Britain takes over the rotating presidency of the European Union in July.
Generally, countries use the presidency of the European Union to show their ability to solve problems and advance the European Union.
But since early December, Great - Britain slumbers.
In addition to the burial of the proposed Constitutional Treaty, it has largely abandoned the budget issue.
There is very little chance that it manages to pass the budget this year, and unless quickly resolve the dispute, the EU will have no operating budget for 2007.
Although the budget eventually adopted, the Austrian Presidency, which begins on January 1, absolutely sure to depressing business.
The biggest problem is the European inability to accelerate its growth and provide jobs for its citizens.
This is mainly due to three main, France, Germany and Italy, which produce 70% of European GDP.
The collective response, adopted in 2000, was that of the "Lisbon Strategy", which aims to make the EU "the most dynamic and competitive economy in knowledge in the world" in 2010.
More realistically, it is designed to provide governments with the encouragement needed to support reforms of everything that slows economic growth and productivity.
This involves the clash of myriad interest groups from industry lobbies to trade unions and frozen bureaucrats who have (so far) successfully protected their field.
The strategy rests on peer pressure and is to point the finger at governments that do not progress to confuse.
In practice, however, peer pressure has turned into peer collusion.
When leaders of the European Union met last spring to take stock of their progress, they admitted pitiful way that the objectives of the Lisbon strategy had little chance of being achieved.
They could, at best, now stop pretending to focus on this strategy and improve their progress in other areas.
Unfortunately, Jos√© Manuel Barroso, who chaired the summit in 2000, when he was Prime Minister of Portugal and current President of the European Commission, had put his presidency at stake in the case of the Lisbon Strategy.
We should expect to see the defending desperate way.
One of the few good ideas from the Lisbon Strategy was to remove barriers to trade in services.
Competition services in Europe is restricted by innumerable national regulations that, for instance, strictly determine the regulated professions, such as hairdressing or plumbing.
One of the basic characteristics of recent decades remains the significant increase in productivity in the service sector to the states - the US, but this has absolutely no place in Europe.
Guess why.
Because services account for 70% of European GDP and the potential impact of improved competition is important.
It is still politically difficult to remove protections.
The European Commission has made a proposal in 2005, at a time when the constitution was submitted to vote.
It is not surprising that this proposal has quickly was abandoned.
Today, a large number of private interest groups trying to dilute to take away all its significance, this battle will undoubtedly be placed on the agenda of the European Union for 2006.
Europe also blocks the progress of the Doha Round in international trade negotiations, due to the agricultural lobby fighting to preserve its subsidies.
Many governments who fear their farmers to the point of having no choice but to not give in, whatever the circumstances.
Europe has accepted the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa single trade policy.
When disagreements are as deep as they are in the case of agriculture, there is no latitude to conduct successful negotiations.
There is little reason for optimism.
And what will be the future of the ECB, which has to adjust its interest rates by 0.25% after 30 months of waiting.
Experts can not agree on the relevance of this decision, but no one agrees with the many political leaders who say that this small increase will derail the small recovery in economic growth.
The acidity of political attacks on the ECB might trigger dangerous debate about restricting its independence.
Even if it is out of question that to happen, because it would require changing the EU treaty, all the brouhaha is not healthy.
This diverts the ECB's objectives and is a consolidation of the idea that Europe is a bad thing, and, above all, this will be used as a scapegoat by defaulting governments for their failures.
We can expect reactions to other anti - BCE.
Europe is - she in a rut?
The current management team has greatly disappointed.
Yet we have a chance to see light at the end of the tunnel with their gradual replacement.
In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel seems more positive on the issue of Europe and brought about reforms than its predecessor, but it has its hands tied by the grand coalition that supports it.
In France, President Jacques Chirac, quintessential image of the leader hostage of his lobbies, is staggering helplessly toward the end of his term in 2007.
The two leaders approached to replace Dominique de Villepin and Nicolas Sarkozy, both in government, compete on the bottom of the reform of orders a day, but the years preceding an election does not encourage radical changes .
Italy, meanwhile, will have to decide whether to replace Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who shows no interest in reform and European affairs, by Romano Prodi, careful and former President of the European Commission.
Tony Blair, once an ardent defender of Europe (at least according to the low standards of Great - Britain), might finally have to cede power to Gordon Brown, who is well known for its lack of warmth towards integration European.
Fortunately, Great - Britain has always been an outsider.
Finally, whatever the light at the end of the tunnel, it can shine - not before 2007, after the French elections.
Tame politicians on both sides of the Atlantic.
Despite occasional grumbles from politicians, no one seriously doubts the independence of the European Central Bank nor the fact that monetary policy in effect in the euro zone is therefore well protected against political pressures.
But the recent death of the Pact of Stability and Growth, killed by Germany, his father, with France acting as co - conspirator and willing accomplice, reminds us of a key lesson: elected politicians find it difficult if not impossible to waive immense power in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãtax policy.
This applies across the Atlantic.
The US Federal Reserve is of course extremely independent.
But any attempt to limit the fiscal discretion of the US federal government in the manner of the Stability Pact (for example, the Gramm / Rudman law infamous Clinton-era) always collapses at the end to pressure the President and Congress.
In election years, monetary policy can be used to stimulate, if not more, economy, as fiscal policy, and that is the goal of politicians.
But the indiscriminate use of one of these two mechanisms to achieve short-term risk of creating long-term cost targets, justifying some restrictions to the freedom of politicians to influence macroeconomic policies.
When politicians can control inflation by exercising a decisive influence on central banks, they can use their power to devalue the burden of public debt, avoiding the need for additional taxation to pay off that debt.
This was the great lesson of the 1970s and early 1980s, when rampant inflation forced politicians to give up this power to the independent central banks, which alone could convince markets that price stability would be restored.
Monetary policy does not, however, a unique mode of economic policy development.
Aspects of fiscal policy could also be delegated to independent bureaucrats in order to keep politicians in line.
Why, for example, do not entrust an independent bureaucracy some redistributive goals or control over the level of public investment or deficit management?
An independent fiscal authority could arguably apply the long-term goals of a company in these areas better than politicians who have their eyes on the next election.
Indeed, in principle, it is impossible to understand why monetary policy and fiscal policy should be seen so differently, one being entirely delegated to a bureaucratic agency and the other completely discretionary and left to the politicians .
So, why this large difference in reality it exists in America and Europe?
Because fiscal policy is the main tool used by politicians to attract and retain the support of a winning coalition of voters, composed of retired civil servants and middle-class homeowners, while imposing costs on the coalition loser.
It is not necessary to please 100% of the voters, but just enough to win.
The fiscal card is critical in choosing which groups of voters to buy.
Independent tax authorities (or tax rules such as the Stability Pact) hinder the political use of fiscal policy, which is expensive.
After all, if politicians can not win elections by taking money from some voters (including future generations who will have to bear part of the invoice) to give back to others, they will have to work much harder to show some ability in producing public benefits for all.
This is a much more difficult task!
Obviously, the policy also has redistributive effects.
Think about the different effects of interest rates on debtors versus creditors.
However, monetary policy is a much more awkward way, indirect and imprecise way of choosing winners and losers than fiscal policy.
Independent central banks can occasionally be a pain for politicians, but at least they can be used as scapegoats when necessary, a role whose political benefits outweigh the costs of losing control over the tool useful.
These considerations should guide the choice of the device to replace the Stability Pact in Europe.
It is now quite clear that national governments, especially those of large countries will never accept substantial limitations on their fiscal discretion.
They may have temporarily withdrawn their freedom of fiscal maneuver long enough to allow the launch of the euro, but in normal conditions, national governments claim their tax territory.
The European Commission must stop delivering a rear battle - garde only weakens its credibility, especially in the eyes of small countries, which are the only ones on which it is possible to apply pressure to agree to unwanted tax rules.
Realistically, the Commission can only ask European national governments to ensure that their tax accounts are transparent and clear.
It is impossible to prevent the political use of fiscal policy.
But at least the tax share of a country should not be hidden in obscure footnotes page of his budgets.
Even this limited goal may be hard to achieve.
A strategic lack of transparency is in the interests clever politicians who want to please a lobby by hiding the costs of the public's largesse from the majority of citizens.
The rules governing the behavior of politicians should not be written as if disinterested, well-intentioned officials would apply.
Politicians are willing to go to great lengths to satisfy their supporters and win elections.
We can at best hope to ensure that the worst acts they do is done out in the open.
The European Union on its promises to Turkey?
There are more than forty years, Turkey applied for associate member of the European Economic Community.
The 1963 Association Agreement created a special relationship, crowned by the Customs Union in 1996.
During all these years, European governments have continued to reaffirm that Turkey could become a full member state, provided they meet the accession criteria.
Formal recognition of his candidacy in 1999 has pushed Turkey to undertake unprecedented set of reforms in the field of human rights and minority rights, including the abolition of the death penalty, the adoption of safeguards against torture, promotion of religious freedoms and equality between the sexes and restricting the role of the military in politics.
If the European Union considers that the accession criteria have been met, it must begin negotiations in early 2005.
Otherwise the EU fails to fulfill its political commitments and would seriously undermine its credibility in the world.
Yet all over Europe, this membership is viewed with skepticism, because of the size of Turkey and its economic situation, for fear of mass immigration and especially "cultural and social differences", a euphemism which reference to Islam.
There is no denying that some of these factors represent significant challenges.
But they are often exaggerated and certainly not insurmountable.
Negotiations with Turkey would be lengthy and accession may not occur before 2015.
This period would allow Turkey as the Union to prepare.
With 80 million people, Turkey would become one of the largest Member States of the European Union.
But the role of the country's size is limited in the decision making process of the EU, where political influence depends more on economic power.
In addition, Turkey has for decades been a responsible member of many European institutions, and there is no reason to think she would behave in the Union differently.
Because of its weak economy, Turkey would qualify for significant support.
But such transfers depend on the EU's financial policies at the time of accession, the outcome of negotiations and developments in the Turkish economy.
In all cases, the "cap" budget practiced by the EU would avoid an explosion in the financial costs of Turkish membership.
Immigration should not cause unnecessary concern.
Human mobility is limited, and Turkish workers would probably have the right to move freely within the European Union after a long period of transition, can - not before 2025.
Given the expected strong growth of the Turkish economy and declining birthrate, experts estimate that there would be about 2.7 million immigrants.
Meanwhile, the decline and aging of the population in most of Europe will have made the necessary immigration.
But among the probable country of origin of migrants, Turkey offers the best chance of successful adaptation.
It is Turkey's Muslim population that creates the most emotion.
Many feel that Turkey has no place in a European society based on a culture and Christian traditions.
It is also feared that Islamists do one day Turkey a fundamentalist state.
As unlikely as it is, because secularism is deeply rooted in Turkey, this risk can not be ruled out entirely.
But there is in any democracy, where radical groups could hijack the democratic process to achieve their ends.
The best way to avoid such a disaster is likely to strengthen the democratic system and for it to firmly anchor Turkey in a bloc of countries too democratic.
As for the EU, it must decide whether it wants to be a "Christian club" closed, or on the contrary an open, strengthened and enriched by its cultural and religious diversity.
The accession of Turkey would bring a strong response, with particular resonance in the Muslim world.
The need to challenge the arguments against Turkey's accession that its benefits are rarely mentioned: a unique geopolitical position at the crossroads of the Balkans, South Caucasus, Central Asia and the Middle - East - regions of of vital importance to the security of Europe -; a major transit country for energy supplies; military capabilities at a time when the EU is developing its new European defense policy; and strong economic potential, with a hand from? piece young and vibrant.
At the same time, we must consider the risks of rejecting Turkey: the probability of failure of the reform process, which would favor the extremist movements and cause instability and political unrest at the EU's door.
The entry of Turkey into the European Union opens up broad prospects and also brings challenges.
But the prospects are far superior.
The game of democracy.
In Calcutta, when a kid younger arose and insisted to participate in the game that my friends were playing, we let go, but only after whispering into the ear of the other words.
When we were children, it was important to master the art of cruel.
The technique of the.
What applies to children and adults also applies to international institutions.
Indeed, organizations that are officially committed to involving all nations in their decision making are often controlled by small groups of powerful nations, while others merely perform a mock participation.
The World Trade Organization (WTO), so - called based on the principle of one country one vote, actually see the agenda behind the scenes programmed by a small group of nations.
It is now common for international organizations that publish a report involving all "stakeholders" and reflect their opinions.
The changing ratio is then generally presented on a website and all without exception (NGOs, trade unions and other civil society organizations) are invited to make suggestions.
This promotes a sense of participation, but as a friend, versed in these matters, I found out, finally the secret is to ignore all the comments received and prepare the report as if there were no Web site as if no interest had been identified.
Increasingly, free expression of opinion does not influence or control the behavior of the government.
Take the United - States.
The Americans have expressed their views freely, in newspapers, on television, in the discussion forums on the Internet, on the planned George Bush's war in Iraq.
Never before such opposition was manifested toward war.
It happened, or rather what did not happen, is admirable: almost no effort was made to muzzle criticism of the government, as is the case in China and several dictatorships.
But the great democracies of the world, states - the US, India, UK, etc. are increasingly adept at banning freely expressed opinions to restrict government actions.
The war that is taking place in Iraq is probably the best evidence.
Leaving aside the immorality of the war, and God knows how it is immoral! I wish to draw attention to this increasing ability and the tendency of democracies to "deal" with (thus neutralize) public opinion.
They adopted the strategy.
When democracies mature, they become more than ever paid in the management of public opinion and, in most cases, in shaping public opinion.
Each comment Hans Blix on the UN inspections in Iraq, he led the members of the Bush administration paraphrased what Blix said.
This paraphrase changed subtly Blix's comments to support the arguments of America in favor of the war.
Retouched by repeating the comments, the Bush administration hoped that public opinion would rally to war.
It can be difficult to overthrow a totalitarian regime and organizing elections, but the hardest task is to transform the votes of the electors in a true democracy.
For people accustomed to living in a totalitarian state, it is no easy thing to learn the meaning of "participation."
Hence the popular belief that democracies, like wine, improve with age.
While this may be true, maturity has its own drawback.
While the citizens of a democracy continuously learn to participate, democratic governments continuously learn to get their way despite the participation.
It is no use denying that civic participation too often serves only to legitimize false - pretenses.
We must recognize and confront this problem to prevent established democracies from atrophying and to help new democracies become more effective.
For it is not only morally wrong to leave nations and communities feeling marginalized and voiceless; this is the best way to frustration, rage and terrorism.
Redistribution of governance in Asia.
Governance (how decisions affecting the public interest are taken) has become a key factor in determining the pace of development of a country. Successful governance brings resolved changes.
Failures are sanctioned by the unrest, discontent and stagnation.
April 18 will be held in Bangkok a conference to consider the prospects for improved governance in Asia.
Asian policy makers today face a very different environment than their predecessors fifty years earlier.
The Asian population has more than doubled since 1950, mostly in the poorest countries.
The political system of the country was suitable for unimportant people, stable and rural.
Today, these companies must also manage the urban centers expanded as multiple talents and demands from urban populations.
The global economy has changed dramatically.
The increased flow of goods, capital and knowledge in the world implies that foreign organizations and individuals have more influence, complicating even more the task of national governments concerned with the internal management of their own nations.
Thus, international institutions such as the WTO have changed frames of reference within which economic decisions are taken.
Changes in local economies are radicals.
In parts of Asia, living standards soared.
Foreign investment region-specific or even external altered the structure of domestic economies.
The old models of economic growth, however, such as export orientation and selective use of import restrictions which produced satisfactory results in East Asia in the last century, are less well adapted to the new laws international exchange.
We must therefore create new rules of the game.
In most Asian countries, formal rules need to be simplified and applied more fairly.
A "back to basics" approach is essential in three interrelated areas in which national governments must take over the management: reducing corruption, strengthening property rights and the consistent application of legal principles.
There are few countries that can score points in these areas.
The close links between the business world and governments have been accused of being responsible for the financial crises in South - East Asia in 1997.
In parts of South Asia, violent conflict and the power of vested interests have endangered the legal principles.
The result of such failures is that the elites prosper while the masses suffer.
A clear structure of formal rules is the best antidote to these failures because they reinforce informal practices which are based on both companies.
Business does not lead to court but in meetings where trust and reputation are essential.
As demonstrated by Robert Putnam, social theorist, "social capital" (networks, norms and social trust that facilitate cooperation and coordination for the benefit of all) as a parameter is a result of economic growth.
Empowered to as many members of civil society as possible door to instill more surely for specific purposes in efforts to advance the nations.
The government, the private sector and civil society all have a role to play in strengthening social capital.
But successful interactions between these sectors simply can not be desired without further input and it is essential that the role of each is clearly defined.
Many Asian governments recognize the need to redefine their role more clearly.
Following the 1997 crisis, governments have withdrawn a little more markets, recognizing the limits of their ability to act and how important it is to let private enterprise to develop.
Yet governments have a role to play in fostering an enabling environment within which markets can operate.
Regulatory monitoring and enforcement are important but different ways of working (say through joint partnerships between the public sector and the private sector) are increasingly adopted in many innovative Asian economies.
The valuable role of civil society in the expression of opinions that EU governments can not reach is also recognized, but its relationship to the government and the business world is characterized mostly by conflict than cooperation.
The role of the private sector in decision making must also often be clarified: where companies are too influential from governments, needs to operate profitably can lead them to policies favoring the elites rather than the masses .
The metaphor of the game (with its rules and participants) leads some to think in terms of international competition.
It's not very healthy to the extent that our interdependent world is not a zero-sum game, where gains of a nation are the losses of another.
In fact, the nations are not engaged in a competition pitting each other as is the case for companies.
Trade represent a positive sum game in which all countries benefit from the exploitation of their comparative advantage areas.
Good governance can enhance this positive-sum game, and ensure that businesses and individuals in these countries in the profits.
It is a good way to think of governments as entities competing (providing a better service to their people than other governments).
Which therefore gives an important role in international comparisons of systems.
In this spirit, the conference of UNCTAD - UNDP this month - it ("Governance in Asia: Underpinning Competitiveness in a Global Economy," Governance in Asia: strengthening competitiveness in the global economy), will bring together policy makers across Asia to discuss the challenges of governance must face in Asia.
The role of government (the only actor to have the legitimacy of a popular mandate) is fundamentally important in the direction of a nation going forward.
The private sector and civil society are, of course, increasingly important partners for governments.
The functioning of the relationship between these participants will profoundly influence the future of development in Asia.
The 18th Brumaire of Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Replacing a governor they elected only a year earlier by Arnold Schwarzenegger must have given to California voters an enormous pleasure, although tinged with guilt.
Some members of the opposition in Germany would love to do the same with Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der, although they have not (yet!
) Film star found to replace it.
Several other European governments also experiencing some unpopularity shortly after their election.
This is also true in non-European countries, such as the recently acclaimed Brazilian President Luis Inacio "Lula" da Silva, let alone the President of South - to Korea Roh Moo - hyun, the latter having called for a referendum to stop decline in its popularity.
It seems that nowadays, the effects of electoral success quickly fade.
Each country must - therefore adopt a recall procedure to preserve the legitimacy of governments?
Absolutely not.
Democracy, to borrow the words of the philosopher Karl Popper, is defined by the ability to remove those in power without violence; it is then, according to this definition, a method of trial and error.
But leaders must have the opportunity to govern.
They need to have a chance to make mistakes, as long as their decisions do not affect the foundations of the democratic order it - yourself.
The method of trial and error implies the possibility of being wrong before trying again.
The first mistake of California voters is about "the lure of the immediate", which is hardly surprising in a state where instant gratification is so - called a fundamental value.
But this desire seems overwhelming at times democracies in post - modern of all countries around the world.
Indeed, today democracy has taken a pop culture fads that disappear as quickly as they came; pop group hysterical fans today will be forgotten tomorrow and there are plenty of others waiting in the wings.
In politics this can be dangerous because it encourages quick decisions, regardless of their size, according to popular opinion that momentarily prevails.
The call for an increased number of referendums reflects and heightens this trend.
Referendums are, for the most part snapshots.
Switzerland, with its generally slower pace and its thorough political debates before the election, is perhaps the only exception to this rule.
Generally, referendums are used to measure the popularity of political leaders at some point, regardless of the issue at stake.
If and when the Great - Britain will decide on the adoption of the euro, it is more than likely the result of this vote will teach us many things about Tony Blair and the European Union, but little on merits of the common currency.
So the case for representative government remain significant.
Democracy is rule by organizing debates, taking important decisions after thorough deliberations, at least in large countries, should be conducted in a parliament through elected representatives.
Sometimes parliaments wish to act quickly, and they can - be forced to do so, but as a rule they take enough time to examine the issues in detail.
Parliaments talk before forming conclusions, hence their name.
Take the case of Germany, a country where some leaders of the Christian Democrats opposition group burning desire to reduce the Schr√∂der government to nothing.
Obviously, the proposed reforms and already partly enacted by the government are unpopular and there is virtually no doubt that a year after his re-election, the coalition of Social Democrats and Greens has very little chance of convincing to polls.
But who knows what the voters think in three years, when the government's mandate expires?
By the next election, the voters, in retrospect, could realize that there was no real alternative to Schr√∂der's policies and it is even possible that the expected benefits of such painful reforms they become apparent to by then.
Leaders need time to make and implement decisions as unpopular as popular.
They need courage to lead often precarious parliamentary majorities in the way of a popularity that has its ups and downs.
That is why they have to take the most painful measures during their first year in office then relent in the following elections.
Precarious partnership of Prime Minister Tony Blair and the Minister of Finance Gordon Brown illustrates this type of tactic.
Leaders who never risk their popularity are not worthy of their position.
California has set a bad example, and Californians will probably pay a high price for their mistake.
It will, however, probably not as high as that paid by France a century and a half ago, when Louis Napoleon, elected by universal suffrage, has turned through an exceedingly popular referendum by Napoleon III, it being the last vote in France until the end of the Second Empire.
Californians, of course, will not be denied the right to vote, but their stubbornness may cause unpredictable and irresponsible form of state politics.
It is certain that democracy implies a limited period of time during which the powerful of this world must be able to exercise their power without challenge.
An effective democracy must give them enough time to win the approval of the elected representatives to legislate and to implement their program.
These two requirements are contradictory in nature, but a representative parliamentary democracy is still the best way to ensure a balance between the two.
Any other system would be as stable as the ten best pop songs of the week.
Herbert Hoover and the Stability Pact.
In mid - July the good and great finance ministers of member countries of the European Monetary Union (EMU) gathered to discuss the economic situation in the euro area.
They ruminated the most recent economic forecasts, which project an annual GDP growth in the euro area this year sadly anemic level of 0.7%.
Then, with the exception of a single minister, they all decided that their economy was still suffering a bit of this infamy or worse.
They reaffirmed their commitment to the Stability and Growth Pact, which requires countries of the euro zone tax increases and spending cuts, increasing the pressure on their economies.
This Pact is already pushing Germany to the recession, the Italian government is struggling to revise its growth forecasts fast enough to avoid being overtaken by a faulty production index.
Yet this does not seem enough to force officials to review their priorities.
Some EU finance ministers still view the Stability Pact as the "cornerstone" of the EMU.
Others speak of the importance of obeying the "rules of the game."
Others believe that the recovery should be "in the spirit of the Covenant," even if it is essential to restore economic growth.
Seen from the other side of the Atlantic, these reasons seem extremely strange.
The last time the US government has tried to ensure a balanced budget despite the recession, it was there seventy years, under the presidency of Herbert Hoover at the beginning of the Great Depression.
Since a broad consensus has emerged States - United on depression cycles that require the use of budget deficits to relieve suffering, promote the general demand and rush the recovery.
Economists call these tax extensive cycles of "automatic stabilizers".
When household incomes are falling, it is the same for public sector revenues.
Tax cuts can increase incomes.
But mainly, when household incomes fall, government social spending increases, triggering the recovery in demand, output, investment and employment.
Lower taxes and higher spending widen the budget deficit, but in a healthy and effective way.
On the American side of the Atlantic, the usefulness of these fiscal stabilizers is not questioned.
On the contrary, every threat of recession, political debate revolves around their building by pulses.
Any more than that is only a matter of fiscal discipline.
Whenever proposals for the amendment of the Constitution for balanced budget surfaced, proposals have always offered exemptions not only in war but also in a recession.
We know the origins of the Stability and Growth Pact.
The countries of northern Europe, particularly Germany and the Netherlands - Netherlands, are always pleased to maintaining a low ratio between debt and GDP and relatively low interest rates.
When these countries have found that the countries of southern Europe, Italy and Greece in particular, usually had a high ratio between debt and GDP and relatively high nominal interest rates because of their apparent tolerance to inflation.
The countries of northern Europe were concerned that the southern deficits can eventually create pressure on the partial monetization of their debt through inflation of the euro, or more precisely, their leaders feared that investors scared for the same reasons demand higher interest rates.
The Stability and Growth Pact was intended to keep the debt of the countries of southern Europe at low levels, thus keeping the interest rate low enough to reassure investors on the fact that the national debt would never allowed to rise enough to generate serious inflationary pressure.
Yet if we examine the economic problems of the euro zone today, the threat of nominal interest rates higher long-term certainly not one of the top ten investor concerns.
At worst, investors do not fear that high debt pushing governments to slow inflation by printing more money.
The problems of the European Union come from a stagnant production index, high structural unemployment, weak productivity growth, unnecessary and unfair Common Agricultural Policy and the prediction of structural adjustment for the expansion of the European Union itself - even.
From one point of view, it is good that the ministers of euro zone finance are willing to maintain their national debt at the lowest long-term: it is a sign that the victories over inflation won in years 1970 will not be simply ignored.
But it is dangerous to become fixated on the past.
There is no surer route to economic disaster than historical blinders.
Herbert Hoover as was shown when we consider only the economic problems of the previous generation, we may not see the dangers that lie directly under our eyes.
Ghosts of our past economy.
In the famous novel by Charles Dickens, "A Christmas Carol" ("A Christmas Carol"), Ebeneezer Scrooge, a businessman without a soul, is harassed by the Spirit of Christmas past.
Today, economists are similarly troubled by unwanted ghosts, as they reflect on the reappearance of economic ills we thought dead and buried long ago.
Whether Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Paul Krugman of Princeton, the Governors of the US Federal Reserve or anyone else in Japan, economists around the world are worried about deflation.
Concerns over the back of economic thought from fifty years ago, when economists had discovered that the only thing to do against deflation was to avoid it like the plague!
In 1933, Irving Fisher --the predecessor Milton Friedman at the head of the monetarist school am√©ricaine-- announced that governments should avoid large depressions by avoiding deflation.
The --the deflation steady and continuous decline of prix-- encouraged the business community and consumers cut spending and hoard liquidity.
This reduces the ability of businesses and banks to repay their debts and can trigger a series of bankruptcies huge destroying confidence in the financial system, which then feeds the fear and hoarding.
Such incentives to hoard rather than spend maintaining demand in low and continues to decline while unemployment grows and increases over a very long period of time even politicians and economists who defend vigorously the policies laissez - faire can not accept.
Thus, remains only the Keynesian solution: use monetary policy (lower interest rates) and fiscal (inflation of public spending and tax cuts) to keep the economy away from the abyss makes possible deflation.
However, if this question was settled more than fifty years ago, why returns - it haunt us?
Why it is a threat that worries both Japan today and deserves cares States - States?
In the late 1940s, who presided over the creation of an international economic order post - war tried to create an international monetary system that (a) would sufficiently stabilize exchange rates for producers and consumers escape the dangers of excessive and irrational fluctuations in exchange rates, (b) allow nations to establish their own macroeconomic policies, and (c) would prevent the catastrophic panics affecting not only banks and individuals, but entire nations which produced the destructive international financial crisis of the Great Depression.
This results in the creation of the Bretton system - Wood, where exchange rates are fixed but flexible, which became over the years the floating 1980s system.
Then came the 1990s.
Suddenly, incredibly destructive financial crises reappeared following popular panic in Mexico, Thailand, Korea, Brazil, etc., and resembled the US financial panic of 1873 or the Austrian Creditanstalt crisis in 1931.
The Argentine crisis of late 2001 looked like an extraordinary way to the Argentine crisis of Barings in 1890 - except that politicians and international bankers seem to have a much better idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat it to do to minimize the damage they seem to have today.
So if those who built the international monetary system of post - war worked to set up guard - rails to protect us from the dangers of international financial crises created by the popular panic, why this kind of crisis is reborn - it now ?
The truth is that economic policies are juggling a variety of possible disasters, trading one that seems more threatening to the one that seems more distant.
States - States, the Bush administration remains skeptical about the stimulating power of monetary policy and wants to maintain large budget deficits to reduce unemployment, hoping that the future dangers implied by persistent deficits - weakened investment, reduced growth, loss of trust, uncontrollable inflation and depreciation of change-- rates can be deftly manipulated or will prove that after the departure of the Bush presidency team.
In Europe, the European Central Bank believes that the danger of uncontrolled inflation following a loss of public confidence in its commitment to low inflation outweighs the costs of unemployment remains too high.
In developing countries, capital controls to prevent financial crises is seen as an obstacle to attracting capital needed for industrialization, and as a potential source of corruption as financial flows move from one way or another in the hands of the nephew by marriage of Vice - Minister of Finance.
Flexible exchange rates, designed to allow markets to indicate the confidence in the currency declines also put exporters in a difficult competitive position compared to producers in other countries where prices are abused by unpredictable exchange rates.
Even import substitution policies, strongly criticized today were originally adopted by developing countries for good (and bad) reasons: the protectionist closure of developed country markets during the Great Depression was the disastrous consequences for the economies of developing countries.
The ghosts of our past economic return to us because the lessons of this are still saturated.
Politicians and policy makers emphasize their economic approach as "the only Doctrine."
But what they do, in fact, is to manage the most important issues of the moment at the expense of the disappearance of institutions and policies established by their predecessors to control the problems they perceived as the most urgent.
Nocturnal visitors Ebeneezer Scrooge were able to convince him that he was wrong and to open his eyes to his mistakes.
Hopefully economists today will also benefit the lesson of their unwanted ghosts.
In the shadow of the Deutschmark.
Overcoming the Irish cocktail.
Justification for humanitarian intervention.
I visited the former Soviet republics of Central Asia in 1998 to take part in talks on the democratic development that has taken place (or should have been) in these newly independent countries.
My hosts were former communist leaders who now assumed the role of elected presidents more or less democratically.
Each of them spoke without constraints of institutions, democratic procedures and the rule of law.
But human rights were an entirely separate issue.
I presented in each country a list of political prisoners, asking what their fate.
In one country, the president immediately decided to free a man accused of plotting a coup.
But even this apparent success has proved morally ambiguous.
The president had not made a political decision: he granted a personal favor.
I received a gift in him - even just another demonstration of the arbitrary exercise of power of the president, not a proof of respect for moral principles.
In one country, I spoke with a leader of the Islamic fundamentalist opposition, which had launched into a long civil war against the government.
This man called himself president of the "Committee for national reconciliation."
Armed guards to the teeth surrounded him, while he strongly supported the notion of democratization.
Indeed, he considered this notion as the surest path to power because the vast majority of the population thought exactly like him.
Democracy, insinuated - is more ominously, would enable him to "eliminate" (it does not dwell on the exact meaning of this term) the population opposed to his ideas.
In private Democrats democracies, it is even more complicated to discuss "human rights" than procedural formalities because these rights are not considered "rights" in the legal sense, but merely as access consciousness or as gifts to exchange for another valuable asset.
This distinction is particularly important because it draws attention to the limited effectiveness of official legal standards as a means of promoting human rights.
This gap between human rights and the behavior of leaders has led to the biggest change ever occurred in the conduct of international affairs of our time: the advent of "humanitarian intervention."
This change was originally produced outside of established international institutions and the UN system by taking its origin from the French group Doctors Without Borders who considered that human rights were a greater value than national sovereignty.
Doctors Without Borders introduced the concept of the "right of intervention" in humanitarian disasters, bypassing the restrictions of traditional international law.
The international system has also quickly adopted (and transformed) this notion and several humanitarian interventions.
The NATO intervention in Kosovo is a precedent that US Secretary of State Colin Powell has used to justify the war with Iraq.
But so convincing that the cause of a military humanitarian intervention, such actions must be undertaken under the auspices of the UN Charter.
After all, the promotion of human rights has been the guiding principle for the establishment of the UN.
His task in this area has been proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and the Helsinki Accords of 1975, which granted the human rights legal supremacy over the sovereignty of individual states.
But there is a contradiction between the universality and supremacy of human rights and the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of states, which are also part of UN documents.
One way to overcome this contradiction is to introduce into the UN Charter a new chapter devoted to human rights and to reformulate Chapter IV, concerning the use of force in international relations.
The principle of sovereignty must also be redefined in him - even.
The world needs a system of legal orders (bilateral and multilateral agreements, appropriate control and monitoring institutions) to regulate the use of force for humanitarian reasons.
Legal restrictions on humanitarian intervention are necessary because dictators too often use it to justify criminal aggression.
Adolf Hitler developed his strategy when he dismantled Czechoslovakia, so - called to defend the Sudeten Germans, and later when he invaded my homeland, Poland.
As Milosevic showed again in the 1990s, when he claimed to defend the innocent Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia, justifying military intervention solely on the basis of moral principles leaves too much space to distort these principles and abuse.
That is why the debate on the reform of the Security Council should focus not on changing its composition, but on its mission.
The Council should be made explicitly responsible for "human security" and its protection, in addition to his current role in safeguarding more traditional notions of international security.
The principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of a state was never absolute, and globalization confronts this principle with a radical challenge.
The term "international relations" assumes the Westphalian order of commitments among sovereign nations, which replaced the medieval order of communities defined by personal allegiance to a king.
But the Westphalian order is now in decline, and the significance of state borders.
In this wider and uncertain context, the need to regulate military humanitarian intervention threat.
What is America?
When the leaders of the richest nations of the world will gather in Evian, France, an unanswered question will dominate the front of the stage: that America wants in the world?
It may be useful at this point to highlight the principles and ideas that guide US foreign policy.
First, the inconsistency is not a vice.
Indeed, in foreign policy, inconsistency is often a virtue.
I speak not of principles, but of policy.
The United - States do not observe an approach "one size fits all" to the world.
What happened in Iraq should not be over-interpreted as a rigid model of the US policy toward countries that use weapons of mass destruction, supporting terrorism or deny freedom to their citizens.
In Iraq, the United - States used force as a last resort against a country with a long history of assault, and after that a strong international consensus is developed on the actions to be undertaken by Iraq.
Different policies, tailored to local, regional and international realities, should be implemented to meet the challenges posed by North Korea, Iran, Syria, and other countries.
US military forces are an essential part of most of the actions taken by the United - States and internationally.
But defense policy is only one component of foreign policy.
All threats against the national interests of America can not be resolved by military force.
As the saying goes, for people who only have a hammer, all problems are shaped nail.
The foreign policy success, as carpentry, must be based on appropriate tools for the job.
The partnership with other countries plays a key role at this stage.
Despite all US power, there is not much - something that the United - States can accomplish in the world they could not do better with the active participation of others (governments, international organizations and non-governmental organizations) .
The partnership facilitates finding solutions to problems that are opposed to purely national responses and implies burden-sharing.
America relies on partnerships in the global war against terrorism. Foreign governments provide intelligence and law enforcement; trading partners ensure the safety of shipping containers; private financial institutions are keeping track remittances that support terrorist networks.
In - Beyond partnerships, international institutions prove very helpful, provided they are effectively organized, have realistic mandates and their members are committed to standards and common goals.
These institutions can and often do advance national interests of the United - States.
Indeed, it would be rather difficult to achieve the critical dimensions of US foreign policy (trade to non-proliferation to the policies on the environment) without those interests.
The World Trade Organization is a typical example.
It provides a forum for negotiation of new trade liberalization agreements, seek remedies against protectionist and discriminatory policies and resolves conflicts with trading partners.
But the United - States must also ensure that existing institutions are adapted to current realities.
NATO, for example, changing from a Cold War alliance focused solely on Europe to an organization adapted to meet current security challenges regardless of where they arise, as in Afghanistan and can - be in Iraq .
Multilateralism is more successful when it is based on a real convergence of interests and values.
The UN and other global structures can sometimes be best placed to deal with the foreign policy goals of the United - States.
When the UN or other organizations are reluctant or powerless to stand against the sinister threats, America reserves the right to act in less encompassing alliances or flexible coalitions.
This flexibility is an asset of great importance because of the nature of the challenges that loom on the horizon.
We do not know the states that are drifting at our peril, because anarchy creates an environment conducive to extremist ideologies and can even provide a safe haven for terrorists, criminals and drug traffickers.
One of our most urgent tasks today is to prevent the implosion of weak states.
Another focuses on assisting countries that have descended into violence to help them slow to recover.
One of the impulses that govern the international commitment of America (and one of the main sources of its global power) is its desire to make the world better.
Any US foreign policy must combine interests and values, because the American public always insists that US national objectives be linked to national ideals.
The appeal of US leadership abroad rests in part on the appeal of political institutions, society and American culture, as well as his enthusiasm to defend human rights and democracy.
At the same time, our efforts to promote democracy worldwide serve US interests with the objective recognition that democracies settle their differences peacefully.
The world today has no irreconcilable conflict between the main concentrations of world power: Europe, Russia, China, Japan and the United - States.
This conformity of interest and agree on the rules of international order offers a promising basis for the management of common challenges we all face.
Our first objective should be to create a world in which governments, organizations and peoples will accept arrangements that will allow them to realize their shared interests and that reflect fundamental universal values.
We all have an interest in living in a world in which force is used only as a last resort, where terrorism is considered inadmissible, weapons of mass destruction do not spread and are not used, the free - exchange becomes the norm, citizens taste fundamental freedoms, democratic values ‚Äã‚Äãtriumph and law replaces firearms.
Create an integrated world can seem so optimistic, even idealistic, but rarely naive.
The route to the double helix structure of DNA.
Fifty years ago, April 25, 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick published a short letter in the science magazine.
The second major breakthrough took place a few months later, when Max Perutz discovered a technique to determine the structures of large molecules like myoglobin and hemoglobin.
Since then, X-ray structural analysis of protein molecules has allowed us to understand the chemistry of biological reactions.
These two discoveries (the structure of DNA and protein structure) were born in the Cavendish Laboratory of Cambridge University.
So why these two memorial stones of the revolution in biology and medicine that dominated science in the second half of 20.
The major breakthroughs in 1953 were based on experimental physics as practiced in Cambridge since the late 19th century.
This legacy shaped the intellectual environment in which the father was formed team - composed son of William and Lawrence Bragg and in which Lawrence Bragg, first as a student and then as a research student, developed in 1912 the ideas leading to Structural analysis by X-ray.
Although Max von Laue, Walter Friedrich and Paul Knipping have discovered the X-ray diffraction by crystals, it was Lawrence Bragg who discovered a way to scientifically exploit this discovery.
Reflection by the "Bragg planes" sheets of atoms capable of diffracting X-rays to specific angles determined by the separation between the sheets, allowed to calculate the exact Bragg arrangement of atoms of sodium and chloride in a crystal salt.
William Bragg earned a degree in mathematics at Cambridge in 1884 and became professor of physics at Adelaide, Australia.
In 1909 he returned to England to take up a chair at Leeds, continuing his work on the nature of X-rays ..
He became director of the Royal Institution in London in 1923, where he attracted some outstanding young scientists interested in the X-ray ..
Among them were two graduates of Cambridge, William Astbury and John Desmond Bernal, who became interested in the problem of protein structure, Astbury on the request Bragg to provide X-ray diagrams of wool and silk.
Bernal returned to Cambridge as a structural crystallography professor in 1927 and was promoted to the post of Assistant crystallography research director in 1923, at that time under - Cavendish Laboratory department.
Bernal first interested in the atomic structure of the crystals, metals and minerals and hormones and sterols, and certain amino acids, the components of proteins.
Between - time Astbury established himself at Leeds in 1928, where he also began working on amino acids and proteins.
Describing his unsuccessful attempts to obtain X-ray diffraction patterns from well-ordered crystals of the protein pepsin, he wondered whether Bernal could help obtain crystals of other proteins.
A friend of Bernal, Glenn Millikan came to visit a lab in Uppsala, Sweden, where researchers were able to obtain large pepsin crystals, reported some of these crystals, still in their mother liquor, Cambridge.
Bernal and Dorothy Crowfoot (Hodgkin after marriage) obtained dry crystals patterns, as Astbury, with similarly disappointing results.
But when Bernal observed the crystals in a light microscope, he noted that when the large amount of water in the crystal lattice evaporated, the order in crystals was upset.
They repeated the experiment with X-rays, but with the crystal surrounded by its mother liquor and sealed in a glass capillary, obtaining patterns with multiple crystal reflections.
The results of this first moment of protein crystallography definition were published as a letter in the magazine.
Max Perutz, who graduated in chemistry in Vienna, joined Cambridge in 1935 to work as a graduate student with Bernal.
The following year, he received excellent hemoglobin crystals and soon produced the best X-ray diffraction patterns to date.
But the observable diffraction pattern (the intensities and positions of the individual reflections) represents only half of the data required to derive the object of the diffraction structure.
In mathematical terms, this scheme gives the amplitude, but not the phases (ie, stages of oscillatory motion) without which it is impossible to determine the atomic positions.
With simpler structures composed of a lower number of atoms, chemistry could provide vital information on the atomic arrangements and a solution could then be found by trial and error.
But proteins, which contain thousands of atoms, were far too complicated for this to work.
Thus, despite the impressive number of excellent data collected, the solution remained woefully out of reach.
But faith in obtaining detailed information on the protein structure from X-ray patterns remained, but only if this information could be found.
It was therefore natural that where chemistry failed, physics, and its first laboratory, showing the way, a path taken by Watson and Crick in the epic discovery capital as we celebrate this month - one.
Separate Worlds.
Macroeconomic policies, financial globalization and changes in labor market institutions have exacerbated inequality in recent years, not only in terms of income and wealth, but also in terms of access to education, health, social protection, as well as in political participation and influence.
Even in countries experiencing rapid economic growth, an array of factors, exacerbated by tremendous demographic changes, has resulted in the transmission of inequality of knowledge, social responsibilities and opportunities from one generation to another.
As the United Nations with the Social Situation Report in the world 2005: the crisis of inequality, few countries, rich or poor, have proved immune to the global trend of rising inequality or its impact on education, health and social welfare.
There is of course no relationship of simple cause and effect linking poverty and inequality to violence.
But inequality and a sense of deprivation do contribute to resentment and social instability, threatening security.
Excluded and with only dim future prospects, young people, in particular, often experience anomie and some took refuge in anti-social behavior, including violence.
Nor is there a simple explanation of the causes of poverty.
It is clear, however, that poverty arises from various complex conditions, and its improvement requires a multidimensional approach.
It is hard to imagine, for example, how to "make poverty in the dustbin of history" (Make Poverty History) without also generating enough decent work, educational and health opportunities for all.
It is certain that the world has seen some progress in many areas in recent decades.
Access to education for girls has improved and some differences due to gender gaps have been reduced.
Despite AIDS and the resurgence of malaria and tuberculosis, life expectancy has risen almost everywhere in the world thanks to the improvement of public health systems.
Overall, however, the inequality gaps are large and, in some cases it is even expanding.
The most important determinant in income inequality today is still wealth inequality, with the increasing concentration of asset ownership in recent years principally responsible for greater income inequality in most countries .
Meanwhile, growing unemployment, widening skill and productivity gaps, and the "de - formalization" and "de - Methodology", which hit the labor markets have exacerbated income inequality in the world whole, the number of "working poor" and the incidence of "growth in the number of unemployed" have increased.
No more than the stabilization and structural adjustment programs, imposed since the 1980s, have truly fulfilled their higher economic growth promises.
Growth almost everywhere over the twenty-five recent years has shown that in the lower twenty - five years, despite the rapid growth in East Asia, India and some other countries.
Such growth differences suggest that overall global inequality may have - be not increased unequivocally.
But inequalities at the national level have deepened in most countries in recent years, largely due to economic liberalization at both the national and international levels.
Indeed, in many parts of the world, such economic reforms have actually undermined growth rates as well as the initiator role of government, while otherwise increasing overall inequalities.
The few exceptions are usually due to continued or government interventions.
But these are exceptions: the cumulative impact of these reforms over the past 25 years has produced greater inequality in most developed and developing countries, with rising unemployment, greater earnings disparities, reducing social protections and environmental degradation.
The liberalization of the international financial sector, for example, has undermined the use of more inclusive development grants and targeted to promote economic activities.
Moreover, contrary to the promises of its proponents, financial liberalization has actually resulted in net capital flows from those who had the least to those who had the most to long term, while increasing financial volatility and weakening economic activity.
Meanwhile, negotiations on free trade seem to ignore historical trends.
The conditions of international trade in developing countries have deteriorated: the price of commodities have declined in relation to manufactures, as the prices of tropical agricultural products relative to the prices of agricultural products from temperate countries, and generic prices have fallen as a result of production protected by the laws on intellectual property.
Thus, trade liberalization of manufactures has resulted in de-industrialization and greater unemployment in most parts of the world, as shown in the case of textiles this year.
And, while agricultural trade liberalization may enhance export earnings for some poor countries, the main beneficiaries will be the richest agricultural exporters.
Countries that import currently subsidized food will suffer.
The "retreat of the state" which assists much of the developed world has recently involved a generally reduced role for the state, including its ability to lead and support the development and its social interventions in public education, health, housing and utilities.
Economic liberalization implementation in many countries over the last 25 years was, from the beginning, a questionable policy and its consequences have become glaringly obvious.
If the world does not focus on economic policies able to address the negative impact of economic inequality on growth and reduction of poverty, the poor and the privileged will continue to live in separate worlds.
We must not follow the Federal Reserve.
The Fed States - United faced a dilemma because it must continue to raise rates compared to an economy devastated by Hurricane Katrina.
The inability of the Reserve to raise rates earlier thus holds a lesson for the European Central Bank: after a prolonged period of monetary stability at unusually low interest rates, waiting too long to raise rates to more normal levels and Suitable contains dangerous consequences.
The Fed was late in beginning the rate normalization process and is now paying the price.
The ECB must not make the same mistake, even if we consider that the two central banks operate in different environments and with different constraints.
Warning signs - of impending inflation abound across the euro zone.
The growth of the money supply is well above target levels for some time, indicating excess liquidity.
Headline inflation in September to 2.6%, is higher than the 2% target of the ECB, as are recent forecasts for inflation in 2006 (revised and corrected forecasts will be published in early December).
"The key wage moderation period may - be ending" warns Otmar Issing, the chief economist of the ECB, by - implying that energy prices skyrocketing may - now be powered via the level general price (also called side effects).
In these circumstances, there is no good reason to wait before to raise interest rates.
The more energy prices remain at their high levels of today, the greater the probability that the expected inflation increases and side effects will be realized.
Further procrastination on the normalization of policy rates by the ECB could well lead to a nasty bout of inflation.
This would be disastrous for Europe and the economic recovery since the ECB would have no choice but to weigh hard on the monetary brakes.
Nobody really wants.
Better is an increase on the basis of 50 points now allowing the economic recovery to continue by keeping inflation, an increase three to four times higher than the figure later.
The old adage "prevention is better than cure" is especially true in the case of monetary policy.
If we judge by the outcome of the meeting last month of the Governing Council of the ECB, this "prevention" approach seems fast to the economy of the euro area.
Indeed, the pace of ECB warnings about the risks of inflation has accelerated in recent months, and what was a "Let's be vigilant" became a "Let's be very vigilant" in September before turn into "Increased vigilance needed about the high risks vis - a - vis price stability" in October.
The Governing Council takes the risk of run out of adjectives, and credibility if it does not act soon.
The tone of comments from ECB President Jean - Claude Trichet, during the session of questions and answers that took place in the press conference following the meeting of October was particularly warlike.
Trichet seemed to appeal to a pre-emptive approach when he said, "we must not allow second-round effects to materialize".
For the first time, the ECB president was willing to admit that the Governing Council had discussed the pros and cons of a rate hike during their meeting.
Nonetheless, current interest rates were described as "still relevant" in October, signaling that the ECB has not yet made the decision to spend.
It is certain that the unexpected slowdown in economic activity or a strong increase in the value of the euro could postpone the inevitable rate increase.
But what seems clear is that if the ECB used the October press conference to warn politicians, trade unions and the markets that its long period of inactivity for monetary policy coming to an end.
The end of the process is running.
This news did not delight everyone.
Political leaders, including Jacques Chirac in France, Silvio Berlusconi in Italy and ECOFIN (the finance ministers of the Member States of the European Union), continue to press for fixed, even lower and lower rates.
But it is easy for politicians to be irresponsible when it comes to monetary policy.
It is not they who are stigmatized when prices rise, nor do they have to push the inflation genie in the bottle.
By constantly pushing for lower rates higher than the ECB can deliver, politicians make the ECB the scapegoat for poor economic performance of Europe.
Europe goes wrong, say - they, not because of their own failure to lead the structural reforms, but because the rates are too high.
At the same time, the ECB does not need to go as far as the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates in increments of 25 basis points for 12 consecutive meetings, with additional increases are expected.
For the ECB, an increase of 50 basis points could do at this point, and rates could be on hold for some time.
The Fed waited too long to start the normalization process, and thus was more aggressive in lowering rates in the downward phase of the cycle of interest rate, it had to be more aggressive in raising them in the upward phase.
This is not the type of volatile monetary policy that Europe wants or she needs.
The West against the rest of the world?
The bombings in Madrid led to the gates of Europe the scourge of terrorism.
March 11 is now the European version of the US on September 11.
But America and Europe often do not seem to see the world through the same eyes: Spain's response to terrorist attacks, a threat that affects all democracies, was to elect a government promising to end pro-US policy in Iraq.
Must - so we understand that Europe and the United - States dramatically different visions?
The apparent division on foreign policy is partly explained by a misunderstanding of the nature of "Europe."
The European project is a realistic response to globalization and its challenges.
It was launched to create "de facto solidarity" promote political stability and consolidating democracy and the social model of Europe.
Having achieved these goals, Europe now wants to make a positive contribution to the developments of the world.
It is not a question here of nostalgia for past glory.
An unprecedented degree of solidarity now across Europe, manifested for example in the collective mourning and outpouring of sympathy towards Spain; we must build on that huge potential to create a logic of solidarity in the world.
The United - States, also victims of a horrific attack, are attracted to the world, without going to promote a similar model of cooperation.
In defending their values ‚Äã‚Äãand security, Americans strive instead to defend the world, especially the Western world, new dark threats.
The messianic idealism that issued Europe from Nazism and protected Western Europe from communism is now directed at other enemies.
All the attention being paid to strained transatlantic relations, it is easy to forget that our concerns often overlap.
On issues such as terrorism, weapons proliferation, Iran, Afghanistan (country we jointly train the country's future army), and Africa (where French initiatives and American support recently allowed stabilize the Ivory Coast and Congo), Europe and the United - States speak with one voice.
But on some issues, such as the Iraq war, Europeans are not all ready to follow America blindly.
The world, and Europe in particular, is experiencing the fascination and admiration for the United - States.
But today, we must eliminate any feelings of fascination and gratitude and realize that the pursuit of European integration is in the interests of the United - States, who supported him for 50 years.
In today's world, there is enough to do for two to bring stability and security, and to promote common values.
In particular, the "engine" Franco - German Europe should not be considered as a potential rival for the United - States.
France and Germany are not an axis aspiring to become a kind of alternative leadership in the United - States.
The two countries rather a laboratory needed EU internal operation.
Anyone who thinks that we produce a European rival to America has not properly considered the facts.
Indeed, France and Germany do not get along naturally.
Many points separate: the enlargement of the EU, agriculture and domestic market.
So it is not.
This is all that I do not believe in an imminent sustainable rupture.
The majority of Americans still see in Europe a partner largely the same objectives in the world.
Most Europeans see in America a strong friend.
We are all allies of the United - States; our growth strategy and our contribution to global stability depend on the irreplaceable nature of our relationship with America.
That is why the United - States should encourage the development of a common European security and defense policy, which is simply the burden sharing that America has imposed on Europe for decades.
We must forge greater European military capabilities in order to put in place a mechanism allowing us to move effectively shoulder to shoulder when terrorism or other catastrophes strike one of our democracies, as has just happened.
But we must also build capacity for autonomous European military planning because the EU might need to lead its own operations, can - perhaps because NATO is reluctant about it.
We, the French, are opposed to the establishment of a European "two-speed".
But we want structured co-operation (that is - to - say that some European countries may lead to the establishment of a defense capacity) because we are not prepared to let the more cautious and hesitant most of us repeat the tragedy of the Balkans in the 1990s, when Europeans could not act and Americans did not want it (for a while).
The creation of such a capacity would make the EU a more effective transatlantic partner.
This makes it difficult for Europeans to understand why plans for closer European integration are considered anti - American.
The only way to remove these fears is to establish a closer and more frequent dialogue.
On issues of defense and security, the EU's security doctrine provides a great opportunity to strengthen our common concerns: terrorism and non-proliferation, but also the need to ensure sustainable development in all regions of the world.
Europe and the United - States should continue their cooperation objectives while ensuring that such cooperation never becomes an alliance of the "West against the rest of the world."
Some Western countries have attempted to create a "clash of civilizations" based on our troubled times.
Our task is to find a way to stand together without standing against a particular country.
India is - she ready to completely convert its currency?
It is likely that political courage shown by India in its search for peace with Pakistan to end their confrontation nebulous half - century to conquer Kashmir is matched by equally economic initiatives bold.
Indeed, India is edging toward a truly bold reform: full international convertibility of the rupee.
Convertibility will not only affect the economic development of India, but give an object lesson to China, which ponders convertibility in the years ahead.
Since 1991, India is between the devaluation of the rupee and full convertibility, the Reserve Bank of India (BRI) more relaxing exchange controls.
Indian residents can now have a foreign currency account and invest in shares of foreign companies, while non-resident Indians can repatriate legacy / inheritance assets.
Indian companies listed on foreign exchanges may acquire real property in foreign countries and resident companies are entitled to prepay external commercial debt up to $ 100 million.
The limits placed on the foreign currency accounts of exporters are deleted and the banks can invest in the capital markets and monetary Also - Wed.
India is - Subscribe to full convertibility?
The government is still lagging in terms of national economic reforms.
Structural reform and privatization have slowed, undermining investor confidence.
But this failure to address structural problems could expose the economy to external shocks in the long term.
It would be premature as India opens its capital account immediately.
The stability of the exchange rate is the major anchor when the reform process of a country began.
However, it remains unlikely that the convertibility of the capital account has a significant impact on the growth rate of a country.
With the convertibility of the capital account, the exchange rate of the rupee will be determined more by capital flows than by inflation differentials, as the inflation rate in India is more or less than average 3% of the OECD.
Since India is still in deficit, the rupee could come under pressure following a negative shock.
Although monetary growth is more than double the real GDP growth rate, the inflationary risk is probably low because substantial excess capacity.
Indeed, the 1990s, despite an overall yield rising, have experienced a significant deflation implies that the overall yield potential in India is growing.
The steps towards full convertibility of the capital account continued in tune with the impressive growth of foreign exchange reserves of India.
Indeed, foreign exchange availability from India have increased significantly during the last decade.
Following a capital account surplus and an interest rate differential of 3-4%, foreign reserves reached $ 70.3 billion in late 2002, enough to cover 15 months of imports, against only $ 4 billion in 1990.
Following the crisis of the balance of payments in 1991, the exchange rate of the rupee was devalued by 20%.
Exporters could exchange 30% of their income to market conditions.
This method has subsequently been replaced by a dual exchange rate system, which made the partially convertible rupee (60% of revenues derived from exports could be translated at the foreign exchange market and the remainder at a fixed rate of RBI used by the government to finance essential imports like petroleum, cooking oil, fertilizers and saving drugs).
The dual exchange rate system acted as an export tax on, but he did not survive long, giving way to a course of unified exchange in trade.
The full current account convertibility followed in August 1994.
The policy debate then turned to capital account convertibility, strongly encouraged by the IMF and the World Bank.
In May 1997, the Tarapore Committee on Capital Account Convertibility developed a liberalization process in three steps by 1999 to 2000, with an emphasis on fiscal consolidation, an inflation rate target and allowed a sound financial system.
The East Asian currency crisis then put the planned actions on hold and raised serious questions about the date of the recovery actions and the need to continue convertibility.
The sudden fusion of apparently healthy economies bluntly reminded that full convertibility is not expected to result from strong external liquidity.
After all, the liberalization of the capital account may result in volatility in the exchange rate and even countries which are important in foreign currencies could not prevent a run on their reserves.
India must retain the following lesson: if national or external shock, full convertibility could prove to be an expensive and short-lived experience.
The fundamental question is whether full convertibility will encourage inflow or net outflow of capital.
The risk of more instability for the rupee is aggravated by serious problems, including a deficit amounting to 6% of GNP and the impasse with Pakistan.
The short-term capital outflows, which may occur if one of these two risks getting worse, could make even more unstable overall performance.
It is therefore vital that India increases capital inflows over the long term, the capital account is closed or open.
In this context, it is noteworthy that China, whose capital account is closed, has foreign exchange reserves amounting to $ 286 billion, four times those of India, although China's economy do so only twice that of India.
The full convertibility is not the solution either to attract direct investment (FDI) more important.
China attracted FDI of 52.7 billion dollars in 2002, namely the return of the most important capital in the world.
India needs FDI more important to absorb the excess capacity of its economy.
This underlines the importance of successful management of the capital account (monitoring inflows and outflows) to India after a first step towards full convertibility.
But in the short term, full capital account convertibility is not in the interest of India.
Twilight of the Chancellor?
The resignation of Chancellor Gerhard Schreder as president of the Democratic Party of Germany socio profoundly affect the distribution of forces within the German government and its slim majority "red green" in Parliament.
Although it seems premature to talk, as some in Germany, "Twilight of the Chancellor" or qualify the surprising decision of Schreder "beginning of the end" of his position, it is perfectly appropriate to describe it as a consequent loss of power.
The immediate winner is Franz Mentefering, 64, leader of the parliamentary arena of the SPD, who will succeed Schreder as president of the party.
Both politicians will constitute a tandem, but Schreder depend more on the loyalty of Mentefering Mentefering that depend on the success of Schreder.
Schreder is a flat - shape and moderate left political program, similar to the philosophy of the New Labour British Prime Minister Tony Blair or centrism of former US President Bill Clinton.
Mentefering however, is more attached to the traditional values ‚Äã‚Äãof the Democratic social party (or Old Labour).
In terms of leadership style, Schreder plays solo Mentefering team.
In Germany, Chancellor occupies the highest position among the main political actors.
The main source of the strength of the German Chancellor, lies not within the statutory powers conferred on him by the constitution, but in the real support that meets in his own party.
With one notable exception in the 1950s, none of the two main parties of Germany policies (Social Democrats and moderately conservative Christian Democrats) never managed to obtain an absolute majority in parliament.
As a result, German Chancellors usually preside coalition governments and true authority is based on the loyalty of the party forces they command in these political alliances.
Although the Social Democrats have never really appreciated Schreder (they certainly did not appreciate as much as the unforgettable Willy Brandt), they followed nilly as they saw it as the only guarantor of electoral success after 16 frustrating years (1982-1998) in opposition to Helmut Kohl.
But things have changed.
Since late 2002, Schreder and the SPD found themselves faced with unusually low voter approval rate and this situation is unlikely to change the situation.
In 2003 alone, about 40,000 Social Democrats left their party, an unprecedented hemorrhage.
If national elections were held on Sunday, February 8, a center-right coalition of Christian Democrats and Liberals would have won 57% of the vote, according to Infratest dimap, a leading German research institutes.
With maximum of 35% of the vote, the coalition "Red Green" Schreder would have run to ruin.
At the beginning of what has been dubbed a "super election year" in Germany (14 elections a European level, five at the regional level and eight at the local level), it was a disaster for the new SPD.
On several occasions, Schreder had been extremely encouraged by desperate situations when found himself back against the wall.
This quality is his greatest strength, and it appears that it is being launched in the against - the riskiest offensive either.
It is based on the following bet: a substantial economic improvement will occur from the second half of 2004 until the next national elections in autumn 2006 and the voters will attribute the expected recovery to the reforms of the economy, the labor market and the welfare state, called "Agenda 2010", which Schreder had the spearhead of his chancery.
For years, the reformist rhetoric Schreder did not correspond to its policies.
It was only after his reelection in the fall of 2002 he abandoned his old populist stance, short-term responses and neo methods - to convince corporatist unions and employers' associations.
Given the pressing problems of Germany (population decline is accelerating, an over-regulated labor market and an obscure and confusing tax system), the Schreder reform program may seem too timid, but many cuts were perceived as extremely cruel by the largest constituency of the SPD, particularly by powerful unions.
But, given the economic distress of Germany, which is expected to worsen following the demographic problems of the country, the Social Democrats are now condemned to give wealth creation in favor of redistribution.
Germany can not afford to idle or worse yet, stop the reform process.
In the best case, Schreder remain true to the philosophy "Agenda 2010" and Mentefering patiently explain to a reluctant SPD that they will cross the desert before reaching the Promised Land.
In the worst case, Schreder return to populism to win a short-term electoral victory and Mentefering confirm this choice to avoid the hurt democratic socio ¬¢ to me to sink into absolute despair.
Schreder's tragedy is that his power could further collapse, whatever path he chooses.
At the end of this "super election year," we know the answer.
Syndrome great man.
In this era of globalization, there are vast impersonal forces are supposed to determine the course of events.
The globalization of markets, unfettered trade, militant Islam, China's awakening: these are the things historians and strategists usually portray as the key forces shaping our destiny.
Yet for the most part, we do not see it that way.
Most people still instinctively seek the "great men" to historical figures, men (and women) who seem to forge events through their political vision, personal charisma and force of their moral.
By sheer force of conviction and personality, such figures, many believe - we can get things done while providing a glimmer of hope to an otherwise detached and impersonal universe.
This yearning for providential men or women in our global age results from three factors.
First, there is the complexity and vulnerability of our world.
Second, paradoxically, it is our growing cynicism towards politics and politicians.
Finally, it is the result of our media culture, obsessed as it is with putting a "face" on events.
Faced with the problem of bringing about positive changes in a domestic or international environment that seems to defy the power of leaders "ordinary", it turns to new Alexanders to untie the "knot Gordian" and transcend complexity by sheer force of will and dynamism.
Structural reforms in Europe, for example, are considered as impossible to implement unless imposed by some reincarnation of Margaret Thatcher.
Middle - East, everyone waits for a new Anwar Sadat in the Arab world.
The disillusionment - √† - vis politics and politicians also is a key element of our yearning for providential leaders.
In France, for example, the overly flattering commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the death of Fran√ßois Mitterrand primarily reflects widespread disillusion with regard to his successor, Jacques Chirac.
Indirect criticism of the present is often a key element in idealized views of the past.
The less we expect a politician "ordinary", the more we look for a hero.
With the world becoming a global stage, the media's role in fueling the appetite for providential leaders is essential.
The public demands quick answers to complex problems that, if unsolved, risk endangering the planet.
They need figures with whom they can identify, it can immediately recognize and, above all, that he may give her confidence.
The emergence of a "global civil society" heightens demand embryonic universal and charismatic figures, a global accountability hope populist overtones.
In a world searching for providential leaders, the case of Ariel Sharon is both symbolic and paradoxical, for this universal man remains one of the most controversial figures of recent decades.
He became an almost revered figure in his country and Western public opinion believe that his political demise represents a blow that could be fatal for any hope of progress in the region, even as he remains hated in many parts of Arab and Muslim world.
The transformation of Mr. Sharon, the villain to hero within the space of a few years is a source of fascination for his people, the region and the world, especially as his ultimate intentions will remain a subject of endless discussions among future historians and politicians who claim to be his faithful heirs today.
Sharon has really convinced by demographers that the "Great Israel" that once seemed to be his dream would actually mean the end of the Jewish state, or did his disengagement strategy focused on "Gaza first" meant - it genuinely "Gaza only"?
For those who support one or the other reading, Sharon will forever hold the benefit of the doubt.
That we have been able to compare the attack suffered by Sharon in terms of political consequences the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin demonstrates his personality is associated with hope and security.
The "bulldozer" became the great - grandfather of most Israelis and the last card of Western diplomacy, for Americans and, surprisingly, for Europeans, too.
He alone seemed to incarnate the combination of reassuring strength and vision to carry the majority of Israelis behind him in a process of unilateral disengagement.
In fact, one might wonder if the world has made of Sharon a providential man because he wanted to believe in all that there was still a possibility of hope in the Middle - East.
Was - it wishful thinking or self-fulfilling prophecy?
We will never know.
What is certain is that the vacuum created by the departure of Mr Sharon's political life is all the more striking in light of the images of chaos emerging from Gaza since Israel's withdrawal and the collapse our eyes of the Palestinian Authority.
Nor will the emergence of another providential figure come easily.
Not all exceptional periods create their Bonapartes, which is probably best, for exceptional leaders may give the illusion that all problems have their solution, which is far from true.
The natural course of history in the most optimistic sense is progress "at the edge" but the rapid pace of technological change is pushing us to expect equally rapid progress in human affairs.
Many of us believe that such an impossible wager can be fulfilled only by a providential man, with all the hopes and dangers it represents.
The UN fall.
The reign of terror of Saddam Hussein takes its end.
His Ba'athist government, however, not only will flow.
Ironically, the United Nations will sink with it.
It is possible that the UN will not disappear entirely.
The areas dedicated to "good works" (ie, bureaucracies for the maintenance of peace, or low-risk those who fight against AIDS and malaria and to defend the rights of the child) will continue.
The chatterbox occurring in the East River in New York continue to whine.
The reluctance of the Security Council to endorse the use of force to enforce its own resolutions on Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction was the death knell of the old fantasy of decades which saw the UN as the foundation of the world order.
While we reject the debris of the war to liberate Iraq, it is important to preserve, through international law administered by international institutions, the intellectual wreckage of the liberal concept of security to better understand them.
As free Iraqis describe the nightmare of Saddam's reign, which lasted a quarter of a century, we must not forget what those who supported this war and those who have not supported those who said that moral authority of the international community was enshrined in pleas for additional time for UN inspectors and those who demonstrated against the "regime change".
In the spirit of reconciliation post - war that diplomats still absolutely want to promote, we must not resign ourselves to the timid outdated notion that world order requires us to recoil before rogue states that terrorize their citizens and threaten ours.
Decent, thoughtful and full of principles, millions who demonstrated against the resolution to account Iraq were catalyzed by the idea that only the UN Security Council had the necessary authority to legitimize the use of force.
A voluntary coalition of liberal democracies willing to send their soldiers to block the road to evil is not enough.
No matter that these troops are used to enforce UN demands.
If a country or coalition of countries other than the United Nations Security Council made use of force, even as a last resort, "anarchy", not international law, would prevail, destroying any hope of world order.
It is believed that the protesters.
But this idea is dangerously wrong and leads inexorably to justify morally (and even to justify decisions politico - military existential) of countries like Syria, Cameroon, Angola, Russia, China and France.
If a policy is right when the Security Council approves, how - it be wrong just because communist China, Russia, France and a host of secondary dictatorships withhold their approval?
Those who opposed the actions of the coalition in Iraq usually respond that "order" must have primacy over "anarchy."
But - correct?
The UN Security Council represents the most competent institution for ensuring order and saving us from anarchy?
History suggests otherwise.
The United Nations was born from the ashes of a war that the League of Nations proved unable to prevent.
The League was simply not ready to face Italy in Abyssinia, much less had it survived that debacle, to fight against Nazi Germany.
In the euphoria that followed the victory in the Second World War, the hope of making collective security was placed in the hands of the UN Security Council for many poor results.
During the Cold War, the Security Council turned completely paralyzed.
Indeed, the decision to defend South Korea against the attacks against her in 1950 was taken by the Council only because Stalin ordered his diplomats to boycott the sessions of the UN, which meant that no Soviet ambassador was present to exercise his veto.
It was a mistake that the Soviets not commit.
In 1967 and 1973, the UN withdrew from the Middle - East, leaving Israel to defend itself on its own.
The Soviet empire was grounded and Eastern Europe liberated, not by the UN but by the mother of all coalitions, NATO.
Faced with multiple attacks Milosevic, the UN failed to stop the Balkan wars or even protect its victims.
You remember Sarajevo?
Srebrenica and the massacre of thousands of Muslims under the false protection of the UN?
It was necessary that the willing form a coalition to save Bosnia from extinction.
Once the war ended, peace was made in Dayton, Ohio, not the UN.
The rescue of Muslims in Kosovo was not due to the UN: their cause never received the approval of the Security Council.
This century now challenges the hopes for a new world order on new plans.
We shall overcome nor even contiendrons fanatical terror if we do not bring the war in the territories that trigger.
We will have to be done using force against states that harbor terrorists, as we did to destroy the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.
The most dangerous states are those that possess weapons of mass destruction, chemical, biological and nuclear weapons that can kill not hundreds or thousands, but hundreds of thousands.
Iraq was one of those - there, but there are many others.
Hope to convince them to withdraw their support or asylum they give to terrorists rests on the certainty and effectiveness with which they are confronted.
The chronic failure of the Security Council to enforce its own resolutions regarding Iraq is clear: it is simply not able to fulfill its mission.
We therefore remain only with coalitions of the willing.
Far from disparaging them as a threat to a new world order, we should instead recognize that they are, by default, the best hope left for this order and the true alternative to the anarchy caused by the dismal failure of United Nations.
Neoliberalism, so what?
Twenty years of neoliberal economic policies have brought disappointing results for developing countries.
Latin America, the region with the most tried to set up the recipes of the "Washington Consensus" (free market, price deregulation, privatization), has experienced a weak and volatile growth of widening the gap inequalities.
Among the former socialist economies of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, few have reached the actual production levels achieved before 1990.
In sub - Saharan Africa, most economies have failed to cope with adjustment programs demanded by the IMF and the World Bank.
The few successful examples have occurred in countries that have followed their own pace and do not really represent an idealized image of neoliberalism.
China, Viet - Nam and India: all three have disobeyed almost all the rules of the neoliberal textbook perfect, even when they are engaged in a more focused way to market.
It is now time to abandon neoliberalism and the Washington Consensus.
Remains the challenge of an alternative, a set of policies to promote development without falling into the trap of a new self impractical plane - called planned for the well - being of all countries without distinction.
Experience suggests that an adequate growth program needs to be anchored in two strategies: an investment strategy designed to revive growth in the short term and an institution-building strategy designed to provide a resilient economy in the face of adversity of economic shocks.
The key to investment strategy is to achieve interest to local businessmen to the local economy.
Encourage foreign investment or indulge in the full liberalization and wait until the situation improves is not viable.
An effective strategy must accomplish two goals: to encourage investment in low-traditional areas and pruning projects or investments that do not lead.
For this, governments must use both the carrot than the stick.
Find out what a country produces (or could happen) easily represents the biggest challenge for any economic development.
The core of the policy is necessary because there is much to gain socially if it is discovered, for example, cut flowers, footballs or computer programs can be produced at low cost. Also because this knowledge can guide other entrepreneurs investments.
The businessman who made the first "discovery" can only capture a small part of the social value that this knowledge generates, and quickly, it is followed on this path by others.
Consequently, entrepreneurship of this type (find out what can be produced) is usually under - represented by the lack of commercial incentive.
You must also use the stick policy to ensure that such motivations do not account for unnecessary or unproductive investments.
The implementation of such a strategy may vary from country to country, depending on administrative capacity, the prevailing incentive regime, the flexibility of the tax system, the sophistication of the financial sector and the economy policy under - lying.
Funding programs limited in time, the funding of public enterprises and export financing are some ways to approach this set up, but there are many others.
There is no single way that would work everywhere.
Governments that do not have the capabilities to exercise their leadership role of the private sector are entitled to the disaster and are unlikely to improve the distribution of resources.
This attempt can succeed but economic growth requires more than temporary resuscitation investment and entrepreneurship.
It also requires effort to build four types of institutions required to maintain the advanced growth and building resilience to economic shocks.
Institutions able to build the market (property rights and contract law).
Market regulatory institutions (outsourcing, economies of scale, professional information).
Market stabilization institutions (monetary and fiscal management).
Market legitimizing institutions (social protection and insurance).
Build and strengthen these institutions, however, takes time.
Receive initial period of growth to experiment and innovate on these fronts can be highly fee thereafter.
The bottom line here is that institutional arrangements by necessity are specific to each country.
Find out what works in any country involves some experimentation.
After all, institutions are not able to greenhouse plants replanted beings in any soil in any climate.
Reforms that operate in an environment may be poor or failing in others.
Such specificity helps explain why some countries succeed (China, India, South Korea and Taiwan among others) by combining unorthodox elements with very traditional policies.
It also explains why important institutional differences persist among industrialized countries of North America, Western Europe and Japan in areas such as the role of the public sector, the legal system, corporate governance , financial markets, labor markets and social protection.
While economic analysis can help in making institutional choices, public deliberation and collective choices also have an important role to play.
In fact, public participation in democracies is considered meta - institutions that allow to choose the "menu" of institutional arrangements of each domain.
Designing such a growth strategy is both harder and easier than implementing standard neoliberal policies.
More difficult because the constraints that this imposes on growth are often specific to each country and adapt poorly to standard recipes.
However, more easy because once these constraints clearly objectified, relatively simple policy changes can yield enormous from the economic point of view and open the way to a virtuous circle of growth and institutional reform.
This approach does not mean abandoning the standard economic thinking, far from it.
Neoliberalism is to neoclassical economies what astrology is to astronomy.
In both cases, there must be a well-established faith to go from one to the other.
Critics of neoliberalism should not oppose mainstream economics but only its misuse.
The other central Europe.
A specter is haunting Central Europe as its countries prepare to join the European Union.
This promising development is compromised by a fevered electoral nationalism which seeks to win votes by promising to reopen old wounds and settle old scores.
The most striking example is Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orban demanded the repeal of the decrees issued in 1945 by President Edvard Benes (decrees confiscating the property of German and Hungarian populations deported from Czechoslovakia at that time and they took away their citizenship) as part of a re-election campaign that failed narrowly.
But Orban is not alone in seeing electoral advantage in the evocation of old ghosts memories.
Orban argued that revoking the "Benes decrees" should be a condition for the integration of the Czech Republic (and the Slov√©quie) in the European Union.
Unwillingness inspired by maneuvering Orban has interrupted much of regional cooperation established during the last decade.
Instead, a new form of threatening national populism is emerging across the plain that extends between Bavaria and the Danube.
The chain reaction resulting from the revival of nationalism dangerously alter the political landscape.
Since the election that brought to power a coalition of parties Sch√ºssel and Jorg Haider in Vienna, Austria's relations with the neighboring Czech Republic have deteriorated on two points: the requirement that the Czechs close the central Temelin Nuclear on the Austrian border and revoke the Benes Decrees in which the Sudeten Germans were deported from the Czech Republic and have installed massively in Bavaria but also in Austria.
Once resolved the issue of nuclear power, the populist pressure was channeled into a single channel, the demand for repeal of the Benes Decrees.
Czech Prime Minister Milos Zeman quickly demonstrated that he could also play a demagogic nationalist card.
He described the Sudeten Germans as the "fifth column" of Hitler and suggested that Israel could solve the Palestinian problem by using the Czech method of 1945: namely, deportation.
Edmund Stoiber, the head of government of Bavaria, the candidate of the conservative CDU / CSU for German chancellor against current Chancellor Schroeder, and a staunch defender of the Sudeten Germans demanded that Schroeder cancel a planned visit to Prague answer the explosive reaction Zeman.
To defuse an electoral fight with his rival, Schroeder consent.
The fact Orban has supported the demands of Stoiber was felt like a gift from heaven by Vladimir Meciar Slovak nationalist in his new attempt to become prime minister, because it allowed him to claim that its domestic opponents were preparing to surrender pressure from the European Union and force Slovakia to compensate the Hungarians expelled by Benes in 1945.
Meciar then jumped, denouncing the "Hungarian threat", canceling one stroke four years of hard work with the current Slovak government to include representatives of the Hungarian ethnic minority in the government of Slovakia.
Issues relating to the legal order of Europe in the post - war go far - beyond the former Czechoslovakia.
Erika Steinbach, president of the Association of the deportees (Eastern) and member of the CDU Stoiber, argues that the question of the deportation of German populations affects Poles, Czechs, Slovaks and Slovenes, thus encompassing much of Eastern Europe and Central Europe.
In the 1930s, the bane of some countries in Central Europe was "the Versailles Treaty."
It seems today that the statements made in 1945 that were voting Potsdam and the mass expulsion of the German population are the new enemy.
The current concern is that such demagoguery can cause a cycle of populist victories.
This concern has been started when the Fidesz party of Viktor Orban lost the recent parliamentary elections in Hungary, but other politicians happy to be demagogues national resentments - Vaclav Klaus in Prague, Edmund Stoiber in Germany, Vladimir Meciar in Slovakia - still consider nationalism as an electoral asset despite the defeat of Orban.
Since they are related to the skeptics who oppose the European Union such as Italy and Berlusconi coalition Sch√ºssel - Haider in Austria, the true nature of European politics may become decidedly unpleasant.
Since its inception, the EU has sought to overcome old disputes and, through cooperation, to build a better future.
Today, some politicians want to take advantage of the desire of Eastern Europe to resume historical issues to their political advantage.
This situation suggests two fatal consequences: first, there is no cheaper way to return some parts of public opinion in the candidate countries against the European Union to allow local populists to portray the Union as a dissemination agent of German power.
An extensive European Union must be a way to balance the asymmetrical relationship between the small countries of Eastern Europe and Germany.
It is possible that it is perceived as a sign of this asymmetry.
The second concern is that while NATO and the EU expand, these unpleasant debates contaminate relations within international organizations.
This fear may be one reason why President Bush recently refused to meet with Prime Minister Orban and is frequently question whether Orban had spoken as he does now before the entry of Hungary in the NATO, his country's bid was rejected.
What - what could interrupt this process?
After 1945, Western Europe has undertaken painful debates about history, which contributed to the Franco - German reconciliation.
The concepts of "collective guilt" were dismissed as having no basis in a unified and unifying Europe.
President Vaclav Havel and courageously expressed during his first trip to Germany in January 1990, but his comments were misinterpreted as weakness.
With the approach of the expansion of the European Union, the mission of Europe must not be contaminated by the defenders of the idea that politicians of the old "other" Central Europe prefer to live in the past rather than thinking responsibly to build a peaceful and prosperous Europe.
Bush and Blair should - they resign?
The main consequences of the war in Iraq are not searching the battlefield.
They will manifest later because they depend on the good - the arguments put forward by George Bush and Tony Blair to launch an attack against a largely defenseless population.
These arguments have been passionately debated in the world.
If found justified, war can lead - to be on a safer world.
But if they prove unfounded or can not be verified, the war could lead to further instability.
In this case, not to make matters worse, the US President and the British Prime Minister should resign.
The war was not justified and could be the fact that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant.
The justifications advanced by Bush and Blair are related to the danger posed by Saddam's regime.
They cited four arguments.
Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.
These weapons pose a serious and immediate threat.
UN inspections do not eliminate this threat.
The war was the best way to end the threat.
The first argument used will be the easiest to check.
Bush and Blair talked repeatedly stocks of weapons of mass destruction and mobile units capable of producing and using them, as well as ongoing programs to build nuclear weapons.
They must prove their claim, and they must do so before an international opinion who thinks able to tamper with evidence.
This is why independent experts mandated by the UN should consider the evidence would be found.
No real proof of the existence of weapons of mass destruction with a real threat, Bush and Blair must go - that, whatever the events in Iraq.
The second argument is more difficult to prove.
Bush and Blair must show that the weapons of mass destruction were found they have a serious and immediate threat.
We know that Iraq possessed chemical and biological weapons, because the US sold them to him.
It is therefore not whether there are still traces of these weapons - there's got to stay in storage sites - but there remains sufficient to pose a threat.
If the Iraqis are now using these weapons, it will be proof that they were ready to be used.
It will then determine whether they could be a threat outside Iraq's borders and how Iraq would have used if the current war had not taken place.
The third argument largely ready to controversy.
Bush and Blair should demonstrate that the UN inspections were ineffective.
They can do this by giving evidence that the Iraqis have managed to hide equipment in the sites controlled by the inspectors.
There should be a systematic review of previously visited sites.
And if we discover weapons of mass destruction in other sites, it will explain why the inspectors could not have found if the inspections had continued.
The fourth argument is used to envy the propaganda on both sides.
The war was - she justified in terms of costs and outcomes? Was - it really the last resort?
To answer these questions, it will objectively assess the cost of the war. It will take into account the loss of life, destruction, the emergence of other forms of violence (terrorism, for example), as well as the economic impact of the conflict on Iraq and its geopolitical consequences.
To date, Bush and Blair have managed to convince a portion of their own public opinion.
The American people were served an array from simple patriotism to chauvinism through the manipulation of fear and confusion between Iraq and bin Laden's networks.
But this did not convince the rest of the world sees this war with a mixture of scorn and concern.
That will change if the four arguments prove accurate.
When the 13 British colonies in North America have engaged in the War of Independence, Thomas Jefferson felt he had to explain why the name of "respect for the opinions of mankind." Were set out in the Declaration of Independence.
Such an explanation, based on a rigorous argument, is as necessary today.
If the reasons for initiating this war is not confirmed, the consequences would be severe.
Propaganda, pictures of Iraqis cheering US and British troops and amazement at the precision of smart bombs should not hide a terrible truth: Bush and Blair have broken the peace premeditated and organized massacres against the vast majority of world opinion.
Heal the divisions of the planet requires strengthening the authority of the UN and change leaders in the US and England.
Given its terrible costs, I hope that this war will appear justified. But on the evidence known today, I doubt it.
If it is proven unequivocally that Iraq was storing weapons of mass destruction ready for use to constitute a serious threat and that it was unlikely that the UN inspections can detect, we will recognize the validity of the arguments of Bush and Blair.
But even then, the war was can - not be the best solution, compared with a policy to contain the danger posed by Iraq.
But in this case, the war has had a meaning.
The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan absurd war is almost too frightening for daring to consider.
Remembering and Forgetting Zhao Ziyang.
Thus the former Chinese leader and General Secretary of the Communist Party Zhao Ziyang has died.
Policy choices he had married during the mandate is they are long dead: May 19, 1989, when he appeared in Tiananmen Square just before dawn to beg, with tears in his eyes, and ask forgiveness of protesters.
"I'm really sorry," he told the audience.
"I arrived too late.".
After that, he existed more as an historical chimera than a real person.
When his bizarre and unscheduled appearance in the square was broadcast on China Central TV station the next morning, when one of the last days of uncensored media coverage, throughout China, the audience was surprised by that time fleeting official anxiety and too human.
After all, Party leaders rarely evince their personal feelings in public, much less when it comes to break the line of the Party as shamelessly as Zhao did.
Such individualism fit neither Leninist nor traditional Chinese proscriptions of conduct for senior officials.
As the crackdown following those heady weeks of free expression and assembly came to its apocalyptic end on the night of June 3 to 4, Zhao vanished, sucked down the memory hole of the Party where so many other leaders have vanished since the "socialist liberation" of China.
To the discredit of the democratic world, there was almost no head of state to protest in defense of Zhao, asking only account for its illegal and immoral incarceration.
Instead, Zhao's life was held in abeyance, under house arrest, conveniently forgotten as a sort of celebrity cryogenically frozen, with no hope of resurrection.
Zhao was not killed, but allowed to live in an old Beijing courtyard house with his family.
He was allowed to go out from time to time, but under guard like a zoo animal, to go to the bathroom or play alone golf, one of the manifestations of "bourgeois liberalization" that his reform efforts allowed to enter China's once hermetic seal.
Chinese have long since used the deaths of defrocked leaders as an opportunity to show their feelings, which can not be expressed through an ordinary political process.
In the winter of 1976, when Premier Zhou Enlai (viewed as a liberal in the Maoist hierarchy) died, tens of thousands of people spontaneously flooded Tiananmen Square, giving the Party a scare.
It was, of course, the death of former Party chief Hu Yaobang, a liberal like Zhao, which sparked the 1989 protests.
It is not certain that Zhao's supporters are expressed in the same way.
The events of 1989 remain so sensitive, and Tiananmen Square so securely guarded, that it is hard to imagine that it may soon produce any event.
At the same time, China seems so drugged on business nowadays that it is hard to imagine many people marching for a cause that would not add to the total line.
It is as if the Communist Party had turned Marx and replaced religion with profits in the role of the new "opium of the masses".
Few people outside of the poorest classes of unemployed and dispossessed peasants seem to have a taste for political protest.
By cons, Zhao embodied a chapter in Chinese history in which stand as a reformer meant not only the economy but also all aspects of daily life.
Before becoming leader and leader of the Party, he experienced many fields such as collectivization of agriculture and separation of business of the party, to laws guaranteeing the rights of journalists and greater openness towards the outside world for ordinary people.
He was even the first Chinese leader to wear a suit and tie rather than a Mao habit when traveling abroad and the first to take part in open press conferences.
Although Zhao was no visionary, no Vaclav Havel or Lech Walesa, and not even anti - communist, its program in the mid-1980s embraced the economy, politics, culture, media, and society and led to one of the richest and most open periods intellectually in Chinese history.
It was a tragic paradox that the political movement that so peacefully swept China in 1989 eventually stop the broad reform process and evolutionary which Zhao consecrated his life.
The Party leadership was so chastened by the trauma of June 4 during the years that followed, it was unclear whether the reform would survive.
Then, in 1992, Deng Xiaoping set in motion one of march√©isations of the fastest and most complete society in history, catalyzing the spectacular rise of China transformed into super - economic power.
Zhao Ziyang's death reminds us not only that he was treated unfairly, but also how China's reforms have been uneven.
For the "miracle" to truly become miraculous Chinese, Party leaders would do well to study the legacy of a man they now seem eager to push into oblivion.
The real risks deficits.
Deficits are back, and they want revenge.
The US government budget deficit now stands at $ 455 billion, or 4.1% of GNP.
Two years ago, the United - States predicted a budget surplus over many years.
Although slightly less affected than the United - States, other rich countries fall into the budget deficit.
The European Commission believes that the French government deficit will reach 3.7% of GDP this year, against 3.4% for Germany; these numbers go far - beyond the deficit cap (3% of GDP) set by the Stability Pact and the euro area growth.
By being in deficit, a country increases its national debt and imposes a burden on future generations.
Politicians naturally prefer to hide how wealth is performing the movements between generations.
They are designed primarily to address immediate problems and to collect the benefits promised today.
Accountants who compute government deficits try to keep politicians from fooling us into accepting the benefits they offer without understanding what will be the future cost.
But these do not offer accounting method to know when deficits are justifiable and when they are not.
The deficits not only cause immediate political issues, but also issues of distributive justice between generations and intergenerational risk sharing.
No generation should be forced to accept unnecessary economic risks imposed by another generation.
The possibility that deficits treat future generations properly depends on how are designed tax and expenditure systems of government.
Supporters of uninterrupted deficits often portray as a necessary evil to restore an economy in which confidence crumbles.
Inspired by Keynes, they argue that uninterrupted deficits will restore confidence before the onset of a recession or depression.
But this effectively is to administer to a patient on Prozac before he becomes suicidal.
Such arguments, although perfectly legitimate at times, have limitations.
Japan's public deficits spawned a national debt amounting to 140% of annual GDP, without producing an economic resurgence.
Indeed, the current budget deficits reflect long-term problems that do not correspond at all to what is provided Keynesian theory.
Debates on deficits must therefore be redefined in terms of inter generations important problems in the long term.
The problems are subtle because they depend on the actions of future governments.
In the past, some governments, when faced with considerable national debt, "deflated" effectively.
They have thus removed the burden to the next generation which is actually returned to investors who do not withdraw the bond market the first signs of rising prices or have delayed the purchase of their home while the inflation would have wiped out the real value of their mortgages.
Governments could again decide to act in this direction, especially if national debts believe more.
The resurgence of considerable inflation may seem unthinkable in today's environment, but remember that even an annual inflation rate of 6% relatively modest decreases the real value of the debt of a nation just over 6 and a half years.
It is possible that public opposition continues a gradual increase in inflation does not stand long.
Some politicians may succeed again to anchor the idea that inflation, being stimulative, is a boon to the economy.
But in addition to the officially measured deficits of current governments, it must also reckon with some impending obligations caused by a demographic change (declining birth rates) and with the prospect of considerable amounts of payments for social benefits in the future.
The scope of these obligations is monumental.
In their 2003 report, the directors of the US Social Security Administration Trust Funds estimate that maintaining the solvency of the social security system for the next 75 years will cost $ 3.5 trillion, or about the amount of the current total government debt US (3.9 trillion dollars).
The administrators of the US Medicare Trust Funds (which provides medical services to the retired) estimate that their floating bonds now worth 5.9 trillion dollars, more than half of the official public national debt of America.
The possibility of a budget shortfall in social security and health is much worse in Europe and Japan due to more difficult demographic statistics.
Moreover, unlike official national debt, social benefits in terms of obligations are not related to currency.
Rather, they represent the promise of a certain standard of living (including the value of medical services), corrected for inflation.
No government can thus the "deflate".
But this does not mean that pensions and other social obligations are completely frozen.
This means that the problem is political.
Pensioners are one of the most powerful lobbies in a democracy, and politicians are reluctant to face on an issue so vital.
We still have to firmly deal with problems that cross generations are at the heart of current economic dilemmas.
Our pension systems and our national budgets must be based on a "generational accounting" which ensures that the economic risk is spread systematically across generations.
This means that pension funds and tax should be designed to take greater account of the changing circumstances faced by different generations, rather than make fixed promises, which will most certainly not be held in any case, d a certain recovery in the future.
For example, when demographic or economic hardship incessant trends impose burdens on workers in social services, the benefits due to retirees should automatically be changed by increasing the retirement age and / or the profit adjustment.
These adjustments will likely be in the following decades, but only after a long lag and with many inequities.
We need a fair system from the start in order to manage risks that span several generations rationally.
These problems can - they be resolved today, as the economic slowdown in most developed countries leads most politicians to focus on results in the short term?
Bad times, like the Great Depression, helped to introduce decisive changes.
Under effective leadership (which unfortunately seems to be lacking), the more temperate tests today could help lead a public discussion on the most appropriate methods of sharing intergenerational risks.
Say no to Bush.
That made three years that the US president is pursuing a unilateral program, refusing any evidence that contradicts his positions and neglecting the fundamental and historic American principles.
Take the example of global warming.
In this field, Bush is conspicuously absent without leave (AWOL in US military jargon).
From time to time, it calls into question scientific theories.
(We know, of course, that academic performance Bush never impressed person).
Bush's position is more than wrong; it puts us in a quandary.
In fact, when Bush asked the US National Academy of Sciences to examine the issue, the verdict was resounding greenhouse gases pose a serious threat (it is the only verdict they could produce) .
But US automakers love their cars that consume a lot of gasoline and Bush's buddies in the oil industry do not admit any interference with their destruction of the atmosphere of the planet.
Also we do not change environmental policies.
In Iraq, Bush again pursued a unilateral program, explaining that he held irrefutable evidence of Saddam's links to Al Qaeda and that he possessed weapons of mass destruction.
Even before the US invasion, there was overwhelming evidence proving that Bush was lying.
Detection technologies had made it clear that Iraq had no nuclear weapons, as chief UN inspector Hans Blix pointed it out.
It is possible that Bush read those reports, but they exceeded his intellectual abilities of comprehension.
It is also possible that he did not believe what he was reading.
Anyway, American policy was not based on scientific evidence.
Since the end of the Cold War, America is the only super - world power.
Yet it failed to exercise the kind of power needed to create a new world order based on principles such as fairness.
Europe and the rest of the world are aware of this failure but they do not vote in US elections.
Even so, the world is not without recourse.
The rest of the world should simply oppose Bush and him.
America has not acquired the hearts and minds of Iraqis, but instead lost them, just as it has lost the hearts and minds of many people.
States - States wants to retain control of the occupation but also want others take the bullets today decimate US troops.
UN forces do not have to bear the consequences of the US failure to manage the occupation and therefore calls for financial assistance are launching States - States should remain unanswered.
What can the US program sympathies - they draw when we see that President Bush has provided hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts to the richest people in the world?
There are yet not so long ago, the Republican Congress retained the sum of one billion dollars he owed to the United Nations and threatened to not pay what he owed only if the UN satisfy a set of measures.
The unwillingness of America to fund peace meanly hard contrast to the fantastic sums that Congress quickly enlisted in the war effort.
Advocates a moderate approach say that if the United Nations does not imply it will be their death warrant. By participating in the Iraqi occupation, it will restore the confidence of States - States so that the next impact of this kind, America will turn more quickly to the United Nations.
This is absurd.
The occupants of the White House today believe strongly in.
I usually take care of economics, not politics.
However, at the time of globalization in this new world, economic interdependence is stronger and requires action, regulations, and more collective institutions and an international rule of law.
Economic globalization has outpaced political globalization, however, and the processes of decision making are far from democratic, or even transparent.
In many cases, we can establish that the failures of globalization back to the same mindset that governs the failure of the Iraqi occupation: the pluralist institutions should not be in the interests of a single country but from any country.
During the recent summit of the World Trade Organization (WTO), held in Cancun, developing countries said to America, and Europe, this system could not last.
In this case, Europe is just as guilty as America.
Europe has no trouble seeing the dangers of unilateralism in US equities, since the withdrawal of Kyoto to its refusal to participate in the International Criminal Court.
But Europe should also reflect on its own practices, including its trade policies, especially when the EU is bent on systematically destabilize the regime of international trade and disadvantage developing countries, despite promises to restore the balance with the current negotiations.
Here, Europe acts like America, which has long adopted the rhetoric of free trade, while its actions have long ignored the principles.
Missed American rhetoric on justice and equity, in trade negotiations, States - United ignore the plea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe poorest countries in the world to end cotton subsidies that have such a devastating effect on them.
If we make a politically more secure and economically more stable and prosperous, political globalization will have to be at the economic globalization.
The principles of democracy, social justice, social solidarity and the rule of law will be extended to - across national borders.
Europe and the rest of the world will have their own work: these principles self - and push each other, and America, in the right direction.
For now, this requires "just say no" to President Bush.
The real cost of war in Iraq.
In life, the most important things, like life itself - well, not price.
But this does not mean that issues involving the preservation of life (or a way of life), like defense, should not be screened cold and rigorous economic analysis.
Shortly before the current Iraq war, when Larry Lindsey, the economist of the Bush administration, suggested that the costs might range between 100 and 200 billion, other senior officials quickly demurred.
For example, the Director of Budget and Management Mitch Daniels would have raised that figure to $ 60 billion.
It now appears that Lindsey's estimates were grossly under - estimated.
Worried about the Bush administration may be fooling everyone on the cost of the Iraq war, as it has done on weapons of mass destruction and ties with al-Qaeda, I associated myself to Linda Bilmes, a Harvard budget expert to examine the problem.
Even we who are opposed to the war, were staggered by what we found: We estimate modest to moderate, ranging from slightly less than a trillion dollars to more than 2 billion.
Our analysis starts with the $ 500 billion that talks openly about the Congressional Budget Office, which is still ten times higher than what the administration said the cost of the war.
Its estimate falls so far short because the reported numbers do not even include the full budgetary costs to the government.
And the budgetary costs are a fraction of the cost of the entire economy.
The Bush administration, for example, is doing everything it can to hide the huge number of returning veterans who are severely injured 16 000 for the moment, more or less 20% with serious injuries to the brain and head.
Surprising therefore that his figure of $ 500 billion ignores disability and health costs for lifetimes that the government expects to pay in the coming years.
The administration does not confront the problems of military recruitment and retention of troops.
The consequence is paying big bonuses to those who commit to new, more benefits and higher recruiting costs: an increase of 20% just between 2003 and 2005.
In addition, the war greatly use the equipment, which will require replacement part.
These budgetary costs (exclusive of interest) amount to $ 652 billion in our conservative estimate and $ 799 billion in our moderate estimate.
We can assume that since the government has not reined in other expenditures or increased taxes, these expenses were financed by debt, and the interest cost of this debt add another $ 98 billion (conservative) 385 billion (moderate) to the budgetary costs.
Naturally, the greatest burden of injury and death is borne by soldiers and their families.
But the military pays disability benefits that are markedly lower than the value of lost earnings.
Similarly, payments for those who are killed amounted to $ 500 000, which is far less than standard estimates of the economic cost of a death of a life, which is sometimes referred to as statistical value of a life (from 6.1 to 6.5 million).
But the costs do not stop there.
The Bush administration once claimed that the Iraq war would be good for the economy and a door - word even suggested that it was the best way to ensure low oil prices.
As is often the case, things have turned out differently: the oil companies are the big winners, while the American and global economies are losers.
Being extremely conservative, we estimate the total effect on the economy if only $ 5 or $ 10 of the increase is attributed to the war.
At the same time, money spent on the war could have been spent elsewhere.
We believe that if some of that money had been invested in roads, schools and research, the American economy would have been stimulated more in the short term and its growth would have been higher in the long term.
There are a number of other costs, some potentially important, which are very difficult to quantify.
For example, Americans annually pay $ 300 billion for the "value option" (potential value) of their military preparedness, which allows them to be ready to fight where necessary.
The fact that Americans are willing to pay this suggests that the option value exceeds the costs.
But there is little doubt that it has been greatly reduced and will remain so for several years.
In short, even our "moderate" estimate may sub - significantly estimate the cost of US involvement in Iraq.
And our estimate does not include costs implied by the enormous loss of life and property in Iraq.
We do not try to explain that the American people were deliberately misled about the costs of war, or the gross under - estimation of the Bush administration should be blamed on the incompetence, like that - it vehemently argues in the case of weapons of mass destruction.
We are not going to try to assess whether there were more cost effective ways of waging war.
Recent evidence that deaths and injuries would have been greatly reduced had better body armor provided to troops suggests how short-run frugality can lead to long-term costs.
It is undeniable that when programming a war is a matter of choice, as was the case here, inadequate preparation is even less justifiable.
But such considerations appear to be beyond the calculations of the Bush administration.
The analyzes developed costs and benefits of major projects have been standard practice in the defense department and other departments for almost half - century.
The Iraq war was an immense "project," yet it now appears that the analysis of its benefits was greatly flawed and that of its costs virtually absent.
One can not help but ask the following: there - was - there alternative ways of spending a fraction of 1 to 2 trillion dollars of war in projects that would have better strengthened security, increased prosperity and promoted democracy?
Liberty enough - it?
Democracies - they need values?
This question seems absurd in the light of photographs of American soldiers torturing and humiliating their Iraqi prisoners.
The fact is that the progress of democracy have gone hand in hand with an erosion of common values ‚Äã‚Äãand the preponderance of individual autonomy.
It requires moral agnosticism and plurality of references, none being dedicated and binding.
Democracy certainly cultivates values, but they are generally more liberal - in other words, individual rights take precedence over collective obligations.
For all democrats today, the fullest possible respect for the autonomy of the individual remains, as asked Thomas Jefferson, "obvious".
However, human rights, civil and political rights - it sufficient to affirm the strength and survival of democracies?
Contemporary democracies are - they sufficiently virtuous to gather the energies - including self-sacrifice - needed to defeat their enemies?
For a long time these questions showed no urgency, partly because the basic democratic values ‚Äã‚Äãwere less abstract than they seem today.
These values ‚Äã‚Äãhave fueled the fight against the Nazi and Soviet totalitarianism, fascism and military dictatorship. On their behalf, the minorities are seen to recognize the rights to equality and dignity, decolonization was conducted.
Democratic values ‚Äã‚Äãmay - be partisan in the defense of human rights, but it gives them a universality which legitimizes the struggle against oppression wherever it occurs.
Yet in the most advanced countries, the promise of material prosperity made possible through freedom has long since replaced attention to democratic values ‚Äã‚Äãand their defense as a social cement.
Westerners do not rush to emulate the freedom fighters who gave birth to their society, despite the celebrations, places of memory and the persistence of oppression.
The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 against the United - States has changed all that - not only international relations but also the balance between the rights and obligations we have long considered granted.
In fact, the collapse of the Twin Towers, which was a surprising event in its terms, its symbolic nature and scope, changed nothing.
In him - even, it reveals that the urgency of a fundamental reassessment is long overdue.
That truly is our Western democratic development model?
Some non-democratic systems of values ‚Äã‚Äãthat seem to cause more adhesion because they are based on community solidarity, religion or nation, in short, because private companies cause less exhaust, doubt and distance, critical or frivolous public companies.
In - Beyond fundamental freedoms and our economic and social system, have - we defend a specific company?
Our civilization prefers companies that accept selfishness over his family and his group, who tolerate under rare reserve the "license" for m? sisters, who consider that blasphemy, criticism of power and even civil disobedience fundamental freedoms are.
Better still be worth companies like ours who know ailments such as drug use, prostitution, alcoholism, incivility of acts of vandalism if not, that regime mullahs or soldiers, because these social problems can be dissipated or even completely eliminated, without changing their foundations.
This is not true of totalitarian or fundamentalist regimes that must be felled to give birth to free societies.
But what - we replicate the fundamentalists of all stripes who find that the most resolute fighters are on their side, if our civilization is worth defending?
Can - we oppose them something other than individual freedoms?
Two temptations contrary to our principles must be denounced.
The first is the return to values ‚Äã‚Äã"traditional" own against Feared companies: one - will not only mean the decline and closure but sometimes hate.
The second temptation is a modern variation on the gunboat diplomacy that focuses on physical strength without consideration for projecting an increased credibility and legitimacy.
When enemies attack us, we must certainly respond immediately without asking too many questions.
If enemies threaten us, it is better to first assert its legitimacy, hence gain credibility internally first, then externally.
Do not that settles too discrepancy between the statement of principles and the reality of our behavior.
Values ‚Äã‚Äãcan not, not, as formerly, born of Heaven, of nature, of reason or a law of history.
Our values ‚Äã‚Äãare to take shape in and through democratic debate, without more, our defense must involve three areas that can not be separated.
We will increasingly need to update our social contract.
France has tried to do with the debate that it has initiated and concluded by a law on secularism, a major undertaking even though it could have been better driving and do better show the link between principles, social realities and anthropological and major policies.
Such a debate should also involve the school, its rules, objectives and contents that it must convey.
Note, however, that in many countries, political parties have difficulties to engage in such discussions.
The second major focus of such action values ‚Äã‚Äãrecreation concerns what I call social and fiscal constitution of society, to which must be added the environmental rules.
Questions called "community" issues away fortunes, the legitimacy of inequality, the definition of justice, redistribution, etc. come with increased strength in the political debate.
This debate has not happened in the United - States, despite the attempts of the beginning of the Clinton era; he had only initial response to the Kingdom - Kingdom and Germany with Blair's Third Way and the variant that gave Schr√∂der.
In France, it has stagnated due to the strength of the distribution of conflict, the excessive division of the left and the lack of economic and social vision of the right.
Are the values ‚Äã‚Äãrelated to the New World Order: of course, prior to defend such values ‚Äã‚Äãis exemplary and not "procedural" values ‚Äã‚Äãrelated to crisis management arrangements and dispute settlement.
We must also take care that short-term interests do not harm more fundamental long-term objectives.
The fight in defense of democracy can not be selective.
Some desirable vision for the future of the world must appeal to shared conceptions of justice and equity.
We must all become freedom fighters.
Last hope for Venezuela: the elections.
Venezuela is paralyzed in a dangerous impasse.
President Hugo Ch√°vez clings to power despite the obvious failure of his government marked by a severe economic deterioration and dangerous political polarization.
The opposition, tainted by his failed coup of April 2002, now seeks to force Ch√°vez to resign by the organization of a costly general strike.
Each party justifies his intransigence with tendentious arguments.
Sympathizers glorify Ch√°vez as a defender of the poor besieged by a selfish and comploteuse elite.
His fiercest opponents have Ch√°vez as an evil autocrat instigator of a revolution in Cuba ready to annihilate democracy.
These two views are questionable.
The Ch√°vez government has not been a great help for the most disadvantaged classes of Venezuela.
On the contrary, his belligerent rhetoric and irrational governance have spooked investors, leading to economic decline and rising unemployment and poverty.
Today Ch√°vez no longer has the support of the majority of the lower classes.
The opposition consists of most of organized civil society in Venezuela: the business world, but also trade unions, professional associations and NGOs.
Thus the polarization in place in Venezuela does not oppose "poor" to "the oligarchy," but a populist civil society.
The opinion of the opposition, shared by the right wing of the Bush administration, is also unconvincing.
Rather than start a revolution, Ch√°vez recites a fiery rhetoric.
While his Democratic qualities are bad, he never.
But Ch√°vez's insistence on the inviolability of the current constitution is hypocritical.
Four years earlier, Ch√°vez has separated from the old constitution by using a plebiscite to create a new, custom-made for him.
Now he invokes that charter to push calls to a plebiscite on the continuation of its mandate.
The paradox here is that Ch√°vez gave the example earlier of what could be the solution of today's impasse.
Since Mr. Ch√°vez used the paraconstitutionnels means to promote his desire for change in 1999, the international community is not limited to the constitution in force to resolve the crisis which corrodes the nation.
In fact, the Latin - American countries members of the "group of friendly nations" trying to mediate this conflict can draw an interesting experience to design such a solution.
After all, such confrontations are not extraordinary for rigid presidential systems in Latin America.
When the elected government leaders for fixed terms not enjoy any political support, they can not be deprived by a motion of censure as it exists in parliamentary systems.
Presidential systems therefore can experience extensive conflicts that pose a threat to democracy, as is the case in Venezuela right now.
However, during the last decade, politicians Latin - American gave more flexibility to presidential systems innovating for dismissal of presidents without popular support.
A discredited predecessors Ch√°vez was removed from office as a result of some serious charges of malfeasance; Ecuador's parliament declared a catastrophic president "mentally incompetent"; Peru, an autocratic president was forced into exile after months of international and local pressures.
When politicians interpreted the law with a certain amount of creativity in these circumstances, they usually do to ensure the survival of fragile democracies in crisis.
As these maneuvers remain contained and does not turn into easy ammunition for the opposition of the time, they act as a safety valve for presidential systems.
International monitoring can also serve as guard - mad against frivolous use of such mechanisms.
Hopefully the group of friendly nations can help to develop an innovative solution in the case of the Venezuelan impasse.
To be accepted by both parties, such a solution can not meet the wishes of both parties.
The opposition prefers a vote "all or nothing" about the continuation of the mandate of Mr Ch√°vez, a vote she would probably win but Ch√°vez probably never accept.
Ch√°vez insists layoff referendum mechanism in its constitution, which the opposition can not tolerate: get rid of the president and would require a much larger number of votes than those collected by Ch√°vez in the last elections.
And increasing abstention makes this virtually - impossible.
Neither of the two proposals is therefore politically possible.
Only a democratic mechanism solution to the conflict would not predict the outcome of the consultation is likely to be passed.
This mechanism is an election, to organize as soon (this summer seems more realistic).
Each party will work hard - stand to win.
The opposition, tense, must go - beyond rejection of Ch√°vez; it will develop a program to rebuild the country and unite to support an attractive candidate.
President Ch√°vez will need to clarify the content and meaning of his "Bolivarian Revolution."
To the extent that Ch√°vez is a skilled politician and opposition remains divided, he will have a good chance of winning, which should make him accept this solution.
The group pressures friendly nations could lead each party to accept this last chance to avoid a political meltdown.
Elections can be legitimized by an amendment to the constitution to reduce the presidential term, as Jimmy Carter proposes in his recent mediation effort.
As this would be designed to defuse a crisis of exceptional magnitude, it does not set a precedent that encourages frivolous attacks on Latin governments - American elected democratically.
The organization of elections in Venezuela today save democracy but did not undermine.
Dangerous Liaisons Syria.
All eyes are on Syria since the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
Lebanese opposition groups, as supporters of Mr. Hariri openly accusing the regime of Bashir Assad, the Syrian president, to be responsible for the killings.
The Bush administration, while not formally blaming Syria, is not far from the same thing and just recalled its ambassador to Damascus.
It is said States - United very angry against Syria and its refusal to withdraw its troops from Lebanon as required by a UN resolution.
The growing opposition against Syrian hegemony in Lebanon is only one of four similar problems Syria faces and has treated inappropriately.
The other three problems are the actions of Syria in Iraq, its relations with the states - the United States and the need for domestic reforms.
While corrosive immobility is a hallmark of the Syrian regime, these challenges threaten to reinforce each other and marginalize Syria even more than it is already internationally.
In Lebanon, the Syrians have continued to misunderstand the Bush administration's intentions.
Last September, the United - States, with the support of France, supported the Resolution 1559 of the UN Security Council demanding the withdrawal of Syrian troops and the disarmament of militias and Hezbollah mainly.
This occurred after the unconstitutional extension of the term of Lebanese President Emile Lahoud, despite being in French and American guard, forcibly imposed by Assad in September.
So far, however, privately say Syrian officials they do not think that States - United are serious about the withdrawal.
Syrian leaders continue to reject applications from Lebanon to stop the Syrian military presence in place for 28 years.
These requirements have become more pressing since the death of Mr. Hariri, when tens of thousands of supporters of former Prime Minister demanded the departure of Syria, while not taking position so far on Syria.
Indeed, a broad front of multi-community opposition has formed in Beirut to demand the departure of Syria.
Yet rather than meet the requirements of this front and create healthy bilateral relations between countries on the same footing, Syria has sought to divide the opposition to reassert its control.
The assassination of Mr. Hariri further complicates the situation and Syria must prepare for a strong reaction on the part of France and the States - States.
In Iraq, since the fall of Baghdad on 9 April 2003, Damascus has shown a misplaced nostalgia towards the old system.
Despite fierce opposition that separated the Syrian and Iraqi Baath parties, they consoled themselves both through their membership of a confederation of despots.
For the Syrians, a democratic Iraq, friendly to States - United has always been worse than Saddam Hussein, an enemy they knew well and with whom they have made profitable exchanges, when Iraq was under economic sanctions International.
The support of Iraqi Baathists exiles attributed to Syria threatens to harm its relations with the new Iraq.
Baghdad has repeatedly accused the Assad regime to let circulate Iraqi funds channeled to insurgents, and recently notified the Syrians from the discovery of a photograph of a senior Syrian intelligence in the company of an Islamist fighter , photo found on the body of the latter in Fallujah.
Following the elections, legitimate power is emerging in Iraq and the Syrians will have the foresight to getting rid of their friends pro - Saddam.
The growing impatience of the Bush administration vis - a - vis the Syrian involvement in the Iraqi rebellion is one of the main reasons for the deterioration of relations between states - the United States and Syria.
Indeed, Washington's disdain for Syria is evident.
That is why Syria's denials about its destructive role in Iraq are rarely taken seriously and that is why Mr Assad enjoys no American support for renewed negotiations with Israel over the Plateau Golan.
There are also signs that the Syrians are unable to gauge American intentions on other issues.
Assad, for example, still does not understand, apparently, how much the Bush administration associates his regime with terrorism.
Syrian officials believe that secularism of the Baath party guarantees the continued support of the States - United against Islamist resurgence.
They do not understand that American officials regard Syria as complicit in the activities of Islamist terrorist groups in the Palestinian territories, Iraq and Lebanon.
Home, the Assad regime also encountered some difficulties.
Political and economic reforms forward in small steps, when they argue.
One of the main discussion points in Syria is the revival of Islam as an alternative to a political and economic system that offers little encouragement, except in the case of the great figures of the regime.
The opposition of France to the Syrian presence in Lebanon was partly the result of his disenchantment vis - a - vis the reformist ambitions of Mr Assad and the European Union has expressed similar reservations.
Assad is now entering a consolidation phase, leaving little room for reform.
Indeed, his new interior minister, Ghazi Kanaan, a supporter of the hard line belonging to the old school, is leading to a tightening reformers and Kurds during the year just s elapse.
The reshuffle last November that brought to power and other Kanaan was considered the reflection of the preferences of Mr. Assad.
In the coming months, several retirement cycles should allow the president to place his pieces in positions of responsibility.
Consolidation, however, is by no reform.
Assad must show that his enhanced authority can lead to genuine transformation.
So far, the president has followed a hard line toward Iraq, Lebanon and internal affairs.
If it is really a reformer, he has not convinced many people.
Syria may pay - be very expensive this ambiguity.
Home Racial divided Europe.
The extreme right in Europe is characterized by its racism and its use of the issue of immigration as a political divergence.
Lega Nord in Italy, the Vlaams Blok in the Netherlands - Netherlands, the supporters of the National Front of Le Pen in France, are all examples of parties or movements formed on the current theme of aversion to immigrants and promotion simplistic policies to control them.
While individuals like Jorg Haidar and Jean - Marie Le Pen can come and (soon enough) to come, the racial issue will never go away of European policy in the near future.
An aging population and increasingly open borders imply increasing racial fragmentation in European countries.
The dominant parties of the left and center right center clashed this perspective by applying the policy of the ostrich, hoping against hope that the problem would disappear.
It will not be the case, as clearly demonstrates the racial history of America.
Race relations in the United - States have monopolized for decades - and still monopolize - the front of the political stage, to the point that racial divisions occupy a place as important as income, if not more, as determinants of preferences and political attitudes.
The first step to address the issue of racial politics is to understand the origin and consequences of racial animosity, even if it involves the discovery of unpleasant truths to hear.
This is precisely the aim pursued largely by economics research teams, sociology, psychology and political science in the United - States.
This research demonstrates that the representatives of different races are much less confident with each other; whites are less likely to support welfare spending, which they, promote minorities; more racially fragmented communities have less efficient governments, corruption and a major influence peddling, higher crime rates and less productive public goods per dollar taxed.
This does not mean eliminate heterogeneity and create racially homogenous communities, but it is necessary to recognize the reality of these problems in order to begin to develop sound public policies on race relations.
Of course, Americans are challenging the methods to use.
Some are in favor of affirmative action programs that give minorities preference in the award of a job, admission to the university and public contracts.
These policies are seen as a way to provide reparations for past injustices and, more importantly, create role models and overcome the remaining discrimination and can - be involuntary.
Other protest against affirmative action and support a policy that does not care about race, combined with the policies of free market and pro-family values, is enough to create jobs for minorities and help not separate Black families.
This last point is crucial in any policy as one of the most important causes of poverty in the United - States is the distribution of single parents (read single mother) in the black community.
Whatever the answer, the question is that the determination of actions regarding race is a dominant issue in American politics.
Of course, minorities have made progress towards more integration and economic success.
In the 1950s, blacks could not sit in front of the bus, now two of the major players in US foreign policy are black.
One can not deny that the right-wing American politicians continue to deploy the "race card" as a tactical tool.
Take the case of Patrick Buchanan, former assistant to Nixon and Reagan, which has brought an independent presidential candidate in the last election.
He recently published a successful book called "The Death of the West: How Dying Populations and Immigrant Invasion imperil Our Country and Civilization."
But for every book like this - one, there are ten others who have a serious analysis of the issue of race in America.
The analysis and policy debates on race relations have significantly delayed in Europe.
At most, the question is examined closely in terms of immigration quotas and border restrictions, not in terms of opportunities and social problems created by a Europe increasingly racially mixed.
Of course, a clear immigration policy is required to prevent the accumulation of illegal immigrants.
But we must not stop there: border controls in Mexico does not mean the end of US policy on domestic issues of race!
Europe is rich and rapidly aging population: Europeans, backed by generous welfare programs, are no longer prepared to accept "dirty jobs" in, say, agriculture and the leather sector.
This attitude makes it inevitable increases in immigration.
However, Europeans are quick to criticize States - United for the failures of their policies towards minorities and for any manifestation of racism on the other side of the Atlantic.
Reading the European press often reveals a superiority complex towards the United - States on racial issues: they (the Americans) have problems with racism; we are immune against him, with the exception of skinhead neo - Nazis and their like crazy.
What happened in recent weeks, from Paris to Amsterdam, demonstrates that the racial problem in Europe is deeper and, as in the United - States, is caused by the sad truth that race relations are inherently difficult and trust and cooperative behavior does not travel well on racial lines.
If the dominant parties in Europe do not engage more seriously to understand the racial tensions that exist in their countries and to place the "race" in the center of their priorities, individuals like Le Pen still attempt to try to fill the void with their message of hate.
Fighting the French exception.
The attention of Europe is now whole tour and about to enlargement and the constitution being negotiated between Member States.
However, the result of several Gallic spats with the European Commission will be no less important in determining the fate of the new enlarged Europe.
France has unilaterally chosen to ignore the Stability and Growth Pact leaving run its government deficit - beyond the limit of 3% of GDP.
The French like to talk about the rational rigor of their thinking, but where budgets are concerned, Descartes is no longer appropriate and confusion comes in.
France was one of the leading critics of Ireland when, in 2000, the Irish government reduced its budget surplus, then to 4%, than a simple 0.5%.
Other countries have not respected the Stability Pact, but France is the first country to do so with a smirk openly dismissive.
None of this should surprise.
France is only applying to the European regulations very well entrenched habit of regarding one's own culture as an exception.
For example, France consistently vetoes any reform of the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union.
As everyone knows, the CAP is a very nice gift offered to the rich European farmers (particularly French farmers) who does not deserve it, at the expense of struggling farmers in developing countries and European consumers.
France also trying to return to the old policies of bailing out private companies in deficit and on the verge of collapse in public money reinforcement.
European Commissioner for Competition, Mario Monti, can not lose this battle: he needs the support of those who have faith in markets and equal treatment for all.
The story is simple.
The French government plans to bail out Alstom, a company that has developed high-tech products, including the TGV, the French high-speed train, but recently is bankrupt.
The French government proclaims that he will never abandon its rescue plan for Alstom, a plan that has all the usual dirigiste motivations: maintaining employment, protecting investors, etc ..
Moreover, to the extent that Alstom is a high-tech company, the French government opts for research and development, arguing that investment in R & D is beneficial to growth.
Save Alstom by nationalizing the company is obviously a mistake.
The company is made up of different units, some profitable, others bankrupt: it is clear that it must be dismantled.
Profitable units, such as the TGV, will easily find buyer; deficit units must be closed.
Money French taxpayers will be better spent on temporary costs of retraining employees rather than keep alive a company that is not profitable.
It is important that the European Commission will not allow France to carve custom laws for her - even in competition policy, as it seems to be doing it with budget deficits.
The Commission must condemn the public funding of private companies in France as it condemns subsidies in any other Member State EU.
The Commission has already had some success on this side - there, especially by forcing Germany to cancel government guarantees of public banks.
Alstom in particular and France in general should not be an exception and must meet the same standards.
If the Commission does not react, the European Union still look more like a playground for French officials.
France has already taken the lead in foreign policy of the European Union with its foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, who acts and looks more and more like a foreign minister of Europe.
At the same time, France ignores the essential regulations of common economic policy and government support for private companies.
The European Commission it will lose what little credibility he has left to end up looking like a Parisian arrondissement smaller?
Losing the issue of Alstom would have serious repercussions in Europe, not just for competition policy.
The war for oil.
For decades, both Republicans and Democrats have the same objectives in the oil industry: to maintain as possible the stability of oil prices, smoothly reduce domestic consumption, reduce dependence linked to import and diversify sources of foreign supply.
Despite appearances, these goals are still the same today, under the Bush administration.
Many observers believe that with the invasion of Iraq, Bush chose a different path.
A significant increase in Iraqi production would probably increase US dependence on oil.
The price of oil will drop no doubt with the emergence of a new source of supply, leading to increased dependency of the USA, especially vis - a - vis the Middle - East.
It is ironic that the US exercised greater control over Iraqi oil under the program "oil against food" UN before the war (it was then the UN, not Saddam Hussein who was staring at the level Iraqi exports) they may do so in the context of a future democratic Iraqi state.
If the Bush administration was seeking stable sources of oil supply, secure, diverse and cheap, it was enough to lift the embargo imposed on Libya, Iran, Iraq and Sudan and let it flow oil.
But the interest of America to Iraq's oil is not dictated by economics or energy policy.
The Bush administration has acknowledged that Iraqi oil is primarily a geopolitical asset.
That Iraqi oil control, control of Iraq.
Saddam had his power to the fact that he controlled the second world oil reserve.
He knew what he had to black gold.
Faced with the possibility of invasion and defeat, he threatened to fire to Iraqi oil fields.
The destruction and looting of Iraqi oil facilities and pipelines shows that almost everyone has realized that control the oil is to control the country.
During the preparation of the invasion by the US, securing oil fields was a priority.
The goal was not increased supplies and lower prices in the US market, but the overthrow of Saddam and its replacement by a new government.
The future of Iraq is linked to the country's oil production.
But given the vagaries of the oil market, especially in such a volatile situation, we do not see how the Bush administration will succeed in achieving its objectives in the coming years.
The problem is simple.
The US must use oil revenues to alleviate the financial burden of the Iraqi regime change based on US taxpayers.
In the long term, while reconstruction plan depends on the ability of Iraq to export large volumes of oil.
If Iraq does not produce oil, President Bush can keep his promises to the Iraqi people, the American people and the international community.
Before the invasion, Iraq had a production capacity of three million barrels of oil per day.
But it will return to that level of production in the time to establish an Iraqi government.
An increase in production requires the development of oil installations, which require large investments, a government in place and political stability.
Nobody, not even the Bush administration does not expect that these conditions are fulfilled soon.
Political stability is a precondition for increasing production capacity.
The experience of Iran, Kuwait, Russia, and even Iraq shows that it takes about three years of political stability before production capacity could increase significantly and sustainably.
It will take several years for Iraq to develop a new constitution establishing a democratic government, negotiate the distribution of oil revenues among different regions, regulate investment and make the economy attractive to foreign investors.
It also will take time to negotiate with the multinational oil companies and neighboring countries carrying out feasibility studies and technical studies needed as well as reconstruction, rehabilitation and exploration of its oil fields.
Also, even a 3-year period seems optimistic, for it assumes that during this time the occupation stops, Iraqis establish their own government and an end to political instability.
The reality may be different.
Important voltages may still be for years.
And it would not be surprising that Iraqi oil production may stop abruptly, even with a democratic government.
History shows that the strikes and social unrest could disrupt oil production occur more easily in a democratic context that under a dictatorship.
If Iraq is unable to increase its oil production in the next few years it will be a thorn in the side for both foreign policy for US energy policy.
How they will - they long-term finance the reconstruction of Iraq?
Who will pay to maintain a fragile democracy in Iraq?
The US can - they maintain their occupation without providing power to the Iraqi people, medical care and other basic services?
These are difficult questions, and we can not respond before a democratic regime does not control and guarantee the Iraqi oil production.
Leave deadly defend human rights.
If it was not so sad it would be macabre joke of the millennium: Libya was elected to chair the United Nations Commission on Human Rights!
When Caligula appointed his horse to the Senate, the horse at least did not have blood on his shoes.
Of course, the procedure was perfectly legal: the chairmanship rotates annually from one region of the world to another.
This year it was the turn of Africa to appoint the chairman and appointed Libya.
Only the United - States and Canada voted against.
In their infinite shame, European countries abstained.
This speaks volumes about the moral bankruptcy of the UN that this decision comes at a delicate moment for this organization.
President Bush challenged the UN to show their seriousness about their own mandatory decisions about Iraq: otherwise, they may suffer the same ignominious fate as the League of Nations, which proved powerless in the years 1930 when it was confronted with the aggressive policies of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.
The election of Libya to chair a United Nations agency responsible for enforcing human rights at present does little to support the legitimacy or moral authority of the world body.
Remember - that Libya is a totalitarian tyranny; its leader, Muammar Ghaddafi, combines sometimes changing behavior with extremist policies supporting dictators around the world.
He heads one of the most tyrannical regimes in the world, in which there is no sham election and where opposing views are instantly repressed.
Under his rule, Libya has supported terrorist organizations worldwide, from the IRA to the many Palestinian extremist groups.
She always incurs the UN sanctions for its role in the attack against a Pan Am flight - over Lockerbie, Scotland, there are ten.
During the last decade, the United Nations position as a symbol of the ideals of a peaceful world community has been regularly undermined.
They have proved completely unable to stop the war in the Balkans; and in at least one case, Srebrenica, UN Dutch forces to the peacekeeping remained there and witnessed the worst massacre in Europe after - war while the Bosnian Serbs massacred about 6,000 Muslims without defense.
A Dutch commission of inquiry later admitted that the UN Dutch battalion was, in fact, complicit in war crimes.
In Rwanda, when the genocide began, the United Nations representative for maintenance of peace operations ordered the evacuation of UN forces in the country, leaving the field open to the bloodiest genocide since World War II.
The name of the UN representative Kofi Annan.
It is a past depressing and pathetic that the United Nations are trying, probably in vain, to redeem by appearing in the Iraq crisis, as the voice of reason and international legitimacy.
But at a time when UN inspections in Iraq like sending the Army Hi to remove a bunch of gangsters, it may be that the election of Libya to head the Commission on Human Rights Man remains a historic date, that of the definitive failure of an organization whose creation had raised great hopes.
Organizations do not usually die, and certainly there are too many reasons of state for not ensuring that the United Nations will continue to hinder.
But they will be a mere shadow of what they should and could be.
The United Nations today give hypocrisy a bad name.
Supporters of authority are there.
Last Thursday, the judges of the Central Jakarta District Court in Indonesia sentenced me to one year in prison.
I am guilty, in my capacity as editor of Tempo Weekly Newsmagazine, the court said, defaming Tomy Winata, a business tycoon, for sub - heard his possible involvement in a fire in the textile market of Asia south - east of Jakarta and of fomenting riots by disseminating lies.
My case and other similar cases portend - they once again the end of a brief democratic experiment in Indonesia?
"The riot" that I have fomented occurred in March last year, when nearly 200 thugs claiming Winata attacked the Tempo office, threatening to burn down the building, harassed staff and wounding a reporter.
To try to resolve the situation peacefully, I was persuaded to go and negotiate at the central police station in Jakarta and found there, horrified, as the clique leaders took power at the police station.
I was struck with fists and kicks while the police left to do.
Fortunately, many journalists came to our rescue with tape recorders and cameras to record the events.
The dissemination of these images sparked public outrage and forced the parliament to open a public inquiry.
Officials of the National Police and the Jakarta Police were called and, because of the strong pressure of public opinion, the leaders of this gang were charged.
But Winata himself - even escaped the police investigation simply by publicly stating that his supporters acted without informing and without his consent.
He sued him - even afterwards, against Ahmad Taufik, the author of the article, Teuku Iskandar Ali, the editor, and I - well.
The trial hearings that lasted a year were marked by a series of suspicious developments all support Winata.
First, the case mounted by the police and the prosecutor contained documents so blatantly falsified that the police indicted two officers.
But the court rejected our request to suspend hearings until the clarification of the legality of the prosecutor's case.
The case against the officers involved appears to lead nowhere.
On the contrary, one of them was promoted to head the new unit anti - terrorist Jakarta newly created (and funded by the United - States).
The other says - on, was referred to the police academy to receive specialized training.
Then, after six months of hearings, the senior judge of the three-judge panel was suddenly promoted to head of a city court an hour from Jakarta.
One of my lawyers noted that in 35 years of practice in court, he had never seen a senior judge to be replaced during the case.
In fact, despite her promotion, the judge continued to preside over another case in the same building.
A judge who once ruled against Tempo in the civil lawsuit filed by Winata came to replace it.
Finally, Winata, during his testimony, presented false testimony denying being interviewed by Tempo.
A recording of the telephone conversation was broadcast during the hearings, the journalist who conducted the interview and the two writers who were present testified under oath, the telephone company produced official documents proving that phone call as evidence of its existence and the experts attested that the voice recording was that of Tomy Winata.
However, the judges rejected the request Tempo requesting the arrest of Winata for trial for perjury and we advised to file a complaint with the police, something that we did.
The judges then denied our request for deferment of the decision of the court until the case of perjury Mr. Winata to trial.
Considering all these flaws, my conviction and my prison are not surprising.
But I remain hopeful of winning in the end when the call Tempo will be referred to higher authorities.
Senior Indonesian courts are more ethical and director of the Supreme Court is a staunch defender of democracy and freedom of expression. The Tempo case could become a landmark for our democracy, like the famous decision of the Supreme Court of the United - States in the case of New York Times against Sullivan.
Having met the threshold of tolerance in the defamation charges against this decision allowed the American press hold to account those responsible for public affairs.
No country knows better than Indonesia that freedom of expression and freedom of the press are proven indicators of democratic development and that criminalizing journalists is an early symptom of authoritarianism.
Indonesia was a liberal democracy in the 1950s, before the muzzling of the press by President Sukarno, aided by the military junta in 1956.
Any criticism was stifled, the consolidation of power against power was not easy, and in July, 1959, Sukarno was able to declare the beginning of the "enlightened democracy".
For the first few years after the fall of Sukarno in 1966, all the benefits of genuine democracy, including freedom of the press, were restored (except for the communists).
Yet the regime of President Suharto also embarked on the muzzling of the press in early 1970, suspending various newspapers and jailing many journalists.
The muzzled press, other political rights were quickly denied and Indonesian democracy disappeared again.
Since the fall of Suharto in 1998, Indonesia has become the third largest democratic country in the world and the largest democratic Muslim community in history.
Free, fair and peaceful elections were held twice for the election of parliament and the direct election of the President, including the last Presidential election, proving the co - possible existence between Islam and democracy.
The enemies of democracy, however, never rest.
Extremist Islamic groups have engaged in bombings indiscriminately, while groups with pronounced authoritarian tendencies have made a breakthrough in circles close to President Megawati.
But Madame Megawati has just lost the recent Presidential elections.
Susilo, the newly elected President, he will continue to persecute journalists?
My conviction, and the trials and convictions of other journalists, it will mark the beginning of the end of the third Indonesian democracy hard-won?
The answer lies in the support that Indonesian Democratic activists can generate domestically and internationally.
Losing Indonesia, potential beacon of hope to all democrats activists in the world Muslim community, would be a terrible defeat.
The moral of the death penalty.
A frequent criticism of states - united their refusal to abolish the death penalty.
Many now claim that abolition of capital punishment is a precondition of a civilized system of criminal law.
The Nobel laureate Gary Becker is not of this opinion.
European governments are adamantly opposed to capital punishment - the European Union bans it outright, and some Europeans consider its use to the States - United succession barbarism.
In fact, many European intellectuals argue that capital punishment, but punishment in general, does not deter criminals.
But while the Europeans, with crime rates well below those of States - States in the last half - century, could long afford to be relatively "gentle" with regard to most crimes, he saw their crime rates increase sharply during the past twenty years.
In contrast, American rates have fallen in part due to the increased use of punishment.
Capital punishment is one.
I am for the execution of some people convicted of murder because, and for that reason alone, I think it deters other murders.
If I did not believe that, I would oppose capital punishment, because revenge and other possible motives should not be a basis for public policy.
Serious empirical research on capital punishment in the States - States began with a study by Isaac Ehrlich, published in 1975 in the American Economic Review.
Some studies that have followed have sometimes found a much weaker deterrent effect, others a much stronger effect.
However, the available data are quite limited, so it should not base any conclusions solely on the econometric evidence.
Obviously punishment in terms of public policy can not expect perfect evidence.
But even with the limited quantitative evidence available, good reasons to believe in the deterrent effect of capital punishment is sufficient.
Most people, and murderers in particular, fear death, especially when it follows swiftly and with the commission of a murder.
As David Hume put it in discussing suicide, "no man ever threw away life, while it was worth living.
This is our natural horror of death "... Likewise, Schopenhauer believed that" when the horrors of life reach the point at which they outweigh the terrors of death, a man puts an end to his life.
But the terrors of death offer considerable resistance "...
Opponents of capital punishment frequently proclaim that the state has no moral right to take anyone's life would be - that that of the most reprehensible murderer.
Yet it is a conclusion quite wrong to think that the death penalty is a deterrent.
To see why, suppose that for each murderer executed (instead of, say, be sentenced to life in prison) the number of murders is reduced by three, which is a much lower number than Ehrlich and other estimates of the deterrent effect.
This implies that for each murderer not yet executed, three innocent victims would die.
In fact, the government would "take" indirectly many lives if it did not resort to the death penalty.
Saving three innocent lives for every person executed seems like a very attractive, and even two lives saved per execution seems like a cost / benefit persuasive for the death penalty.
However, it must be admitted that the argument in favor of capital punishment becomes less clear when the number of lives saved per execution falls.
But even if one life were saved per execution, the market may still be desirable if the life saved is much better than the life, which is generally the case.
Many people object to comparing the quality of life spared and that which is deleted.
Yet I do not see how to avoid such a comparison.
Take the case of a career criminal who robs and kills a victim who led a decent life and left several children and a spouse behind.
Suppose it is possible to save the life of an innocent victim by executing a criminal like this.
It seems to me that saving the life of such a victim must outweigh take life of the criminal.
Obviously, not all cases are not as clear, but a comparison of the qualities of individual lives must be part of any reasonable social policy.
This is also why the death penalty should be used only for murders, and not for lesser crimes.
When it comes to choosing between taking lives and, say, reducing property theft, the more lenient punishment of the thesis is much more powerful.
Although severe assaults, including some gruesome rapes, may approach some murders in severity, and might conceivably call for capital punishment, I'm not for use in such cases.
One argument for reserving capital punishment for murders is "marginal deterrence."
If assault were punished with the death penalty, would push the attackers to kill their victims to avoid discovery (which is a major reason for the severity of the punishment is proportionate to the gravity of the crimes).
One complication, however, could be a murderer fight over pugnacity to avoid being captured, which could lead to more deaths.
But, while marginal deterrence is important, I believe the resistance of murderers to being captured, possibly at the expense of their own lives, is really indirect evidence that criminals do fear capital punishment.
Of course, the risk of executing the innocent concern.
My support for capital punishment would weaken greatly if the rate of killing innocent people were as large as many claim.
However, I believe that the appeal process in the States - United offers enormous protection, not so much against wrongful conviction as against wrongful execution, which means that there is very little, if at all, case of executed people it is proved that they were innocent.
And this has been strengthened enormously with the development of DNA identification.
I say again that the debate on the death penalty is a debate on the power of deterrence (which may be reduced by lengthy appeals).
I can understand that some people are skeptical about the evidence, although I think they are wrong about this as well as on the question of common sense of the problem.
It is very disturbing to take someone's life, even that of a murderer, but sometimes highly unpleasant actions are necessary to prevent even worse behavior causing the death of innocent victims.
The people against Putin.
I have contributed to the choice of Vladimir Putin to succeed the first democratically elected president, Boris Yeltsin.
Since structures such as the KGB and the Mafia now run Russia and manipulate the judicial system, it is assumed that Yeltsin wanted to choose him - even his successor in order to avoid prosecution.
But we who chose Putin were charged with finding a successor able to continue the reforms initiated by Yeltsin, and not someone who would protect him and his family.
Yeltsin was fearless and did not think about his own survival, but the survival of the democratic idea that he introduced to Russia.
Yet this idea is now threatened by the successor we chose him.
I am not trying to deny responsibility for my support for Putin.
We were not close friends, but he and I worked together in critical situations, and I never doubted his sincerity.
Putin acts according to his convictions.
The problem is that his convictions, including the belief that Russia can prosper only if it is led by a single source of power, are erroneous.
And that mistake is now leading Russia to its political ruin.
Obviously, no one can hold a position of high responsibility without committing mistakes, even fundamental errors, and this is especially true when times are troubled.
Yeltsin was no exception to the rule, but he acknowledged his mistakes.
When he retired on 31 December 1999, he asked pardon for having triggered the war in Chechnya.
Putin, by contrast, seems incapable of recognizing and admitting his mistakes, and persists in a policy long after its failure becomes obvious to the whole world.
One of Yeltsin's errors was his failure to put moral priorities at the head of his reform agenda.
Russia should have repented of Stalinism and the Gulag system.
The entire nation, without exception, should have repented, as the Germans have done since 1945.
This failure account because it allowed the unconditional faith in Putin central authority leads to a new state capture by the security services.
Indeed, a direct result of national repentance should have been the banning of the communist party and the disqualification from political office of those who worked for the KGB.
Although such policies are not simple sorting in post - communist societies where victims and collaborators were so numerous, and the border between the two sometimes so blurred, a viable solution could be found, as in the Czech Republic.
The choice of doing nothing left the Russian security structures unscathed and able to return to the political scene, what they have achieved today.
The political resurrection of KGB structures under Putin, and their efforts to silence dissent, has once again turned Russia into a country of defectors.
It is impossible to silence politicians and independent media without stifling independent sources of money, which explains the Kremlin Putin has concentrated its attacks on the so - called "oligarchs."
The arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his trial were orchestrated for precisely this reason.
By removing independent sources of money, the security services that dominate the Kremlin hope to destroy independent political life in Russia.
Without independent bases of thought, it is a climate of fear sets in.
But fear is not only degrading, it does not govern well.
Yeltsin intuitively understood that fear and centralized and top-down decision could be the right way to run a modern country, and had therefore insisted reforming relations between citizens and the state.
Putin still does not understand that a centralized political system is as incapable of comprehending and correcting mistakes now as it was in Soviet times.
Without a solid education, Putin, quite genuinely, train leading Russia to the same decay as that accompanied the collapse of the Soviet state.
The people began to realize it.
He noted that Putin's desire to create a strong and effective modern state can not be realized because a modern state is governed not from above, but by informed citizens who force their leaders to recognize and correct their mistakes.
Putin, too, seems to suspect his regime's impotence.
It's one of the reasons that made Russia so aggressive with its neighbors, Ukraine and Georgia, and that cause it to maintain a military presence in places like Transdniestria, the breakaway region of Moldova.
By winning in the neighboring regions of Russia, the Kremlin thinks he can persuade the Russians of his omnipotence.
As the debates in Russia are castrated and that the Kremlin is able to manipulate the elections, regime change is the only solution remaining to preserve it the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdemocracy.
It is futile to cling to illusions.
Those who oppose Putin must decide what they want and say that if the regime fails to uphold the constitution, they have the right to require them to do by any means.
Today, the question of power in Russia can no longer decide the polls.
As in Ukraine, Lebanon and Kyrgyzstan, it will decide on the street.
Impose and spend (SVP).
Excessive taxation can dull incentives and hinder growth.
But insufficient taxation can also produce the same effects.
Governments with meager tax revenues can not provide basic public goods.
Worse yet, low tax revenues in poor countries often the result of shortcomings in the tax collection systems (rather than low tax rates) that also promote non-productivity.
India illustrates the importance of a well-designed tax system.
In Bangalore, high-tech companies have built world-class campus teeming with manicured lawns and ultra data communication networks - faster.
Outside these campuses, however, lie open sewers, uncollected garbage, and roads in disrepair.
Whereas technology companies instantaneously transmit terabytes of data to remote continents, local transport proceeds at an almost medieval pace.
Therefore, businesses in Bangalore run their own bus services, sub - contract with private suppliers for drinking water, and install generators to protect against power failures.
The state can not fix the shambles because it is broke.
Government debt in India exceeds 70% of GDP, so that more than half of its tax revenues go to paying interest.
But the debt is not the result of excessive spending in the past.
Government spending in India account for about 15% of GDP, against an average of about 40% of OECD GDP.
The financial difficulties of India rather because a tax system poorly designed and managed.
The rates and rules for taxes on individual and corporate income taxes appear reasonable by international standards.
Nevertheless, the government of India imposes taxes on income accounting for only about 3.7% of GDP, about half that of South Korea and other Asian tigers.
Agriculture in India accounts for about a quarter of GDP, but even wealthy farmers do not pay taxes.
Exporting companies in the software and other industries industry benefit from a tax holiday on their profits, although their employees pay taxes on their personal income.
Despite reasonable rates, tax evasion is widespread.
Fraud is explained by the fact that the government has not invested in personnel or in the systems to detect tax evaders, who rarely go to prison and that can often get out of pots pouring matter - of - wine when they are caught.
Even more subtly, the loophole taxes "direct" on incomes and profits reflects the mess to the "indirect" system of taxes levied on the production and consumption.
Excise taxes account for over 60% of indirect taxes in India, which in turn represent the same proportion of its total tax revenue.
The right to basic excise duty was fixed at 16% of the production value of a company.
Then follow various discounts, exemptions and surcharges.
For example, a "duty rate concessional" of 8% is levied on categories like food products, matches, cotton son and computers.
A "special excise duty" Additional 8% is levied on products that include polyester filament, cars, air conditioners and tires.
A "right of additional excise duty" (not to be confused with the "special excise duty") is levied on "goods of special importance."
The exemptions from excise duties are many and complex, including businesses with total annual revenues of less than 10 million rupees and firms located in certain troubled or backward areas.
Generally, exemptions are divided into 70 major categories, they - same sub - divided into 259 entries, 52 conditions, and 7 lists, each containing many elements.
Exemptions encourage abuse.
For a price, officials at the bottom of the hierarchy, which shows considerable discretion in applying the conditions, can be induced to give favorable interpretations.
Products taxed at high rates (for example, polished granite) are sold as goods taxed at lower rates (for example, as unpolished granite).
Evasion of excise taxes is more contagious than evasion on profits and revenues.
If a company fraud excise duties and the tax rate is high compared to pre-tax profits in the industry, its competitors also have to cheat just to survive.
While fraud increases, governments levy "additional" or "special" rights inciting further evasion.
Perceptions of direct taxes also suffer.
The pot - of - Wine paid to the collector of excise duty for a favorable classification, the difference between the value of polished and unpolished granite, and the real income underreporting create "black" funds that can not not be reported on income tax forms.
In addition to weaken the ability of the state to provide essential public goods, systems to evade indirect taxes also discourage businesses from adopting more productive technologies, which requires technologies involving a large-scale deployment .
But as indirect taxes can be more easily bypassed by deploying several small units instead of one large unit, it is impossible to achieve economies of scale.
It is important to note that in the software industry, where all units are exempt from indirect taxes, Indian companies operate at efficient scale.
India could - it follow the example of China, the country where the rationalization of indirect taxes in 1994 set the stage for a great boom?
Or coalition governments in a vigorous democracy are - they are incapable of such reform?
Last year, the government led by the BJP of India has enacted legislation allowing for substantial reductions in the budget deficit.
He then appointed a task force to formulate the necessary changes to the policies of public spending and tax policies.
Last July, the task force proposed raising taxes (rather than cutting spending) by removing most indirect tax exemptions, among other things.
The new government led by the Congress of India also seems to favor these proposals.
If Congress and the opposition parties follow, they will help a lot to support the country's economic growth and in dispelling the idea that democracies can not take the necessary measures to encourage development.
What is wrong with Turkey?
On December 16, Orhan Pamuk, one of Turkey's most famous writers, will face an Istanbul court. He must answer charges of "insulting the national identity" for speaking out in favor of an open discussion on the Turkish genocide of 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 and 1916.
Pamuk faces three years in prison.
Turkey's efforts to impose fines and prison sentences for those who toe the official line convinces me that I was right to oppose the opening of negotiations on its accession to the European Union .
In December 1999, the European Council granted Turkey the status of EU candidate country, which meant that Turkey would enter the Union on a future date not yet fixed.
The Council then asked the European Commission to decide by October 2004 whether Turkey fulfills the political criteria for membership, which include democracy, the rule of law and respect for the rights of ethnic minorities.
This decision was one of the last taken by Romano Prodi's Commission, of which I was a member.
Among its 30 members, 29 said that Turkey fulfilled the criteria sufficiently to proceed.
I was the lone dissenter.
This is the same Commission report on Turkey, prepared by G√ºnter Verheugen, then in charge of the enlargement of the EU, which motivated my decision.
This report mentioned that in 2003 some 21,870 Turks submitted asylum in the EU, of which 2127 were accepted.
In other words, the governments of the EU self - acknowledged in 2003 that the Turkish government had persecuted more than 2,000 of its own citizens.
In the meantime, the Commission published a progress report on Turkey that granted that reforms were continuing, albeit at a slower pace, under the government mildly Islamic-minded Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Yet the report also presented serious misgivings: human rights violations, including torture, continued; the military's influence remained too high; freedom of speech was not universally observed; religious minorities non - Muslim and cultural were victims of discrimination and violence against women was not opposed strongly enough.
The situation has not changed much since that discussions on accession began in October.
In - Beyond the persecution of Pamuk is currently the victim, unacceptable behavior abounds.
In March 2005, the police violently disrupted a demonstration to celebrate International Women's Day.
In May, the largest teachers' union was banned for promoting the education of 14 million Turkish Kurds in their own language.
It is undeniable that intolerance reached to the heights of the Turkish government.
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul recently canceled abruptly a press conference in Copenhagen when he spied a Kurdish journalist in the audience and the Danes refused to evict him.
Such acts and such attitudes amply justify my dissent of October 2004.
But even if these shortcomings were removed, Turkey should still not be admitted to the EU because it is not a European country.
Christianity, feudalism, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, democracy, and industrialization have made us what we Europeans are, but they have not made Turks who they are.
I am not convinced that reforms in Turkey implemented at the insistence of the European Commission would continue after accession.
I suspect that there will be backsliding.
In addition, the accession of Turkey would lead surely to that of Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, and can - be Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
These top three countries are certainly more European than Turkey.
Leaving aside the three Caucasus republics but including the successor states to Yugoslavia, this would mean an EU of some 35 members.
What sort of Union would be - what?
The EU is not simply a club of friends.
It is based on the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.
The Commission, as guardian of the EU treaties, must protect these four fundamental freedoms, which means that it must sometimes persuade, and if necessary force, states - members to change their laws.
Alcohol related policies in Sweden, the law - Volkswagen in Germany and discrimination against foreign investment funds in France are examples of cases that made the Commission unpopular.
But they were necessary.
By the time I left the Commission, I had a - before me a stack of 1500 irregularities findings of this style.
In short, EU membership implies acceptance of incisive measures that deeply affect a state's internal affairs.
That will be impossible with such disparate members.
The EU would fall victim to what the historian Paul Kennedy calls "imperial overreach."
It would dissolve in an unacceptable manner.
That is why former French President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing feared that Turkey's entry would lead to the end of the EU, and it is why former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said: "The accession of Turkey would be more than the EU could bear."
But the strongest reason to oppose Turkey's accession is a question of democracy: the majority of the EU population does not want simply.
The Bolivian crisis, failure of Latin America.
Bolivia is not a typical country in Latin America, far from it.
And if that was Haitian disorders, it would be the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere: it is even less stable Haiti as shown by its history and its two hundred coups since independence.
In a region with a strong indigenous past but a scattered and isolated present, Bolivia is can - being, with Guatemala, the only country in Latin America where indigenous peoples make up the majority of the population.
Topography and ethnic distribution are generating autonomist and even secessionist force that threaten national unity in more menacing ways than anywhere else.
And it is, of course, with Paraguay, the only country in the entire sub - continent private access to the sea.
Thus, it would be unwise to extrapolate the current crisis in Bolivia to the rest of Latin America.
The generalization would be too simplistic institutions elsewhere are much stronger, poverty, especially extreme poverty has been reduced and the battle over natural resources has been largely settled.
Even in countries such as Venezuela, which has huge oil reserves and has a nationalist government in the traditional spirit, the status quo maintained allowed the preservation of foreign investment during the nearly eight years of government President Hugo Chavez.
While the existence of indigenous movements is a reality in many countries, from Chiapas to the "Araucania," the Amazon to Ayacucho, they have never posed any real threat to national integrity no country in Latin America.
Thus, Bolivia does not live a premonitory crisis, nor the eternal "domino theory", to which Lyndon Johnson and Che Guevara both believed in the case of Bolivia, seem valid or even partially reasonable.
Yet the current crisis in Bolivia points to the "democratic deficit" that plagues Latin America.
Elected leaders are defeated for one reason or another in Bolivia, Ecuador and Haiti.
Democracy is faulty or missing in Cuba, Mexico and Nicaragua and sees pure threatened one reason or another in Venezuela and Colombia.
None of these cases is not like the other, and they all have different degrees of danger, destruction and reconciliation.
The question is what can be done against this state of affairs, which contrasts starkly with the encouraging outlook that prevailed until recently.
At the last meeting of the Organization of American States, held in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the delegation States - United borrowed a good idea provided by others and simply casting due to support.
The story began two years ago when Dante Caputo, former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Argentina, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) were commissioned to prepare a report on democracy in Latin America.
Their findings indicated that an early warning system for democratic crises in the region would help generate some actions before any loss of control, as is the case of Bolivia today.
Caputo and the UNDP team had then convinced Chilean President Ricardo Lagos to take over the initiative and promote it with several of his colleagues.
What he did without the initiative did not get very far.
In fact, the UNDP report on democracy in Latin America, published in 2004, barely mentioned.
States - States and the new Secretary General of the OAS, Jose Miguel Insulza, have revived during the OAS meeting in Florida, but was killed by the reasonable concerns of Latino - American persuaded that s' This is an action against Venezuela, associated with anachronistic fears of Latino - American on the violation of sacro - saint principle of non-intervention.
Despite the inability of the continent to agree on the principle, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan early warning system is worth studying.
Today, the Latin - American community probably has little possibility of intervention on the situation in Bolivia, and yet it is dangerous for everyone.
Evo Morales, the leader of the opposition and the growers of coca leaves, may - be an honest democratic leader, somewhat misguided, but his fans are - they all released from any authoritarian control?
Hugo Chavez finance can - not be Morales and other Bolivian dissidents, but are Venezuela and Cuba - they not tempted to meddle in the affairs of this country where Che Guevara died at the head of the guerrillas almost 40 years earlier?
Santa Cruz business community in Bolivia can not give - be it following its secession threats but prefer - they share the reserves of oil and natural gas in their area with indigenous highland peoples rather than Brazilian industrialists from S√£o Paulo?
Before the events are extreme, it might - be good for the OAS (not the states - States) is involved.
The region continues to need that involvement in terms of time, message and flat - appropriate democratic form, distinct from the traditional US intervention and usual indifference of Latin America.
The decline of France?
The French are notoriously sensitive, if not defensive, about the size of France abroad.
The French state spends a significant amount to the spread of French language and culture, but the French are painfully aware that the global position of their country is not what it was.
In this context it is not surprising that in the last presidential elections, the publication of a report by the European Commission declaring that the economic rank France among the European countries had increased from 3.
The OECD and Eurostat, the European body to gather this data, thought to have ended this aspect of the debate by showing that France, Germany, Italy and Great - Britain all had living standards about the same per capita.
But the controversy to a larger scale has not disappeared.
Anxious rumors of the "French decline" have reappeared with protest marches that took place this year against the pension reform, the growing disputes over fiscal policy with the European Commission and bickering with America on Iraq war.
The non-fictionalized book that was very successful in France at the moment is a polemic written by Nicolas Baverez, La France falls.
Baverez's book is filled with quotations from de Gaulle and Napoleon.
According to the author, the latest achievements of France back to the 1970s, with the fast train, the TGV, and Airbus.
He severely criticized Mitterrand and Chirac together by a "common talent to win elections and turn France into a loser."
The success of the book is in it - even a sign of "malaise".
But what kind?
Degeneration of the evidence from Baverez are not as convincing he wants to believe.
For example, he cites the exhaustion of industrial jobs as the most glaring evidence of the decline of France.
But deindustrialization is a reality common to all advanced countries.
Indeed, France actually gets better results than most of its competitors and rich neighbors, unlike Germany, the UK or the United - States, it has preserved the same global market share in the sector industrial than it had at the beginning of the 1970s.
Furthermore, using a more accurate measure of competitiveness and foreign investment, France achieves excellent results in these areas.
According to a recent report published by the Economic Analysis Council, direct investment in France rose to 60 billion euros in 2001, almost twice as much as Germany.
The French cost competitiveness also improved (20%) in the last three decades, higher productivity offsetting rapid wage growth.
But the heart of the economic problems in the long term of France lies precisely in the fear of losing industrial jobs.
France remains a strong industrial power in traditional sectors such as automotive and aerospace, but fell behind in innovative markets where smaller companies spread new technologies.
France, for example, spends only $ 30 billion per year in research and development of advanced technologies, against $ 51 billion for Germany, $ 98 billion for Japan and $ 265 billion for states - States.
In short, the analysis of Baverez share in the wrong direction.
France has undertaken a number of extremely important reforms over the last two decades: economic and financial liberalization, elimination of price and exchange controls, the end of credit restrictions, European liberalization, reduced inflation and trade deficits, the advent of the euro and the forced globalization of the country's businesses.
The French malaise has certainly not been induced by these reforms.
The problem of France has it failed to recognize the new world she is already.
French capitalism is dead and France can not accept his death.
France must be the only country in which a prime minister, Lionel Jospin, felt obliged to apologize after saying on TV that "the State is not all - powerful."
There are several reasons for this French schizophrenia, but the most important of these concerns the politics of the past 20 years.
Until 1981, France was clearly divided between right and left.
Since that time, the Mitterand and Chirac administrations blunted their ideological side to implement the difficult process of adaptation to Europe and globalization.
A "shock therapy" on Mrs. Thatcher two decades ago might have forged a new political consciousness.
But the slow and consensual transition reforms allowed the French to live in a world and think in another.
This fact largely political cataclysm that exploded during the last presidential campaign, when the leader of the extreme right Jean - Marie Le Pen reached the second round of presidential elections to incumbent Prime Minister Lionel Jospin .
The rise of the extreme left, which gathered 10% of the votes in the presidential campaign, also attests to this political failure.
France needs a lot more than an economic revolution political revolution if it is to come to terms with reality, especially the fact that the "French decline" is a fear created by the French people.
The value of European values.
European leaders have taken the constitutional discussions that ended last December following a dispute about voting rights.
These debates are obviously lead to compromise, which will be soon.
Remains to understand clearly what the supposed objectives of the Constitution.
Two fundamental principles guided European integration: solidarity and subsidiarity.
These two principles are at the crossroads of philosophy, politics, economics, sociology and law.
For years, they have been an integral part of the legal and institutional structure of the European Union in the Treaties, the Charter of Fundamental Rights (which quotes them in the Preamble) and in the recent avant - draft Constitution.
In short, they are recorded in the history and the EU ideals.
But what is the real significance of these two principles?
Consider solidarity, which is open to two interpretations minimum: static solidarity, which concerns only the distribution of income and wealth, and the broader concept of dynamic solidarity, which concerns the production of income and wealth.
In the history of post - war European integration, dynamic solidarity was strongly manifested during the first period, that of the European Coal and Steel Community, both in its economic development strategy (reconstruction ) than in the Treaties, particularly the Treaty of Rome.
This does not mean that dynamic solidarity was subsequently suppressed by: the European Monetary Union, for example, perfectly expresses this principle.
Thus, although some countries did not immediately benefit from the euro, they nevertheless accepted because they were convinced that it would have positive effects on the long term.
In other words, the dynamic solidarity means promote policies that encourage investment, innovation, economic growth and employment.
However, as indicated GDP growth in the EU, dynamic solidarity has been undermined over the last decade.
The gap between research and development is of particular concern.
The implementation of the so - called Lisbon Strategy of the EU, adopted in 2000 with the promise to create the most competitive economy in the world, is threatened by the growing emphasis on static solidarity, reflected the high cost of welfare and high taxes needed to finance it.
The primacy of static solidarity is due to an aging population, along with slower growth, has led to structural fiscal imbalances.
One of the biggest challenges to the future of the EU is to address the current prevalence of static solidarity, which is geared towards the elderly, at the expense of dynamic solidarity, which promotes youth.
After all, the Union can not allow the current consumption continues to prevail over the investment needed for future prosperity.
Subsidiarity is similar to the concept of solidarity in that its interpretation is twofold: the vertical subsidiarity and horizontal subsidiarity.
Vertical subsidiarity concerns the distribution of powers between the different levels of government and sovereignty: the EU, national states, regions and municipalities.
The best known application of this principle is federalism.
The European treaties clearly express this vertical subsidiarity.
But - it enough to encompass the emerging institutional and constitutional framework of the Union?
Horizontal subsidiarity concerns the responsibility and freedom of human beings as well as social and economic powers.
It encompasses the relations between state, society and the market.
But society and the market have their own rights and their own sovereignties that are not granted by the state.
Then there arises the following problem: how to ensure the autonomy of each realm?
An example of horizontal subsidiarity internal European market, which has created a new kind of economic freedom and increased competition between businesses by eliminating the protection as national governments offered them.
Horizontal subsidiarity means that in society and in the economy, the state can not violate individual freedom and responsibility, which must be observed at the highest possible level.
It also implies that a "higher power" must support whenever individual freedom and responsibility are not enough to achieve the goals necessary for human dignity.
However, this support must be provided in ways that promote the natural potential of individuals, society and the market.
But this is possible only if the role of horizontal subsidiarity is clearly stated, which was not the case in the European Treaties, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, or the work of the European Convention.
To summarize, solidarity today involves redistribution rather than growth (this is how the current generation expresses solidarity with future generations), while subsidiarity concerns the distribution of political power rather than a conservative definition of boundaries between state, civil society and the market.
At present, these two values ‚Äã‚Äãare defined so as to promote the state.
Indeed, the emphasis on market-oriented growth has often been identified with the semi values ‚Äã‚Äã- Foreign of America.
But these values ‚Äã‚Äãare deeply rooted in Europe and must be uprooted again.
The EU should restore its economic vitality by pursuing a more balanced model of solidarity and subsidiarity in favor of the market and of society, which would diminish the influence of socio - economic state.
Public institutions must produce public goods (such as defense, justice, and fiscal and monetary policy), the company must provide social goods (like culture, education and aid to the needy) and the market must produce economic goods (linked to profits, growth and employment).
In the 21st century, Europe must reconsider the value of these two principles (solidarity and subsidiarity) if it is to achieve the historic goal of integration: freedom and well - being needed to overcome the differences and political divisions have led to tragedies in the 20th century.
This is the spirit in which is to be developed the European Constitution.
Policy values.
The debate about the American elections has still not abated.
How President George W. Bush was able to get three million more votes than Senator John Kerry, and, in addition, offer a Republican majority in both houses of Congress?
There is little agreement on the answers, but two themes recur in many explanations.
One of these themes is its personality.
In our time full of uncertainty and threat, people have placed their trust in a president they knew rather than a candidate who has not yet proven.
The second is that of values.
The citizens voted for a set of values ‚Äã‚Äãrather than for specific policies.
Indeed, some (say - we) agree with the policies of Kerry but nevertheless gave their vote to Bush because they felt "comfortable" with his entire attitude.
It is clear that States - States is now deeply divided in electoral terms.
An arch of blue states (Democrat) in the east, north and west extends around a huge red zone (Republican) in the center and south.
To - beyond the geographical division, divisions reproduce locally.
Gerrymandering, the practice tracing electoral boundaries to favor a political party over another is no longer necessary.
Voters tend to move to areas where the majority of people share their values, whether Republican or Democratic.
What exactly are these values?
These are the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat process, that we are told, "god, guns and gays."
Religion plays a role, especially with own truths to the Bible in the field of the history of creation.
Owning a gun is the ultimate test of individualism and the use of weapons in war is nothing obnoxious.
Gays and other "modern" practices are rejected as self-indulgent.
As the political scientist Andrew Hacker recently put it, "Bush candidacy was built to form a majority by giving 60 million voters a chance to feel good vis - a - vis self -".
All this is - he an American phenomenon, or there are other trends elsewhere?
One answer has it that as an American phenomenon, values ‚Äã‚Äãthe policy may well order a majority today, but is by no means general cases.
Europe and other parts of the world are divided in the same way.
Personality has no doubt and under the obvious political differences are also found issues of values ‚Äã‚Äãthat have not been highlighted.
But traditional political differences based on disagreement over fundamental values ‚Äã‚Äãplay a diminishing role in the elections.
Prime Minister Tony Blair, for example, another leader to face an election in his country, plays the card of personality and talks about policies, but is primarily a set of middle-class values.
When he speaks of "modernization" or "to enter the twenty-first century," he manages to suggest a strange but appealing mixture of change and stability.
This leaves the Conservative opposition without an effective response.
Even the issues of tax cuts and stricter asylum fail to fly over the strings of the melody of the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat the Republican Party has managed to hear States - States.
The situation is the same in Germany, where the influence of the political manifesto of values ‚Äã‚Äãis even lower.
The debate in Germany is still the most part a political debate.
When the opposition offers the government to negotiate the reform of the social security or, more recently, the fight against unemployment, the challenge under - lying is not posed in terms of values ‚Äã‚Äãbut rather skill.
Yet in the fields of traditional battles of English or German political debate, or elsewhere in Europe, the values ‚Äã‚Äãclashes threaten.
Parties fight for those who can "feel at home at their own place," but they can understand - not be that although this is only partly a matter of policy.
Religion will never be a major factor in European politics: public opinion polls show that religious practice remains one of the few major differences between Americans and Europeans.
The weapons also have a different place in European minds: it is their absence that Europeans regard as important.
Europe also saw without doubt a current pacifist values.
And politically correct issue (the "gays") plays a lesser role so far in Europe.
Above all, Europe itself - even divides Europeans, as the "national question" is present in all European countries.
It is a question of values ‚Äã‚Äãinspired by fear.
People want to know where they stand and, in the process, turn against the states - the United States and to Europe or against Europe and toward their country.
Anyway, then we leave the realm of political and even politics and enter the swampy area of ‚Äã‚Äãsymbols and myths.
This, in any case, is the main danger to which democracies are facing because the politics of values ‚Äã‚Äãis a dangerous development.
It reintroduces fundamental divisions of a company with the best democratic achievement was precisely to banish fundamentalism from politics.
Informed public debate should be a discussion on the policies contained by a community of values.
It is therefore essential to emphasize this key objective of the policy of freedom.
The advent of the interest.
One swallow does not make a summer, and one month of normal job growth and rising prices in the United - States does not mean that the Federal Reserve no longer fears economic malaise and deflation.
But the time will come when world interest rates begin to rise, as central bankers prepare to resist the wave of rising inflation.
When that time comes, whether the fall in 2005 or 2006, or in 2007, America and the world economy will face financial vulnerabilities that reflect the success of the last three years of monetary stimulation in stemming the decline in production and moderating unemployment.
Short-term interest rates are astonishingly low: only 2% in the euro zone, just 1% in the United - States and zero in Japan.
Expansionary monetary policy has proved to be a success, but only by pushing interest rates to historic lows and have convinced investors that borrowing costs will remain at their current levels for a long time.
The monetary stimulus has mainly had the effect of increasing asset prices: anything that produces a profit, a dividend or a rent becomes much more attractive, and therefore much more valuable in financial terms, when interest rates are very low and should remain so.
This explains the considerable differences between the current real estate prices in the United - States, common shares in New York, London and Frankfurt, and long-term bonds everywhere and what should be, conventionally, their core values.
That it will happen when central banks start raising interest rates?
In 1994, the increase in interest rates in the short term has led to an increase in rates over the long term (and a decrease in bond prices over the long term) of at least double that provided by models standard this year - there.
The interest rates of peripheral, developing economies have also increased much more than the rates in the advanced industrial countries.
The first danger for 2005 and future years, when world interest rates will rise, as is likely, is another wave of financial crises in emerging markets.
For countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Argentina, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, the record of the 1990s shows that the differences in interest rates can grow and capital flows s' reverse remarkably rapidly, regardless of the degree of benevolence with which the IMF officials and analyzes by major banks view a country's policies.
The differences in interest rates in emerging markets now are abnormally low.
International money flows, capital inflows to the States - United excepted, have not yet found at levels associated with "irrational exuberance," but there is a good chance for that to happen before interest rates begin to climb.
This is an alarming prospect, because if there is a lesson of the 1990s is that nobody should overestimate the stability of international financial flows.
The second danger springs from high asset values ‚Äã‚Äãwithin the advanced industrial core.
The dominant mode of thought within the Federal Reserve, which I fully support, argues that the revolution in information technology continues, the potential output in the United - States is still growing very rapidly and the output gap Thus relatively large.
This implies that interest rates will certainly remain low for a relatively long time.
In addition, confidence in the Federal Reserve is great and the last vestiges of the risk premium for inflation of the 1970s no longer have any interest rates.
Therefore, even after output levels return to their potential, interest rates will stay low by the standards of the 1980s and 1990s.
All this is, of course, good news for all those who hold assets such as bonds over the long term, stocks and real estate.
Indeed, the increase in asset prices over the long term was precisely to point of lowering interest rates: making bondholders and especially real estate owners richer, after all a boost expenditures.
But the bad news is that even if interest rates are expected to remain low for some time, they will not stay this low indefinitely.
The bottom line is that when interest rates rise, asset values ‚Äã‚Äãfall.
It was during these periods, particularly when asset values ‚Äã‚Äãfall rapidly and significantly, we discover exactly how good our central bankers in their main job: reducing financial volatility and promoting economic stability.
It was also during these periods that we discover how individuals holding long-term bonds, real estate or shares not because they hold the think current prices are attractive relative to the base price, but because their prices have increased in recent years.
This is a crucial question for policy makers, because those who bought the assets over the long term because the prices seemed to increase indefinitely are also those who will sell as soon as price trends seem to be reversing.
In particular, the trade deficit of the United - States suggests a massive instability if asset prices over the long term are expected to drop considerably.
It is certain that the challenges facing policy makers of the world's economic policies over the coming years different from those that they have faced since the collapse of the NASDAQ bubble.
The risks associated with inflation are probably less dangerous than those generated by collapsing output and the threat of deflation.
But as we learned in the 1990s, this does not mean that the coming challenges will be easier to solve.
Opposite Futures America.
I recently discovered an interesting fact: American economists who deal with international finance and American macroeconomists who are involved in the domestic economy have very different views - indeed, opposing - the consequences potential of the huge US deficit.
Economists of international finance consider that a financial crisis is possible, followed by a painful recession and can - be extended to the States - States.
Macroeconomists that deal with the domestic economy by contrast, see a forthcoming fall in the value of the dollar not as a crisis but as an opportunity to accelerate growth.
Macroeconomists who examine the domestic economy generally regard the situation as follows: at some point in the future, foreign central banks will be less inclined to continue their massive purchases of dollar securities to support the greenback.
When they cease their dollar-purchase programs on a large scale, the dollar will fall, and fall hard.
And from this point of view, if the dollar declines, US exports will become more attractive for foreign markets and the US labor market recovers, labor being redirected to the new export sectors booming.
The situation will be similar to that of Great - Britain when it abandoned its exchange rate peg and allowed the pound to depreciate relative to the Deutschmark, or what happened to the States - States in the late 1980s when the dollar depreciated against the pound, the Deutschmark, and - above all - against the Japanese yen.
Economists of international finance a far bleaker future.
They see the end of the dollar-purchase programs on a large scale by central banks not only lead to the decline of the dollar but also to a spike in US long-term interest rates, which will immediately fall in consumption households and throttle investment spending after a short period of time.
Certainly, international finance economists also see US exports benefiting as the dollar's decline but the lags in demand are such that the surge in exports will come a year or two after the decline in consumption and investment spending.
Eight to ten million people will move from the service sector and the construction sector in the import - export of goods, implying that structural unemployment will rise.
In addition, there will be - be a financial panic: large financial institutions with short-term bonds and long-term assets will have a difficult time weathering a large rise in long-term interest rates denominated in dollars.
This factor of inequality may cause some financial stress and bankruptcy just as easily as those caused during the Mexican crisis and East Asia in the 1990s or the Argentinean crisis of this decade because of currency assets Local and bonds in dollars that were held by banks.
When economists of international finance highlight this scenario, macroeconomists specialized in the domestic economy respond that it sounds like a case of incompetence on monetary policy.
Why should the Federal Reserve - they allow higher long-term interest rates when foreign central banks have ceased their dollar-purchase programs?
Should - not the Fed step in and replace them by purchasing US Treasury bonds in the long term, maintaining the long-term interest rates at a level conducive to full employment?
Economists of international finance usually respond that the Fed does not have the capacity to do so.
Forced to choose between full employment and price stability, according to them, the Fed will choose price stability, because its institutional memory of the 1970s and soaring inflation remains very powerful.
Thus, since the fall of the value of the dollar raises import prices and thus functions as a negative shock on the supply side in the economy, the Fed will have to raise, not lower rates interest and sell, not buy Treasury bonds.
Serious economists whom I respect enormously find themselves taking strong positions on opposite sides of this debate.
I'm not wise enough to give due to one or the other, but I know without a doubt which side I hope to see it wrong.
Poor students of Europe.
States - States, states pursuing misguided fiscal policies are penalized.
Their bonds sell at a discount compared to other best-managed states.
The debt service they must pay higher used to a certain degree of discipline against the temptation to spend now and pay later.
Of course, the discipline of the market is not perfect: the bond market does not "see" implicit future liabilities (like promised pension payments).
However, the application of that fiscal discipline, combined with the internal budget process each state has prevented the onset of fiscal crisis of major proportions States - United since the Great Depression.
Consider the case of Europe.
Before the advent of the euro, many southern European states were experiencing fiscal crises, producing waves of high inflation.
But with the introduction of the single currency, the road to solving a fiscal crisis through inflation has been closed, as the European Central Bank (ECB) monitors the monetary policy.
However, even if nations can no longer rely on inflation to solve their unbalanced finances, the single currency allows them to use the debt capacity that actually belong to other members of the European Union extend their spending sprees and postpone political accountability for periods of let the good times rolled.
It is to avoid the possibility that the EU created the Stability and Growth Pact: the government deficits should not exceed 3% of GDP.
Last week, the German government, formerly the European country most prudent and disciplined in the fiscal level, broke the rules of the pact for the fifth consecutive year, without really present (much) apology.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck signaled that he expected that the European Commission applies sanctions against Germany: the credibility of the pact would say - he, at stake if no action n ' was done.
Thus, Germany would not block sanctions this time, as was the case there are two and a half years.
But Steinbrueck also made it clear that he is only waiting for a purely symbolic sanctions in response to the budget deficit of 3.4% of GDP, not to penalties that would cost its government or economy.
The Stability and Growth Pact is not, or not yet in the process of operating in the manner intended.
What about - about market discipline?
The will of the German government to increase its debt and run bigger deficits is - it limited by the fact that the market recognizes and penalizes nations that allow their fiscal positions to weaken?
In a word, no.
The interest rates on sovereign debt in the euro twelve governments in the euro area are very similar.
So the market does not seem to care that countries have different potentials to generate exports financing the cash flow necessary to repay debt, deficit or different ratios / current or projected GDP.
Willem Buiter of the University of Amsterdam and Anne Sibert of the University of London believe that it is the acceptance of the ECB while the deficit in the euro area as collateral that has undermined the market's willingness to become the fiscal moderation controller.
As long as the marginal part of the German debt is used as collateral for a short-term loan or as the centerpiece of a repurchase transaction delivered to acquire cash, its value is much more likely to be determined by the terms on which the ECB accepts it as collateral than by its fundamentals.
Treatment with the ECB any debt this way as important source of liquidity reserves now any false differential analysis of long-term sovereign risk.
This is dangerous in the long term.
It is necessary to have both market discipline and sound fiscal management to have a reasonable chance to benefit from price stability in the long term.
Today fail to sanction by the market behavior that may become broken - neck, or the institutional levers that give a voice to future generations, and you are liable to suffer serious consequences - may - be not today or tomorrow, but someday, and for the rest of your life.
As time passes, the arrival of the single currency and the way that the euro has been implemented is generating more and more unease.
The policy of the entire eurozone in general is too deflationary.
The transfers to make the current currency bearable to regions that slow or are already in recession when the ECB applies a stricter policy are not made.
The institutional foundations of a stable fiscal policy over the long term are being eroded.
Now Buiter and Sibert convince us that the ECB is giving the market less scope to reward the thrifty and penalize the profligate than it should.
The earth does not move again, and it will not happen for a while.
But the ground under the euro may well become slippery if things do not change.
Milosevic and Hussein same trial, even farce.
Trials of war criminals were once serious business.
Remember - you photographs of Herman Goering and Rudolf Hess sitting glumly in the dock at Nuremberg.
Some Nazi leaders were even hanged after relatively short but fair trials.
Today, the trial of the vilest world leaders have become farce.
The trial of Saddam Hussein and his Ba'athist cronies are an uninterrupted series of awkward moments.
The defendants try one antic after another, and Hussein shows every form of contempt possible. The only thing he has not yet done is show her ass to the judge.
It is difficult to expect an outcome that will appear legitimate in the eyes of Iraqis or the world.
Meanwhile, the trial of Slobodan Milosevic has morphed into a funeral after four boring years of testimony and $ 200 million spent unnecessarily.
In Cambodia, the United Nations and the government have procrastinated for almost a decade about how to bring surviving Khmer Rouge figures in court.
The mass killers who took power in the twentieth century were doomed to being killed in popular revolts or tried for their crimes - at least if they do not die in power.
That can feel proud that the last communist leader of Romania, Nicolae Ceausescu, was executed with his wife without even the semblance of a fair trial?
The formal trappings of a real court always seem better than instant justice, even if the end result is also death.
Today there are two plausible ways to proceed against a deposed tyrant.
A nation can send its former leaders in court, as did the Argentines in the 1980s with the generals responsible for the disappearance of more than 5,000 of their fellow citizens.
At the international level, the Nuremberg model remains valid as an example to other trials, although under equivocal terms as the victorious powers sometimes impose liability for crimes, such as "crimes against humanity", which are not properly defined at the time they are committed.
There was a time when we could see the benefits of trial both national and international.
The trials in the country allowed the local community to give vent to his grief by participating closely in the process.
As judges and juries, the defendant's compatriots could also bring greater sensitivity to the assessment of guilt because they appreciated the tough conditions under which a deposed dictator made his decisions.
The trial of the generals in Argentina was a successful ritual in the painstaking transition from military junta to democracy, but the experience ended in a tearful questioned.
Even after conviction, the generals were sufficiently strong to exact a termination of the trials and then a pardon from the succeeding president.
Argentine politics is still embroiled in the legal consequences of the trial there twenty years.
Internationally, the decision of the UN Security Council to establish the International Criminal Tribunal for the former - Yugoslavia (ICTY) was also greeted with great confidence.
The ICTY did make several foundational decisions under the leadership of Antonio Cassese.
But then the judges had the misfortune of realizing their fondest dream: to judge the chief villain Slobodan Milosevic.
We can get a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow the Serbs would have handled Milosevic in a local trial.
A lot would have depended on the political party that controlled the court.
At the international level, the fear was not of too much politics but of too much law.
Milosevic's trial had to be more than fair, it had to be the emblem of justice of the UN.
Thus Milosevic was allowed to defend himself - even - serious mistake in terms of length and trial efficiency.
There is no limit to the number of people the prosecution called to testify about the same gruesome story of Serbian aggression and brutality.
It will take many months to determine the problem and why this scandal of a four-year trial.
My hunch is that the well-intentioned court officials were too influenced by the Commission of Truth and Reconciliation in South - African model touted in law schools as a desirable alternative to distributive justice.
During the trial the south - African, the most important question was not the future of the defendant but the past of the victims.
Every victim was encouraged to tell his story and the defendant listened.
In the case of massacres in the twentieth century, such storytelling can last decades.
Encourage victims to speak and then giving the defendant the right to monopolize the floor and block the proceedings by touting his merits as a political leader are the ingredients of a long session.
One of the lessons we have learned from the trial of Milosevic and Hussein is do not judge men or women to terminate their charismatic appeal.
They will turn the trial, particularly if they are allowed to defend self - and use the courtroom to vindicate their careers.
Tyrants should be tried only after they are clearly defeated.
Ironically, the fact that the Nuremberg Tribunal was led by representatives of the victorious and powerful was a bonus.
They were a constant reminder to Goering, Hess, and their henchmen that the Allies were in charge, that the Nazis were irreversibly defeated.
Punish the guilty, rather than shaping the way history would be written, was always the clear objective of the trial.
The tragedy of the trial of Milosevic and Hussein is that dot the "i" of the story are still missing and the story itself - the same is on the hot seat.
The consequent reluctance of charge gave rise to procedures, both national and international, that facilitated fantasies of vindication and return.
In the case of Saddam Hussein, that fantasy may yet become real.
The dividing line of the Iraqi economy.
All who analyze the Iraq sees a nation divided between the communities of Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds.
But there is an equally fundamental division, a division which contributes as much to the ongoing insurrection as sectarian strife and opposition to the military occupation led by the Americans, that the widening gap between rich and poor from Iraq.
When Iraq was liberated, most people, especially the poor, have to hope for a charismatic leader who would save them from the harsh realities of everyday life.
Raised in fear, they had no idea how democracy could apply to their society, or how groups of human rights and other civil rights organizations could help shape their coming soon.
Iraq quickly found himself facing a new social divide.
On one side were those who understood how to function in a democracy, attain power and realize own ambitions.
They learned to speak the language of democracy, gaining the same time money and influence, and to ensure the participation of independent organizations to defend their rights and privileges.
On the other side, however, there is a large population of powerless Iraqis, including widows, divorced or abandoned with no one to care for them, they and their children.
For those - there, democracy and human rights does not mean much.
They are uneducated, poor and sick.
Victims of an educational system that collapsed there for over ten years, they are not trained to find employment in Iraq's economy crumbling.
Under the yoke of Saddam, no effort was made to raise the living standards of the poor.
I visited the great Iraqi slums and found families living in homes barely covered with a roof, infested with insects everywhere, with open sewers flowing under their doors.
Night and day, they live in the dark.
Needing nothing less than food, decent housing and job prospects, these families wait for death, dreading the cries of their starving children.
When I met the women who live in those houses, they showered me with questions: democracy was - she give food and houses?
Prevent democracy - it's men beat their wives?
Democracy grant - she citizenship to their children?
They give - it the right to divorce the husbands who abandoned?
To all these questions, I answered "Yes."
Yes, democracy will give you the right to live in a decent home, the right to learn and work, and it will grant citizenship to children and equality between men and women.
But you have to work hard and make every effort to demand those rights.
To which they replied: "Saddam taught us to be jobless, silent and fearful for 35 years.
What can - we now? ".
In these destitute areas, where most Iraqis, people are prey to bitter temptations.
Many people are not within the reach of political or government leaders.
They fall easily into violence, theft and sabotage.
Poverty leads some to accept money in exchange for acts of terrorism, abetted by the promise of a false heroism that they could not operate during the long reign of Saddam.
Poverty has exacerbated the trauma of the violent history of wars and atrocities in Iraq, who annihilated the sensitivity of the people to murder.
Although the conditions of life in Iraq today leads many young men toward violence, I am convinced that we need only to provide decent jobs and housing to save them.
Jobs, in particular, help young people to forge new lives through serious work.
Do not use dummy jobs to make up the army of unemployed.
We must give people jobs that allow them to contribute positively to the country's reconstruction.
By nature, every individual seeks to prove himself useful to his own company.
But the culture that Saddam created convinced Iraqis that political connections are the only way to gain authority, money and knowledge.
Overcome such sentiments will take time and require a booming economy, which implies that the new Iraqi government must have limited powers to facilitate private sector growth while encouraging widespread understanding of democracy and human rights .
Religious groups are ready to participate in this process.
We can also rehabilitate the technocrats who served under Saddam, so that they have also a chance to serve their country.
Last but not least, we must provide loans to poor families to help them build a respectable life.
The government must - above all make every effort in convincing poor Iraqis of the value of democracy and freedom and the importance of the constitution in achieving their aspirations for a better life.
This will not be easy to achieve in a country where many people consider breaking the law an act of heroism.
We have yet we, the Iraqis learned that power should not be concentrated in the hands of a minority, and the establishment of justice requires to fight corruption in all its forms.
If the constitution is to operate as a guarantee of democracy, freedom and security, poor Iraqis must learn to make that fight their own.
The Islamist identity.
Wherever you direct your gaze today, Islam is used (and misused) as a political force.
Some Muslims use it as a call to action; many Muslims in the West (and other countries) perceive it as an "other" containment, and an "other" demanding exclusion.
As a Turk, I feel directly the two sides of the debate.
The reason why Islam is like a religion of "the other" to Western eyes is that the West has witnessed a systematic de-institutionalization of religion.
It is not religion that disappeared from modern Western life, of course, but rather the claims that religious institutions can issue individual behavior.
Religion in the modern world is more than ever a personal and spiritual experience.
However, a process of deinstitutionalization of religious experience also occurs within Islam.
The politicization of Islam supersedes the authority of the religious classes in Islam, the ulema.
As in the West, Islamic religious experience is becoming more personal.
The interpretation of religious texts by individual Muslims, including political activists, intellectuals and women, is a consequence of many.
Another example is the extension of religious knowledge, teachings of the Koran being abused and taken out of context to support political ends.
Who now decides what is legitimate and what is illicit in Islam?
Who has the authority to interpret religious texts?
Who can issue a fatwa or declare "jihad"?
Nowadays, activism and terrorism provide, or rather impose, a source of legitimacy.
Thus lay decide what it means or does not mean Islam, without the authority of religious schools and without specialized training.
Indeed, Islam today is primarily interpreted through political actors and cultural movements, not religious institutions.
This institutionalization has enabled Islam to move from being a local and national social bond to creator imaginary ties between all Muslims around the world who feel oppressed or displaced.
Islamism can unite adherents who were deeply divided: Sufi Muslim intellectuals and canonized Shariat of Muslim origin; Shiite and Sunni Muslims; conservative Saudi Arabia and revolutionary Iran.
Islam is also dynamic, its believers leaving rural areas for cities, including Western cities.
Many see this movement as negative and emphasize that these people are socially uprooted and they rock later in alienation and, for some, terrorism.
But social mobility is also a precondition for creating a modern outlook.
Of course, migration causes a feeling of distance among Muslims, if not a total break, from their social origins.
Their religious experience is so new, private theological institutions, community or public.
Religious experience instead becomes a form of social imagination within which they reconstruct a sense of belonging to Islam in an environment that is both new and strange.
This is not the distance from modern life, but proximity to this life that triggers a return to religious identity.
Indeed, the vast majority of radicalism manifested in groups which, by their experience of mobility and displacement, are familiar with secular Western ways of political thinking and urban living.
Confused by unfamiliar surroundings, these individuals cling to Islam becomes their only support.
But for this support to work, Islam must be liberated from its traditionally subservient attitude, passive and docile face of modernity.
By wearing a veil or beard, claiming the right to obtain places of prayer at work or school, and demanding special foods, Muslims identify themselves overtly as Muslims.
They inform the world that they are more zealous and meticulous in their religious observance that individuals who confine their religiosity to private life.
For example, non-Muslims generally consider the veil as a sign of the debasement and inferiority of Muslim women.
Shame, however, it has become for Muslims a sign of their positive affirmation of an Islamic identity.
Young Muslim women in Europe illustrate this transformation perfectly.
Girls who adopt the headscarf in French and German schools are closer, in many respects (namely youth culture, fashion consciousness, and language) to their classmates as their uneducated mothers who are forced to stay home.
In adopting the headscarf for the European public sphere, these girls are changing unintentionally symbol and the role of Muslim women.
This trend goes - beyond simple scarves.
All Western Muslims possess a double sense of belonging, a double cultural capital.
They are defined by their religiosity, but they also acquired universal secular knowledge.
Because they have this double cultural capital, they can circulate relatively freely between different activities and spaces (home, school, youth centers and urban space for recreation).
Being a Muslim and being Islamists are two different things.
Today is the change of a Muslim identity to an Islamist identity.
The religious self for individual Muslims pass the private realm to the public realm.
The question that remains for everyone is whether that search for identity can be satisfied with headscarves and wide public acceptance of Islamic religious practice, or if positive affirmation of Islam demands a more fundamental renunciation of modernity.
A New Era for Islamic Science?
For several hundred years, when science and mathematics were enjoying a period of great invention, one region of the world was different from the others.
Masters of these disciplines were revered there, medicine advanced quickly, and people are curious about how nature.
Surprising that this region was globally respected.
In the other half of the known world, scientists were punished, even killed.
Mathematics as irreligious and foreign, were off - the - law and was later made subservient to religion.
The standard of living was low.
The prosperous region was the Middle - Islamic East, while an ignorant Europe remained poor.
Both regions were religiously governed (historians disagree on the role and nature of religions in this context), but science flourished only in one of them.
Today, of course, the roles of the Middle - Islamic East and the West are reversed.
Since World War II, the United - States are the world's undisputed leader in science.
Throughout this period, the brightest students were drawn away from their homelands by the prospect of better career opportunities and research.
Until recently, more than half of the students university graduates in mathematics, science and engineering to the States - States were born abroad.
Many of these talents stayed after graduation, and both industry and the government have benefited.
Meanwhile, Islamic cultures entered a historical phase in which science was equated with Western influence and eschewed the same reason.
Even in countries where oil revenues could fuel a significant amount of research, Arab rulers did not encourage such investment, and the consequence is that their societies have not prospered as much as they could .
Recently, a desire for greater political respect has spurred Islamic nations to invest in technology, which is most visible in Pakistani and Iranian nuclear ambitions.
But while such weapons carry political weight, the science behind them is mundane and old.
The respect that comes from incubating insights, rather than the products of past discoveries, is much more significant.
Imagine the influence that would be a Pakistani institute that was the world leader in cancer research.
Change and political rhetoric - it if researchers in Oman discovered a key to suppressing AIDS?
This opportunity does not present itself for now.
But there is another, which is not limited to Islamic societies.
States - States have committed serious wrong - not recently.
"Matters of faith" have been substituted for science across government, from the presidency.
Top researchers have had their reports changed by members of the state - political operatives when the facts contradicted official.
Encouraged by an administration influenced by religion, school systems are shifting their focus from science to "values".
Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, entry visas are fewer and more difficult to obtain, which slows the flow of young talent into US universities.
Major scientific organizations have protested to no avail.
At the same time, tax laws have been revised to make the richest investors in the short term, discouraging long-term investment in research.
Half - trillion dollars has been spent on the war in Iraq, an amount roughly equal to the financing of all basic research for the last thousand years.
Although states - United avoid a fundamentalist dark age, it clearly risks losing its global dominance in terms of research.
Japan recognized the link between political clout and science in the 1980s.
The main Japanese industrialist, Akio Morita, CEO of Sony, and the right-wing politician Shintaro Ishihara, made a series of speeches that have been compiled and published in 1986 as The Japan That Can Say No (The Japan That Can Say No ).
They outlined a national strategy in which world influence arise from scientific power.
The main idea is that military power could be made obsolete if the "food chain" of military technologies was controlled by other nations.
The book's title refers to Japan's plan to "say no" to US military influence once Japan controlled key military technologies.
Building a knowledge-based economy through the oil wealth is quite possible.
For example, Texas, like most states in the southern states - the United States, was once economically poor and declining.
Even with oil revenues, the flow of dollars into the economy, by itself, does not boost prosperity as much as one might think.
So Texas decided to devote its oil money to an endowment for education.
Today, that endowment is roughly equal to that of Harvard University, and extends to 15 universities.
She has been staggering: aerospace manufacturing has almost disappeared from California, but is booming in Texas.
The research centers and telecommunications consortia have flocked to Texas, even from the Canadian telecommunications giant Nortel.
Although the industry is in crisis States - States, Texas has one of the strongest manufacturing economies in the world.
There is no reason that the same results can be achieved in the Middle - East.
But above all, the Islamic world must rediscover and embrace its proud heritage.
Iran Debate on Iraq.
No country in the Middle - East is following the events of the post - war Iraq as closely as Iran.
Geographical proximity, an intense and violent history of war with Saddam Hussein's Iraq, religious and emotional connections with the Shiites in Iraq, some concern about the states - the US and their policy in the region: these are the son that bind Iran to its western neighbor.
Given the endless tensions with America, Iran is particularly concerned about the possibility of a US continued presence in its neighbor, as well as the dominant role of America in building the future of Iraq post - Saddam.
Foreign observers may find it difficult to follow the Iranian internal debate, yet they exist, they are intense, even if they are not always visible to the international public.
Three general approaches in the Iranian debate can be identified changing over Iraq in the post - Saddam.
Iranian pragmatists argue that Iran must inevitably cooperate with States - States in Iraq in the post - Saddam, even if it is only to ensure that the rights of the Shiite population of Iraq are respected .
For this reason, Iran should win assurances that the new Iraqi leader would not it be hostile and seek to win bilateral friendships.
Other key considerations for the pragmatists concern the preservation of Iraq's territorial integrity and repatriation of tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees living in Iran.
They are moderates who think that the Iranian government should urge States - States for the extradition of members of the Mujahideen Khalq Organization (MKO) based in Iraq, and the total dismantling of the organization.
In exchange, the Iranian government should provide support to ensure peace, stability and security in Iraq.
In sum, the pragmatists would limit US - Iranian relations, focusing on a program that largely reflects the internal concerns of Iran.
In general, conservative forces in Iran support this approach.
Another approach offers a more active and cooperative role for Iran in the reconstruction of Iraq.
Advocates of this position argue that Iran is well positioned to facilitate reconstruction, due to its well-established infrastructure of personal and institutional links with Iraq.
Finally, it is believed, the states - the United States and the international community recognize the value of Iranian cooperation.
Iranian cooperation should be rewarded by the dismantling of the MKO infrastructure in Iraq, may - be in exchange for an Iranian promise to address the activities of Al Qaeda and expel Al Qaeda members of Iran.
Above all, Iran should invite the Americans to respond to its cooperation with the assurance of a guarantee in return that Iran does not become in the future targets of US military action.
In short, advocates of cooperation are calling for an open and explicit market: the support of Iran to ensure stability during the current transitional phase as well as its commitment to maintain cooperative relations with all permanent government that will emerge Iraq in exchange for improved regional and international position of Iran.
This view is widely shared within reformist movements in Iran, both within and outside the government, and by the technocratic and business class whose orientation is more international.
Finally, for Iranian radicals, the possibility of cooperation with States - United remains pure fantasy.
They are convinced that America seeks to undermine Iran's security and compromising its national interests.
According to the radicals, States - States will seek to impose the least significant changes in Iranian foreign policy.
At worst, say - they, America seek to impose a regime change in Iran actively.
It will campaign enthusiastically against the acquisition of nuclear knowledge and energy by Iran and might even try to weaken the military capacity of Iran as a whole.
The radicals perceive the US invasion of Iraq as a reflection of the American desire to encircle Iran.
In return, they believe Iran should adopt an aggressive stance in defending its interests, forming strategic alliances with Russia and other regional powers and use Iranian influence in Iraq to prevent the formation of a Government pro - American and anti - Iran in Baghdad.
The supporters of the hard line of all stripes support this approach.
The overthrow of Saddam and his regime was only the easiest part of the Iraq crisis.
Now the hard part: establishing peace and security, winning the war against terrorism and convince the Muslim masses that America has no intention to occupy Iraq to siphon all its oil resources and redraw the Middle - East in his image.
Meanwhile, the opposition against states - the United States, under the expression of suicide bombings and other forms of terrorism, will probably only grow.
Iran is to maintain its key position in the region through its political dynamism and Muslim identity whose echo resounds throughout the Muslim world.
What happens in Iraq has major implications in Iran and the United - States would do well to find a way to recognize this fact.
US threats, or discussions on another war, fuel the fire of resentment and frustration in Iran, strengthening the most radical movements.
If States - United wish to avoid such effects, they must agree to limit their influence of its own radicals, recognizing that US interests in Iraq are best served through a cooperation with Iran.
A way out of Iraq.
The situation in Iraq has reached the point where everyone ostensibly wants the same thing: the departure of coalition forces.
The recent disclosure of a confidential note from the British Ministry of Defence troop withdrawal underlines this aspiration.
The only question is how to satisfy it.
As long as the Coalition forces stay, violence will only increase.
However, if they leave, the escalating violence will take place anyway, and even faster.
The real question is how to achieve in Iraq to organize an army and police who can be trusted to enforce law and order.
Much remains to be done to approach this goal.
Despite the courage of many Iraqis who join the ranks of the police or the army, it comes as no surprise that some have less than pure motives.
In northern Iraq, old scores are adjusted and ethnic segregation is introduced is traditionally mixed in some areas, such as Irbil.
In other areas, sharia is imposed.
How can Iraq - it could create bodies to enforce the law effectively and impartially, regardless of ethnicity, religion or gender?
The traditional answer is to recruit, train, and instill the "right values."
But time is short.
You have to find other means.
In the absence of a deeply rooted value system, Iraq needs associations rooted in civil society, in which the police and the army will be held accountable.
They could take various forms, but the most important is that they are really extended to the local level, and that they have the support of the district authorities, the region and the country when they report abuse.
If a local monitoring is in place, completed and nationally recognized, while most members of the military and police forces probably will behave appropriately, and if not, it will be easier to identify them and the manage.
Such measures may appear overly optimistic, yet in Afghanistan, a country like Iraq in many ways, many groups are working well.
The Cooperation for Peace and Unity (CPAU) provides a model of how to operate.
In Afghanistan, as in Iraq, the priority of ordinary people was to reduce violence.
CPAU worked throughout the country over the last three years to establish peace committees at the district level, supported by satellite Peace Councils in villages.
The initiative faces a culture in which violence is so deeply embedded that children at a time, learned arithmetic by counting the dead Soviet soldiers.
The Committees therefore tried to gather all the groups in the community, including teachers, tribal leaders, religious leaders, women, police, judges and businessmen, to design ways to resolve conflicts without violence.
Although the Committee does not officially play a monitoring role so far (it is planned for the future), the mere fact that the police, army and justice are part brought into contact with the rest of the community, provides feedback and helps to establish trust.
Some results are remarkable.
In one workshop, the local military commander came to spend a few hours a courtesy, and ended up staying all week.
He went and apologized for his violent past and pledged to disarm his private army of 2,000 men.
He regularly visits today at the offices of the Committee.
In Iraq, projects such as the Humanitarian Liaison Center in Kirkuk are starting to fulfill a monitoring function by offering the public the various ethnic groups the opportunity to exhibit their grievances and get help to solve its problems.
But too often, even in the case of a trial, judgment is not applied because the victims succumb to the threat.
US and British forces have already worked to strengthen civil society.
Yet we do not hear about the workshops for women's empowerment, or the successful organization of small-scale local elections in the country.
Mobilize civil society is a huge challenge, especially when, as in Iraq, it must be done quickly and widely.
Military forces are still needed, but so is the encouragement to disarmament, which may take the form of prospects most successful economic opportunities that crime and theft ..
Fortunately, such an organization of civil society is also inexpensive it is important.
The Humanitarian Liaison Center treats any combination Kirkuk at an annual cost of $ 75,000.
With $ 10 million, we could set up a hundred similar centers, and remain of the currency.
It is now time to engage in this direction, without failing to support the brave people who took up the challenge to demand accountability in government.
Otherwise, the Iraqi people may not know the security it desperately needed after so many years of suffering.
Democracy on the Nile?
The surprise decision by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to propose a constitutional amendment authorizing the holding of direct and competitive presidential elections may well be a giant step for democracy in Egypt and the Arab world.
Westerners used to pluralistic democracy may find it hard to understand what potentially huge shift this will be in a country accustomed to military rule for over 50 years.
Under the current system, Egyptian citizens can only occur on the day of a presidential referendum every six years to say yes or no to the single name that appears on the presidential ballot.
This explains why someone like Mubarak always received over 90% of the vote, albeit amid indifferent turnout.
Syrian and Iraqi strongmen have done even better with this system, no doubt because they demanded that the names and addresses of voters be put at the bottom of each ballot.
Many individuals have long argued that democratization in the Middle - East can not progress until Egypt is not fully involve in the process.
Egypt could not really commit to a path of democratization without first amending its constitution, in order to reduce the Pharaonic powers of its president and limit the duration of its mandate.
Mubarak, after all, is already in its 24th year as president.
Thus, his announcement of competitive presidential elections is an important first step.
The regime may assume that it will be able to use the process to its advantage, but events may be more difficult to control than expected once people begin to feel empowered.
The democratic genie is out of the bottle.
In any case, Egypt is not the only country in this troubled region to embark on the path of democracy.
Turkey on one side of the Middle - East and Morocco on the other are already well into the process.
The real groundswell this time seems - will result from the close timing and positive outcomes of recent elections held in Iraq, Palestine, and to a lesser degree in Saudi Arabia.
The unprecedented demonstrations against the occupation of Lebanon by Syria following the assassination of its former prime minister, Rafiq al - Hariri, do not seem to diminish.
Egyptian opposition groups have also organized marches more courageous and other forms of civil disobedience in recent weeks.
The catalyst for their anger was the arrest and detention of the leader of the ailing opposition Ayman Nour, in late January.
The arbitrary attitude of the government has reinvigorated the national movement Kifaya (meaning "Enough"), which demanded an end to the Mubarak regime.
Suddenly the popular wisdom that Egyptians are passive and afraid to act did not seem Apply.
An alliance of local, regional and international forces is uniting against tyranny-as on the Nile.
The recent wave of popular pressure appears to have shaken the regime.
Only a month ago, Mubarak departed constitutional reform by taxing demands of "futile."
But, whatever combination of events that brought this change, the election initiative should be welcomed.
This is a necessary first step, but insufficient to overhaul the stagnant political system of Egypt.
Egyptians are already wary of token reforms in Tunisia, a country in which President Zine El Abidin Bin Ali, who holds office for a long time, created a caricature of a constitutional amendment that appeared to open the door for competitive presidential elections, but which has subsequently led to a sham contest with a few "opponents" handpicked.
In previous Tunisian presidential referenda, Bin Ali routinely 99% of the vote; he has now got 96%.
Hope that Mubarak is more serious about electoral reform.
To prove his sincerity, he must order the immediate release of Ayman Nour and take steps to end the 24-year state of emergency that prevents successful organization of political campaigns.
Mubarak should also endorse a limit of two consecutive terms of five years for each president.
Equally necessary measures to gain the trust of citizens, including open and equal access to the media, which are currently controlled by the state.
I announced that I intend to contest this upcoming presidential election in order to open the debate on these essential reforms.
But I would gladly go back to my private life as a citizen when I have the assurance of a free election and open next fall.
If seriously implemented, these steps will transform Mubarak's legacy.
With the events in Lebanon, Iraq and Palestine, they could very well usher in an Arab spring of freedom, long overdue.
Historic elections for Egypt?
Egyptians go to the polls on September 7th to elect a president from among 10 candidates, including Hosni Mubarak, in power for 24 years.
While few doubt that it will be re-elected after the election, many follow the steps with passion.
Some 6,000 domestic election observers have been trained for the occasion, and hundreds of international observers will arrive in the country this week.
Although all the trappings of a true electoral contest are in place, it is striking that several signs of authenticity missing.
Despite promises to the contrary, the playing conditions are far from fair.
Mubarak still commands disproportionate assets: name recognition, a quasi - monopoly of the electronic media controlled by the state and no less than 85% of the print media.
One week before the poll, some opposition candidates have not yet had the opportunity to broadcast a single campaign on Egyptian television.
All members of the presidential election commission are Mubarak appointees, and the new election rules eliminated any independent challengers.
Since 2000, a decision of the Supreme Court states that 8,000 Egyptian judges must supervise and certify election results.
This is a big step toward fairer elections, as the judges' professional union has remained fairly independent over the past half - century of control over the executive.
The Mubarak regime has had to use various ploys to neutralize the union of judges.
One of them was to stretch the definition of "court" to include thousands of graduates employed in law, the court inexperienced but loyal to the government. This leaves little in the true judges, for if they protest by boycotting their supervisory work, the task will fall once more to police from the infamous Ministry of the Interior.
Thus, in the past, the judges' union has fulfilled his task, with predictable results.
During the 2000 parliamentary elections, while Mubarak's ruling party received roughly 38% of the vote in districts supervised by true judges, that percent somehow jumped to 86% when almost - judges were responsible for the observation.
This year promises to be very different.
In the spring the judges held a nation-wide assembly and resolved that unless the regime granted them full independence, and exclusive oversight of the voting process they would not supervise the upcoming presidential (or parliamentary) coming .
On 2 September, they made their final demands: allow civil society groups to observe the elections, stop changing the definition of legitimate judges for electoral purposes, and agree that no ballot box will leave the presence of a legitimate judge until its contents are counted, certified and reported.
For now it seems that the situation is hopeless, as the head of the presidential election commission has stated publicly on Egyptian television that he refused any comments by the citizens of the election.
Other interesting developments on the eve of the election include a fierce public debate on the topic must - it boycott the election or to vote?
Many opposition parties have called on their members to abstain in protest against restrictive election rules that strongly favor Mubarak.
Moreover, the Muslim Brotherhood, considered to be the single strongest opposition group in Egypt weight, urging their followers to vote their conscience but not to support any "despotic and corrupt ruler."
This is a clear if implicit repudiation of Mubarak, the only head of state in 24 years.
Some 34 civil society organizations are preparing thousands of young Egyptians to monitor the elections despite repeated governmental objections.
These groups argue that if the regime does not intend to rig the elections, while the presence of national and international observers should not be a problem.
The regime's response is to say that any outside monitoring is an infringement on Egyptian sovereignty, and that domestic monitors are an affront to the integrity of judges.
The latter argument was quickly undermined when the judges' union in favor of observers from civil society.
Whether the Mubarak regime is running scared because of the interior and exterior that put the challenge to organize free and fair elections, or is simply unable to remove cheating in the party as it has become inherent in its operation, the present signs do not bode well for the ballot next Wednesday.
Meanwhile, for the first time the Egyptians are exciting experience of the challenge to tyranny, and enjoy a whole new area of ‚Äã‚Äãfreedom.
The desire of European dollar.
Currency can play a vital role not only in commercial transactions, but also in the diplomatic and political disputes.
When this happens, commercial transactions become more difficult and subject to greater uncertainty.
The politicization of money during the depression of the - between - wars proved economically devastating.
But nasty currency wars took place more recently.
During the 1960s, the international monetary order became the subject of a fierce political struggle.
Each side had quite different theories and explanations of the situation.
Europeans, particularly the French, complained about what General Charles de Gaulle termed the "exorbitant privilege" of the US dollar.
The General and his monetary guru, Jacques Rueff, argued that the United - States used the dollar's status as the major reserve currency of the fixed exchange rate regime of Bretton Woods to manage deficits and pay for their military adventurism in abroad (at that time in Vietnam).
France has responded with calls for monetary reform that would end the special role of the dollar and tried to revive the largely discredited gold standard.
Europeans began a long discussion on the benefits of monetary union, whose implementation would allow them to compete with the dollar.
But from the American point of view, the international role of the dollar was a trap.
Other countries could change their exchange rates and could maintain greater competition in exports.
The US government was powerless in the face of a yen under - rated, fueling the belief that the world was using the dollar to attack America's manufacturing base.
The Nixon administration concluded that the only way to save the American economy was to engage in monetary unilateralism (monetary expansion so dramatic that other countries would be forced to adjust their exchange rates).
These battles long forgotten suddenly seem very present again.
The world no longer has a fixed exchange rate regime, but the dollar remains the major reserve currency, a sort of floating Bretton Woods.
For Americans the reserve role of the dollar is a potential threat, while for non-Americans, he would rather be another example of neo quest - for US imperial hegemony.
During this decade, China has replaced Japan 1960, preventing its exchange rate to climb to push export growth.
This made her the target of US complaints about unfair competition and efforts to impose an adjustment of exchange rates could deter Americans from buying toys, appliances and Chinese clothing.
US manufacturers have estimated that the supports - throat made in China threatened the American way of life.
Between - time, Europeans (especially the French) complain about the big US deficits, and de Gaulle's argument claiming that the world is paying for America's wars is in fashion again.
Some Europeans suggest that Asian central banks should hold a greater share of their reserves in euros, an echo of the unsuccessful attempt to surrender General America by selling dollars against gold.
The 1960s ended with the collapse of the "system" and a major financial turbulence, accompanied by an inflationary surge in commodity prices.
Everyone has been affected and the role of America on the world stage has been shaken.
A similar collapse now should have a significantly different effect.
The current floating rate system is more stable and the costs of adjustment differently distributed.
The majority of Americans do not suffer greatly from the sharp decline of the dollar as foreign sellers have to make price adjustments for the US market.
Asian economies are growing vigorously and Their central banks rely on the United - States.
They should continue this policy to not see their export sectors undergo a sudden failure in the US capital.
The United - States will have more time to process a current account deficit that does not reveal viable in the long term.
The economically dynamic regions of the world (North America and Asia) are thus bound by a pact that will ensure continuity of the centrality of the US dollar.
Americans will continue to pile up debt because Asians to encourage it.
The repeal of the pact would be against the interest of both parties.
It is not an American unilateralism, because it means working with Asia.
But for Europeans, who are excluded from the pact, it looks like monetary and economic unilateralism.
Between - time, the supremacy of the euro to the dollar hurts European industrial exporters.
Europe is not, however, able to relieve them.
, Europe will be the major sufferer in the new currency clashes.
Answers prognosticated in the 1960s (restoration of the gold standard or invention of a common European currency) do not seem very useful.
A single currency has failed to provide substantial protection.
The old version of the European response (what psychologists call "dollar envy") will only become more pervasive.
The European Central Bank will be invited to expand the monetary base, as if imitating the dollar were the answer to all industrial, structural and demographic problems that invade Europe.
But we should remember that the problems of Europe are not from currency manipulation.
The protests against the new version of exorbitant monetary privilege of America should be considered for what it is: a way to offset a real European powerlessness.
The desire of the dollar is therefore ready to disappear and it will increase the international value of the dollar disappears without causing any obvious adverse effects on the people who print and use.
A policy of epidemic.
Americans, like citizens of all countries of the world have come to accept that politics plays an important role in the appointment of certain kinds of public officials.
Few of us are surprised (though some may be disappointed) when a federal judge or a senior diplomat appointed because he managed a crucial test of loyalty to an important principle in the eyes of the party of the president or prime minister.
But science, in the opinion of all, occupies a special place and on this point, the United - States are beginning to serve as a warning example to the rest of the world.
Scientific appointments should be based on training objectives, competence and performance.
Clearly, it is legitimate to interrogate a future Secretary of Health and Human Services (SSH) on his views on abortion.
But it is totally inappropriate to submit candidates to serve on scientific advisory committees for political loyalty tests.
Similarly, membership of organizations examining the scientific proposals, a fundamental process for scientific progress, should certainly be free from any barriers that are unrelated to professional qualifications.
Unfortunately, scientists in the United - States are facing more and more often these barriers.
During the fall, the journal Science published several reports on the issue.
One of these stories was about the massive replacement of members of the Advisory Committee of the National Center for Environmental Health, part of the Centre for Prevention and Disease Control (CDC), without consulting the center's director.
Similar cases have also been reported in the Advisory Committee on Lead Poisoning and Prevention CDC's Advisory Committee on National Human Research Protections, and the Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing.
The current epidemic of ideology, in which advisory committees are dissolved and then reformed with new members, and where the candidates are subjected to loyalty tests, seems outdated to some observers.
Representatives of SSH spoke of it as a "fairly common practice."
It is not a common practice in America, or at least not until now.
In any case, the fact that the Bush administration do pass tests to candidates in key positions to determine their compatibility with its "values" is not really disturbing.
The most alarming development is the degree of importance of the ideological investigations that interfere in areas previously - there immunized against this kind of manipulation.
Indeed, the most telling case in this growing political epidemic can - being concerned the redesign of membership in the study section of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health that evaluates grants for the study of injuries occurred in the workplace.
Advisory committees might have been vulnerable to occasional shuffle of this type in the past.
After all, they have recommended policies that politicians take into account or not.
But study sections?
In October 2002, Science published an editorial by David Michaels and several of his colleagues.
Many of them were former distinguished officials involved in some of the committees concerned and they brought a valuable perspective to the issue, based on their personal experience.
Their article was a case in him - even, but the consequences he had were even more interesting.
He unleashed a volley of letters in which scientists evoked similar experiences.
A candidate for the Muscular Dystrophy Research Coordinating Committee of the National Institute of Health told that an investigation had been conducted on it by a member of the White House.
After being invited to discuss his views on the various policies of the Bush Administration, including any of them had any connection with the work of the committee, she had to indicate whether it supported the policies of President on stem cells embryonic.
Other person to have manifested itself, a distinguished professor in psychiatry and psychology recounted receiving a call from the White House about his nomination to the National Council on Drug Abuse.
The caller told him he had to make an inquiry on him to "determine whether his views could embarrass the president."
According to the professor, a series of questions ensued, the representative of the White House into a scorecard.
Example: "You got two out of three; the president opposes needle exchange (for intravenous drug users) for moral reasons, whatever the outcome.".
Then the conversation took an even more alarming turn.
The representative asked the candidate if he had voted for Bush and, after receiving a negative answer, he asked: "Why have - not you support the president?".
This attitude is akin to a dictatorship, not a democracy.
The purpose of scientific advisory committees is to provide impartial advice and reflected the political process.
There is nothing to gain and much to lose, when a desired policy outcome is put forward.
This is why determining research projects to support has always been an issue to be examined objectively by peers and not by politicians.
In fact, the law that applies here (the law on federal advisory committees, the Federal Advisory Committee Act) specifically requires that committees are impartial and "not inappropriately influenced by the authority holding the power of appointment."
US Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson and the office staff of the White House should set an example to the world.
They can do this very easily: within the law.
Murder in Moscow.
It's time to end the fiction that the "dictatorship of law" Putin has made Russia post - communist any less respectful of the laws.
The murder of Anna Politkovskaya, one of the journalists of the best and bravest of Russia, a woman who dared to expose the brutal murders committed by Russian troops in Chechnya, is final proof that President Putin directs a mill dictatorship with the usual contempt for the law.
It is time for the world to recognize it, particularly for Europe.
The German Foreign Ministry is preparing a policy on relations between Russia and Germany that will enshrine indifference to the lack of respect for the law shown by Putin as national interest of the most powerful member of the European Union.
But indifference becomes appeasement when it encourages Putin to continue on this path in the international arena, as in his current campaign to strangle Georgia's economy.
Politkovskaya's murder was a grim sense of deja - vu: just as in the glory days of the KBG, in Putin's Russia people simply disappear.
Politkovskaya's is the third political killing in three weeks.
Enver Ziganshin, the chief engineer of BP Russia, was shot to death in Irkutsk on September 30.
Andrey Kozlov, Vice - Governor of the Central Bank of Russia leading a campaign against financial fraud, was assassinated on 14 September.
The fact that the Russian Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika, took over the investigation into Politkovskaya's murder in hand, as he did to that of Kozlov, does not inspire hope, as would be the case in a real democracy if such a high level involvement in an investigation.
In fact, the involvement of the highest levels of government in Russia is practically a guarantee that the killers will never be found.
Politkovskaya's murder is a particularly grim augury when you consider that she was a scathing criticism of the Russian president.
In her articles for one of the few remaining independent papers in Moscow, Novaya Gazeta, and in her books "Putin's Russia: Life in a Failing Democracy" and "A Dirty War: A Russian Reporter in Chechnya," Politkovskaya wrote of the suppression of freedoms sign of Putin's presidency.
As shown in the fate of former exiles businessmen Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinki and that of the imprisonment of oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the fate of Putin's enemies can take three forms: exile, imprisonment, or the grave.
I am not accusing Putin's government of ordering the murder of Politkovskaya.
After all, as an investigative journalist in the country, it has enraged many other people additionally Putin, including the current Chechen Prime Minister Ramzan Kadyrov not least, it has accused of pursuing a policy against kidnapping ransoms.
But even if Vladimir Putin's associates had nothing to do with the shooting of Politkovskaya in an elevator of her apartment building in central Moscow, his contempt for law created the climate in which the murder was committed.
Like the murder of Thomas Beckett in his Canterbury Cathedral there many centuries, the crime was committed in the clear belief that the king would be satisfied.
Given what Politkovskaya represented - the responsibility of a democratic press to question the Kremlin and its policies - the government should have ensured that it happened to her.
Putin's Russia has already lost 12 leading journalists to murder in the past six years.
None of these crimes has been solved, which would not be the case if the "dictatorship of law" Putin was anything more than a PR strategy.
The six years that have elapsed since the arrival of Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin have been a time of deeply conflicting signals.
On one hand, the world sees a young, educated leader pledging to modernize Russia, particularly to align the law enforcement and judicial practices with international standards.
On the other side, the president just looks without saying anything while his former colleagues of the Russian security service FSB (former KGB) absolutely not protect those who are murdered, and even launching a series notorious espionage cases against the journalists, scientists, and environmental activists.
These "neo - spies" include journalist Gregory Pasko, the arms control expert Igor Sutyagin, diplomat Valentin Moiseyev, physicist Valentin Danilov, and many others.
Supposedly civilizing influence what is involved in being a Western partner, chairing a G8 summit in St. Petersburg, for example, seems to have been lost in the Putin's Kremlin cabal.
Once again, the contact with the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the West gave birth to another Potemkin Village; Russia presents a fa√ßade of laws and democratic rules, but behind that cardboard decor - it's the same dough arbitrary butes who make the law.
Globally, the danger is that the non - compliance with laws shown by Putin exports.
Near the Russian border, a form of criminalized diplomacy is taking root.
Think about how Putin's attempt to rig the elections in Ukraine, and the accusations brought cesses and withdrawn against the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
Consider the breakaway regions playing francs - shooters in Moldova and Georgia that exist only because they have the support of the Kremlin.
Watch as the Kremlin seeks to blackmail its neighbors by threatening their energy supplies.
Every policeman knows that when you ignore criminal behavior, criminals ones - will only become more daring.
It is high time that the world recognize Vladimir Putin for what he is: a man who is taking Russia back into the shadows.
The world must now ponder that old Latin maxim qui tacet consentere videtur: who is silent consents, and wonder if it is really wise to quietly consent to Putin's construction of an energy superpower where the law does not count.
A pipeline to strengthen the Empire of Russia.
Gerhard Schr√∂der that there is less than a month, was still the German Chancellor has agreed to become chairman of the company responsible for the construction of a gas pipeline from Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea and Western Europe .
In many countries, Schroeder would now be charged with the crime of conflict of interest.
His apparent ethical lapse is magnified by the fact that at the same time, Russia threatens to halt gas supplies to Ukraine if - it does not yield to the price demands of Gazprom, the gas giant state property Kremlin.
The strategic goal of Russia is obvious. Currently not distribute gas to Ukraine also means that much of Europe will no longer be stocked as most major pipelines through Ukraine.
Bypassing Ukraine, Poland and, of course, the Baltic States, the new pipeline will increase the influence of the Kremlin seeks to reassert itself in the region.
President Vladimir Putin and his government of clones ex - KGB will not have to worry about the reactions of Western Europe when deciding how hard to pressure the neighboring post - communist Russia.
Europe should - she really equip Putin of such imperialist weapon?
Worse, Russia needs - she used this weapon to put the EU to its energy boot?
A former German chancellor is going to lead the company that could provide Russia with a means to manipulate the EU economy demonstrates the dangerous complacency of Europe face the neo ambitions - imperialist Putin.
Of course, the Russian media are aware of the growing dependence of Europe by reports of Russia's energy resources.
They even revel in it. Russian editorialists wrote "When we integrate and increase our energy trade with Europe, it will remain silent on the issue of human rights.".
Putin expresses this position more obliquely by pledging to pursue what he calls a "political independence.".
So, want - it just means that Russia must remain "independent" of the concerns of the Western democracies on ethics and human rights.
It may be that some European leaders really do believe that maintaining the EU's soft prosperity justifies be silent about human rights and other issues that annoy the Kremlin.
Of course, we need to briefly speak on the issues "commercial" as the expropriation of Yukos. But if the Kremlin were to monetize our values ‚Äã‚Äãor our critical mind to him - as about the bloodstained Chechnya - it seems that Europeans would rather be silent than face a potential increase in energy prices or even a blockade such as that which Ukraine currently faces.
Even as Putin reorganized his court, submitting the Duma to his will, the EU hopes to see Russia become more "European" should be abandoned.
Russia Putin is currently building was gradually transformed. She abandoned her post free hopes - to become a Soviet oil and gas bulwark in favor of the new elite of the ex - KGB.
Indeed, Matthias Warnig, the director of the pipeline consortium led by Schr√∂der, is a longtime friend of Putin.
Earlier in the year, the Wall Street Journal revealed that Warnig, the director of the Russian branch of the Dresdner Bank, is an ex - officer of the Stasi, the secret police of the former East Germany , and met Putin in the late 1980s when the Russian president was KGB spy in East Germany.
The Russians accept a government made up of former KGB men, for whom lack of compassion and the refusal of dissent are the norm, reflects their exhaustion to the tumult of the last twenty years.
Now the Kremlin believes that what is good for basic Russians also for the citizens of independent nations. No mercy will be granted to small countries low after Russia hold the means to intimidate, isolate them and threaten energy blockade.
As a former Head of State of the newly independent Lithuania, I have often been faced with such threats.
The EU has signed numerous agreements with Russia, including for a "common space" for freedom and justice.
The Kremlin is very good at feigning such idealism.
Its control over Eastern Europe has been imposed on the basis of "friendship treaties" and the Soviet invasions of Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 were missions "fraternal".
But look how Putin violates this "common" space: barbaric treatment of Chechens, the imprisonment of the businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky, harassment of foreign NGOs and the charge of Yuliya Tymoshenko, one of the muses the Orange Revolution, the Russian military judges on charges completely invented.
If Europeans genuinely believe in their common space for human rights and freedoms, they must recognize that those values ‚Äã‚Äãare not shared by Putin calculators henchmen.
It is the same with regard to regard Russia as an ally in the fight against terrorism.
Is - it really conceivable that the homeland of the "Red Terror", countless unpunished crimes from the Soviet era, and which bears traces of blood from Lithuania to the Caucasus can actually help to combat the global threat from Iran and North Korea?
It seems more likely that the Kremlin's cold minds will merely exploit each crisis to increase their destructive power and influence.
For decades, the European region where I come from was left to thank you from evil.
That's why I can not remain silent when Europe stumbles blindly into a new appeasement.
We, the new democracies of Eastern Europe, have learned from our history that behind every diplomatic act of Russia hides an imperialist ambition.
Western Europeans, who have forgotten this story should reflect our warnings.
Dependence on Russia - even if it takes the face of the so - called "charismatic" Gerhard Schr√∂der - can only lead us straight into the wall.
Iraq: bullets against ballots.
When the Iraq war started in 2003, the Bush administration stroked ambitious projects the image of Germany and Japan post - 1945, a long and peaceful occupation was envisaged, during which the increase oil production would ensure growing prosperity together with democratic structures were built piece by piece.
The foundation was to be a liberal constitution or post - modern with the added guarantee of 25% of parliamentary seats provided for women.
The current Iraq knows neither peace nor prosperity.
The constitution to be voted on October 15th includes that 25% rule, but nothing liberal.
The provision - key (Article 2) stipulates that no law may contradict "the undisputed rules of Islam" violates the basic principles of parliamentary sovereignty, and will prevent legislation consistent with international standards.
For example, the age of sexual consent for girls can be raised to - over nine years since Muhammad himself - even had a wife of nine years.
It follows that girls as young as nine are adults under criminal law and passable for the death penalty for example, conversion to another religion.
Shias can use this provision to place their ayatollahs - above the elected parliament, as in Iran, because they alone are authorized to determine the "laws" of Islam.
Foreigners and the few Iraqi liberals worry mainly about this Islamic provision, but the opposition to the constitution, widespread among Sunnis, is other provisions: the exclusion of the "Saddamist Baath Party" from political life and government, and the federalist provisions that grant autonomy to the 18 Iraqi provinces and allow them to join in regional governments.
The exclusion act is a personal issue for elite Sunnis, including thousands of businessmen, liberals, even artists who, with few exceptions, were all Ba'ath members.
In theory, the constitutional prohibition could not be retroactive.
But in practice, administrative laws are now being implemented to exclude members of the Baath so - called "high-ranking" of any form of government employment, which affects thousands of people.
The Sunnis would probably accept the federalist provisions if they applied only to the Kurds.
They know that the alternative is not a return to centralism, but secession by the three Kurdish-majority provinces of Dahuk, Erbil and As Sulaymaniyah to form an independent Kurdistan, with its own finance department, army (the Pesh Merga ) and oil production around Kirkuk, the second largest reserves in Iraq.
Sunnis reject the same federalism for the Shias because they view them as fellow Arabs who have always accepted Sunni law in the past and will do it again, unless they have their own government.
This is what the new constitution would allow, for the southern provinces - which have the main reserves of Iraqi oil - Shiite majority could form their own regional government.
In the usual style of the Middle - East, disappointed Sunni leaders, unhappy with the constitution, now threaten to use violence.
But federalism is not the only reason why the followers of the Sunni supremacists and Islamists launch deadly attacks.
Their opposition is more elemental: they do not accept the principle of democratic government by the majority.
Instead, they seek to restore the rule of the Sunni minority.
For the Islamists, all Shias deserve death anyway, as apostates.
Shiite leader Moqtada Sadr, has also vehemently opposed to federalism.
His supporters, largely illiterate, are the poorest and most violent Shias of the slums of Baghdad and - beyond whose "Mahdi militia" fought American troops in 2004, even while the Americans were protecting Shias attacks Sunnis.
As a young priest derived his authority from his father, a deceased Ayatollah populist him - even Sadr faces opposition from Iraqi living Ayatollahs, who despise his ignorance and violence.
Sadr can not possibly compete with them in terms of religious authority, so he chooses to take an Arab party - nationalist against them, often recalling that the highest Shia cleric, Ayatollah Sistani, is not Arab but Persian .
Similarly, he reminds his followers that El Hakim, who headed the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), and their militia "Badr" were subsidized exiles in Iran, many of whom fought on the Iranian side during the long and bitter Iran - Iraq war, until the Americans "bring them back."
Sadr opposes federalism because a Shia regional government would obey his enemies, Sistani and the SCIRI, and, he says, fall under Iranian leadership.
To underline his message, Sadr sent his men to fight the Badr militia successfully in Baghdad, where mahdis are many, but not in Najaf, where Sadr is hated after the destruction he caused last year to that his men were massacred by the Americans.
It was hard enough to face the bandit Sadr. Now a simple political calculation suggests that it will probably be the main character to decide the outcome of the vote on the constitution in October.
To reject the constitution and cause new elections for a constitutional assembly, opponents need a two-thirds majority in at least three provinces.
The Sunnis are only likely to win in two provinces, but if Sadr orders his followers in Baghdad's slums to vote no with local Sunnis, it will probably drop the capital in the hands of opponents of the constitution and ensure its defeat.
Like any political thug, Sadr is naturally for sale.
Last year he was wanted for murder.
Today it seeks recognition as a statesman, he wants money, and, at least implicitly, humiliation Sistani and SCIRI.
It may very well receive proposals, and negotiations can - even begun.
But some of the Shias he attacks with words and bullets have thousands of armed men to them and for them, it deserves that return balls.
The end of the secret.
Transparency is not always an easy exercise in the new democracies of Eastern Europe. This was discovered Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany, when a recording in which he admitted the lies of the government sparked riots.
Such as Hungary, Romania post - communist endeavored to encourage openness and honesty in a society that once numbered among the most closed in the world.
But the persistence of a culture of secrecy blew corruption and abuse of power.
We note however a real evolution towards more transparency, evolution recognized by the European Union has given the green light to Romania for membership in early 2007.
In addition to the introduction of what the EU stands today for a "functioning market economy" essential reforms in the political and legal, which I am responsible, range from increased transparency and control the financing of political parties to the reorganization of the judiciary.
Judicial reforms contribute to root out corruption.
Ministers and former ministers, parliamentarians, judges, lawyers, and members of the police, customs and other public bodies, as well as private entrepreneurs have been indicted.
In addition, new forms have been developed for wealth declarations and financial interests by those in official positions in government, parliament, public and local administration and the judiciary.
The new reporting procedures are the most detailed in Europe, and above all they are made public.
Progress of Romania are confirmed by a report published this month - one, that citizens of Eastern Europe now have access to government information as well as those of the established democracies of long standing.
The Transparency and Silence report of the Open Society Justice Initiative (available on www.justiceinitiative.org) even shows that new democracies are sometimes better than the old: some Romanian government bodies more responsive to requests for information from citizens their French or Spanish counterparts.
Specifically, 60% of requests are in Romania, against 31% in France and 24% in Spain.
Other good performers include Peru and Mexico, two countries that have adopted legislation on freedom of information in 2002, shortly after Romania.
Yet it is not always easy to access sensitive information in transitional democracies.
I worked as a lawyer for the defense of human rights in the Romanian Helsinki Committee, and we often had to go to court to demand the release of information under Romanian law 2001 Freedom information.
For example, when we officially gained access to data on wiretaps authorized by the Attorney General, he simply ignored the decision.
We attacked civilian, and the judge imposed a fine for each day of delay in reporting.
Only when the media became interested in the case, that the data - number of eavesdropping during the previous ten years, those affected and duration of operations - were released.
Romania then finally started to turn his back on a past marked by the omnipresence of the Securitate.
I am now part of the government, and I realize that it is not always easy to share some information with the public.
But sometimes painful reforms are necessary.
We would not have carried out economic and political reforms that will allow us to enter the EU without subjecting our policies to public scrutiny and without accepting increased citizen participation in decision-making that inevitably accompanies such opening.
In fact, access to information has become a sine qua non of democracy around the world.
When the United - States have adopted the Freedom of Information Act in 1966, they were the only ones, with Sweden and Finland.
Today, 65 countries have such legislation.
In Romania, those who fought for the adoption of a law on freedom of information taking full advantage.
According to the study of the Justice Initiative, the people who come to the Romanian government receive little difficulty the information it would have been unthinkable to communicate it a few years ago.
Thus, the Romanian Ministry of Defence has disclosed the number of soldiers who died in 2003, and the circumstances (including 13 suicides, two deaths by gunfire, and two combat deaths in Afghanistan).
Another example, the Bucharest Tribunal received a request for the number of judges is the subject of a disciplinary procedure from the beginning of 2000, and reasons for possible sanctions.
The court forwarded the request to the Superior Judicial Council, which gave a complete answer: four pages listing all sanctioned judges, motives and actions.
This process is both the result and the motor of continuing reform.
The rulers have not always been very comfortable with the opening, and the battle continues for the most sensitive documents.
But in the former communist countries, the benefits of transparency are undeniable.
Yet the experience of Romania shows that official secrecy remains a threat, no country is safe, and that only a vigilance of every moment can prevent it from undermining the foundations of democracy .
Save the trees of life.
No one can finish the day without using a derivative of the forest.
In a larger extent than is generally believed, the paper on which is written, the water flowing from our taps, drugs that treat us, the wood that our homes and our furniture is made all come from the forest .
Forests give us fresh air we breathe and are home to endangered species.
They also provide us with recreational areas, which is becoming increasingly important in our complex world.
About 1.5 billion people living in poor rural areas depend directly on forests for their basic needs for food and firewood.
Yet deforestation continues.
Every year, we lose 14.6 million hectares of forest, an area almost as large as four times Switzerland.
Irresponsible forest management, enhanced by regulations and weak government bonds, and markets that reward illegal logging all conspire to deprive the world of its most valuable and threatened forests.
When the forests start to disappear, a host of environmental, social and economic problems usually follow, affecting us all in one way or another.
The island of Sumatra in Indonesia is a good example.
The pulp and paper companies are undertaking a rampant and illegal destruction of forests that contain the greatest diversity of plants in the world.
It is likely that as yet unknown plants disappear in the process just as endangered species such as rhinos and Sumatran elephant and the orang - utan.
When the forest of Sumatra have disappeared, entire communities are also left without appropriate places to live and no decent way to make a living.
In addition, the distortion that trade in illegal products and cheap products to world markets is necessary because of difficulties for responsible citizens.
Developing countries are losing $ 15 billion in tax revenues annually due to illegal logging.
To complicate matters, the demand for wood for reconstruction following the tsunami last year, has intensified an already unsustainable demand vis - a - vis the Sumatran forests.
The basins of the Amazon and the Congo are subject to similar threats.
A recent United Nations study, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA), shows that forests and other important regions are in serious decline due to mismanagement and will continue to disappear unless serious protection measures are not in place.
Information published by the Brazilian government show that deforestation of irreplaceable forests in the Amazon, from agricultural conversion, reached 2.6 million hectares last year, bringing the total deforested area of Amazon to 17%.
Yet the battle against deforestation is not yet lost.
Different organizations, movements and defense companies concerned about the state of the world's forests are working together to reverse the phenomenon of deforestation and improve forest management.
Thus, for example, WWF (World Wildlife Fund) and the World Bank helped the Brazilian government to launch an initiative to establish new forest protection areas on more than 17 million hectares in the form of national parks.
The cooperation of WWF and the World Bank has also motivated other partners to establish a trust fund to manage these protected areas in perpetuity.
Similarly, a summit meeting of the leaders of the countries of the Congo Basin has enabled cross-border cooperation for forest conservation and responsible management.
All this led eventually to release $ 53 million from the State Department of States - States to promote conservation of Congo's forests.
Since the first meeting of leaders in 1999, 3.5 million hectares of protected areas were newly organized in the Congo Basin.
However, given the consequences of the Asian tsunami last December, the weight of evidence provided by the EM and statistics on deforestation of the most critical areas, we must continue our efforts.
The World Bank and WWF recently pledged to work towards the reduction of 10% of the global deforestation rate for 2010 and work with the institutions of the public and private sectors to enable ambitious achievements in forest conservation.
WWF studies show that if the world's forests are shared between different uses, including the protection of certain areas, responsible business management and forest landscape restoration, we can meet the world's needs for forest products while maintaining environmental values ‚Äã‚Äãand Social critical to our near future.
Business leaders, governments, civil society organizations must all play their part in achieving this vision.
The Saudis are - they fanatic?
Terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia have led many to question the prospects for survival of the ruling House of Saud and the question whether the kingdom is fundamentally dysfunctional and destructive or not.
For one reason or another, it seems that Saudi society has produced a stream of violent fanaticism that draws its inspiration from extreme religious orthodoxy.
The fact that 15 of the 19 hijackers who took part in the attacks of 11 September 2001 against the United - States were Saudis crystallized a long-held view of the kingdom as a bastion of authoritarianism and intolerance .
In some respects, this perception is correct, but it can not be applied to the Saudi population as a whole.
On the contrary, it would be a grave mistake to assume that fanatical Islamism fully defines Saudi attitudes toward religion.
Between 2001 and 2003, I was part of a team to achieve a large-scale study of values ‚Äã‚Äãin Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran and Jordan.
Our results provide a surprisingly nuanced picture of Saudi attitudes.
Compared with respondents living in other countries in the Middle - East, the Saudis have proved the least religious of all in general, and their attitudes toward democracy and arranged marriage also indicate a sense sub - underlying moderate.
It is certain that in the four countries, religiosity is widespread, more than 90% of respondents collectively reporting that they believe in God, in life after death, and heaven and hell.
But the Saudis appear to be less religious than their fellow Muslims.
Seventy - two percent of Saudis described themselves as religious individuals, against 82% of Iranians, 85% of Jordanians and 98% of Egyptians.
Americans also appear to be more religious than Saudis, with 81%.
This variation can be partly explained by cross-national differences on the meaning of "religiosity".
For example, Americans may define religiosity differently than people in the Middle - East with can - be less pronounced attachment to religious beliefs in Islamic countries.
This might also account in part for the differences between Muslim countries.
But the gap between the Saudis on one side and Iranians, Jordanians and Egyptians another in self-defined religiosity is so great that it challenges the prevalent perception of Saudi Arabia as a highly conservative and religious .
Indeed, actions speak louder than words: only 28% of Saudis said they attended religious services weekly, against 27% of Iranians, 44% of Jordanians, 42% of Egyptians and 45% of Americans.
These findings, while running contrary to popular perceptions of Saudi culture, are less startling than they appear.
Sociologists of religion have long argued that in a monolithic religious environment, or when religious institutions are closely linked to the state, the overall religiosity of the public declines.
It makes sense to think that when state authorities enforce strict codes of behavior, people tend to rebel and move away from officially sanctioned religious institutions.
It is thus hardly surprising that Egyptians and Jordanians, who live in countries where the state does not enforce piety, are more religious than Iranians or Saudis, who must deal with the police " Under "locale supported by the state.
Even on the issue of marriage, many Saudis expressed surprisingly liberal views.
The respondents were split almost evenly on the question of arranged marriages, with half supporting the idea that marriage should be based on parental consent, against 48% who considered love as the basis of marriage.
Since gender segregation and paternal dominance firmly anchored, this result seems to reveal a strong desire to greater individual choice in what has been traditionally a family decision.
Finally, the Saudis turn out strong supporters of democracy, contradicting again the widespread image of Saudi conservatism.
All Saudis polled, 58% considered democracy the best form of government that is, 23% disagreed and 18% were not expressed.
The massive support for democracy in a country without secular and nationalist history seems against - intuitive.
In fact, support for democracy corresponds to several other liberal attitudes that we found in Saudi Arabia.
Supporters of democracy tend to be less religious, more secular, more tolerant of others, more critical of public sector shares and more worried by the Western cultural invasion.
To - beyond the study data, history has shown that liberal ideas become more popular when a despotic monarch governs with the support of a religious institution.
A strong current of liberalism appeared in the late nineteenth century in Ottoman Syria in response to the religious despotism of Sultan Abdulhamid.
At the same time, a secular movement anti - clerical behalf of constitutionalism appeared in Iran in reaction to the absolutist alliance between the shahs Quajar and religious institution.
In light of the similarities between those historical precedents and current conditions in Saudi Arabia, we should not rule out reform.
The study data also suggest that Saudis may well require a more transparent policy and a less interventionist religion.
The European museum.
At the end of the nineteenth century, Asia accounted for Europeans a source of artistic inspiration or the target of imperialist ambitions.
Conversely, Europe was a symbol of modernity - for the Japanese Meiji - or decline - for the Chinese.
A century later, thanks to the Japanese economic miracle, Europeans saw at least a small part of Asia as a center of rapid technological and industrial progress.
Today, at the turn of the century, mutual perceptions of Europe and Asia are changing dramatically, as Asia's economies boom and a European Union identity crisis.
Prominent Asians, such as former Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, are now warning Europeans that if they continue on this momentum, the continent will soon be of interest to tourism and real estate top range.
Chinese influential businessman who divides his time between Hong Kong and London was even more accurate.
He said it a few weeks ago, during a private gathering in Paris of political leaders and big business leaders: "You are to become the Third - World You're wasting your time. with the Constitution, the welfare state, the crisis of funding pensions, and you always make the wrong answers to the questions you ask. "
The idea that Europeans have of Asia in general and China in particular, is more complex. It goes from the lucid adjustment to a new respectable competitor to outright ideological rejection.
In May 1968 some French students took to the streets to invent a new world were dreaming of Maoist China, a country yet immersed in a brutal and senseless Cultural Revolution.
This absurd infatuation was the result of both the ignorance of Mao's crimes as boredom felt in a prosperous society full employment.
Today, their heirs are openly criticizing the Asian capitalist model.
China, once anti star - capitalist revolutionary utopian, has become the enemy ultra - liberal nemesis for a new generation of utopian reactionaries who defend the status quo in Europe.
Students who have recently demonstrated in the streets of Paris did not want to imitate Chinese and Indians; they reject the logic of globalization and the abandonment of hard-won social.
The attitude of the European economic elites is very different.
They understood that their conceptions post - colonial tinted nostalgia, that China and India would be vast exports and huge cheap labor reservoirs markets are obsolete.
These countries have become genuine competitors worthy of respect or admiration.
Quality, cost and delivery times - in the automotive industry, for example - are reaching the European level.
Europe retains an advantage in science, as in the pharmaceutical industry, but new high-performance businesses, especially in India, reaching more and more to recruit graduates of MIT and Harvard, and - through always lower wage costs - remain competitive globally.
Unfortunately, if European leaders have recognized the Asian challenge, they have failed to translate into a lesson in realism, in a compelling context of globalization, or a call to arms in social and economic field.
Indeed, the European politicians, with few exceptions such as Tony Blair, have been slow to adapt to blazing developments in Asia.
Devoid of long-term strategy, and obsessed with short-term interests, European politicians - in contrast to business leaders - have not earned the respect of their Asian counterparts.
Still, on a continent that has not managed to bury the past and end the specter of nationalism, the EU is also a model of reconciliation, peace and prosperity.
But this image can - it survive a further decline?
For Asians, the European model could become a political version of Venice: a place that we visit with the nostalgia of past grandeur, like a wonderful museum.
Red and blue.
The appointment of Condoleezza Rice as Secretary of US State, replacing Colin Powell shows that the recent presidential elections still have powerful implications.
It is important that Americans but especially the world understand what the election reveal of America.
The presidential election this year proves that American democracy is healthy, and that some things could usefully be improved.
Unlike the 2000 election, where President Bush had not received the support of the popular vote and barely won the vote of the Electoral College, Bush won 3.5 million votes this time - it .
While some Democrats remain bitter, the legitimacy of Bush's victory can not be questioned.
America is sharply divided between red states, Republicans and blue states, Democrats.
If 100,000 votes had swung into the red state of Ohio, John Kerry would become president (though a minority popular vote).
The Electoral College was incorporated into the US Constitution to protect small states in the federal system and that means now that the election campaign is now focusing heavily on a dozen States at all, battlefields where opinion public is closely divided.
Basically, there is something unbelievable in electing presidents without a popular majority.
It is time to discuss the constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College.
Some observers complain of rhetoric and good negative ads divisive that characterized the campaign.
This should be seen in a historical perspective.
At the time of the Founding Fathers, newspapers were taking advantage easily and George Wahsington appeared dismayed by the harshness of political language.
For much of its early history, not to mention the Civil War and Reconstruction period, the country was as closely divided as it is today, and bitter campaign rhetoric has always reflected this close competition.
However, despite the negative ads from both sides, the three nationally televised debates raised important issues in a serious format and were widely followed.
In general, any current president benefiting from economic growth is likely to be reelected.
In this sense, the real surprise of the re-election of Bush was the small margin of majority.
In large part, this is due to the unpopularity of the Iraq war.
Kerry tried to turn the war, the low rate of job creation, inadequate medical coverage and Bush tax credits toward the privileged classes of the central issues in the campaign, but some observers felt it failed to send a clear message.
Mr. Bush countered with the issue of security against terrorism and cultural populism on issues such as gay marriage and abortion.
Finally, the cultural populism and security have prevailed against economic populism.
The interpretation of the election was influenced by exit polls of polls in which voters were asked to decide (after voting) on ‚Äã‚Äãissues that have meant the most to them.
The majority (22%) answered "moral values" in comparison only 20% cited the economy and 19% terrorism.
Social conservatives interpreted this to mean that they had won the election, and Bush that their program was to dominate his second term.
But a Pew poll taken a week after the election indicated that the category of "moral values" embraced a wide variety of issues in addition to abortion rights and gay marriage.
In fact, polls show that 25% of the public defends gay marriage and 35% favor legal civil unions for gay couples (position defended by Kerry).
However, for the 37% who oppose gay marriage especially in red states in the center of the country, the issue helped rally supporters of Bush to bring them to the polls.
The question is, overall, if the United - States are divided in - beyond all hope.
The electoral map of red and blue states has given rise to Internet jokes and cartoons about the two blue coasts secession of the red center of the country.
Some call it "C√¥topie."
But the divisions are not so clear.
In both camps, many states were won by a small margin and if one colors the map by county rather than state, most of the country turns purple.
City against suburbs and rural areas would be a better description of the situation instead of C√¥tes against heart of the country.
Indeed, public opinion polls show that most Americans are concentrated in the moderate center of the political spectrum rather than extremes.
But political elites, such as party activists and members of Congress tend to be more extreme than the public.
At first, this seems surprising, since they would be attracted by the center, rich voice.
However, many members of Congress represent districts that are acquired to their party and the real threat to their re-election comes in party primaries dominated by the more activist and extreme wings of the parties.
This trend is reinforced by the rise of cable television, which attracts viewers through controversial information programs - entertainment and Internet writers called chronic Blogs, who engage in fierce polemics with no editorial filter.
A reform that would change the boundaries of congressional districts to make them more competitive permettrer address this problem, but few are chosen will vote for such changes that could increase the risk of defeat.
The lower margin of the results suggests that Mr. Bush does not really change the mandate he thinks he won.
Faced with difficult questions in foreign, fiscal and dociale policy, it would be wise to turn toward the center rather than conciliate his conservative base, but the policy will prevail between the conviction of policy or pragmatic policy remains uncertain.
Oil are winning!
Chancellor Angela Merkel has made the fight against climate change the top priority of the German Presidency of the European Union and the G8 that begin in January.
Its concrete proposal is general enough that leaders recognize and accept, and clear enough for other governments and businesses to understand: at the upcoming G8 summit, it will simply set a date from which vehicles running on gasoline will not be registered in the major industrialized countries.
This will have a significant positive impact on geopolitical and economic levels.
Today, the real energy-related concern is not related to the reduction of world oil reserves, but the decline in domestic production of the largest consumers - Europe, the United - States and China - even as growing demand in Asia strike the market.
Available reserves will focus more in the Middle - East, because the other regions of the world will soon dry ..
Moreover, the major oil exporters are unwilling to submit their investment policies to market conditions.
Saudi Arabia wants to manage only its production of oil and, for its part, Iran scares potential investors with bureaucratic hurdles and corruption.
Iraq suffers from a lack of security, while foreigners are thwarted every attempt Investment in Russia.
Those four states contain half of the world's oil reserves, two-thirds could potentially be exported.
These factors, apart from the cost of production, are the cause of high oil prices and the race for contracts in Africa and Central Asia.
The belief that the oil price rise is good for the environment ignores basic facts of international politics.
First, in most poor countries in Africa and Asia, imported oil accounts for a larger share of national expenditure than in industrialized countries, which means that economic growth and social development are compromise, and new debt crises loom.
The rents from oil production impede reforms in the major exporting countries.
By strengthening their financial power, regimes like those in Venezuela and Iran feel less constrained by international rules.
The latest arrivals among the major consumers of energy, such as China, mimic the former habits of the industrialized West and its long tradition of blind eye to human rights violations, in order to secure contracts lucrative with authoritarian regimes and rich in oil.
Only political and economic heavyweights, the industrialized countries that remain by far the biggest oil consumers can initiate change on a global scale.
It is important to start with the transport sector, which is currently more than half of oil consumption - a proportion that will most certainly increase in the future.
Therefore, the G8 countries should agree to no longer register of rolling new cars with gasoline from 2025.
This decision is not directed against individual mobility, but against the waste of a scarce resource to be used primarily to produce synthetic materials.
Politicians should not favor any particular technology.
Instead, they should encourage the auto industry to develop alternative technologies that use biofuels, ethylene, hydrogen, and even natural gas, for a transitional period.
Countries that have opened the way for the political will in the matter, as a collateral benefit, put domestic industries in first place in the energy technology for future markets.
The significant expected reduction in CO2 emissions could eventually lead to the necessary progress in international climate policies.
Economic development also comes in: if we treat our "addiction" to oil, the poor and less developed countries and newly industrialized countries, could be more, which would reduce prices and calm energy competition.
At the geopolitical level, profits would be equally evident, including major oil exporting countries would be less able to blackmail industrialized countries.
This change would increase the bargaining power of the international community in the Middle - East and consolidate the social forces in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia that seriously wish to promote political and economic reform from within.
Large automobile producer and countries with advanced technology, Germany is well placed to launch such an initiative.
Angela Merkel, who holds a doctorate in physics and started her political career in the environment minister position - presiding in 1995 the first conference of the Convention - United Nations Framework on Climate Change - would more credible than any other of his colleagues in the European Union and the G8 to tackle the problem.
It is time to perform an act of political courage.
Myth humanitarian aid and trade.
Humanitarian aid and trade have become words to international fashion.
More aid (with a debt relief) and greater access to rich country markets for the products of poor countries: it now seems to have taken first place in the international agenda.
In fact, today's debate is no longer about what to do, but the amount of action and how quickly.
Lost in all this are the clear lessons of the last five decades of economic development.
Foremost among these lessons, we find that economic development is left largely in the hands of poor nations them - selves.
Countries that have done well in the recent past have done so through their own efforts.
Humanitarian aid and the markets have played only a minor role.
Take the example of a developing country that has free and preferential access to the market of its largest neighbor, which also happens to be the most powerful economy in the world.
Suppose further that this country is able to send millions of its citizens to work across the border, receives a huge volume of foreign investment, and is totally integrated into international production chains.
In addition, the country's banking system is supported by its rich neighbor's willingness to act as lender of last resort.
Globalization could be in better circumstances than those - there is - right?
Consider a second country.
The one - it faces a trade embargo on the world's largest market, receives neither foreign aid nor any form of support from the Western world, is excluded from international organizations such as the WTO and can not borrow from the IMF and the World Bank.
If these external disadvantages are not debilitating enough, you can add an economy that interview her - even barriers against international trade (in the form of state trading, customs import barriers and quantitative restrictions) .
As has guessed the reader, these are real countries: it is Mexico and Vietnam.
Mexico shares a long border of 3.200 kilometers with the states - the United States, which provides not only privileged access to a market of goods and labor, but also to share in the resources of the US Treasury (as became the peso crisis in 1995 has demonstrated).
By cons, America maintained a trade embargo against Vietnam until 1994, has not restored diplomatic relations only in 1995 and has granted most favored nation status to Vietnamese imports for years later .
Vietnam has not yet entered the WTO.
Now consider their economic performance.
Since NAFTA was signed in December 1992, the Mexican economy has experienced an average annual increase of just over 1% per head.
Not only is well below the rates champions of the Asian economy, but it is also only a fraction of own growth performance in Mexico decades preceding the debt crisis of 1982 (3.6% per year between 1960 and 1981).
Vietnam, however, has seen an annual increase of 5.6% per capita between the onset of its economic reforms in 1988 and the restoration of diplomatic relations with the United - States in 1995, and has experienced continuous rapid growth rate 4.5% since.
Vietnam witnessed a dramatic fall in poverty while Mexico has seen a fall in real wages.
Both countries have experienced sharp increases in international trade and foreign investment, but the overall picture is very different where it counts most: in the improvement of living standards, particularly among populations poor.
What these examples show is that domestic efforts trump all other elements in determining the economic fortunes of a country.
All that the US market had to offer in Mexico could not offset the consequences of policy mistakes in the domestic market, especially the failure to reverse the real appreciation of the exchange rate of the peso or extend the productivity gains obtained in a narrow export business sector to the rest of the economy.
What matters most is whether a country adopts the right growth strategy.
Without the Mexico's advantages, Vietnam pursued a strategy that the diversification of its economy and improving the capacity of local suppliers.
The overall experience of the post - war supports the conclusion that domestic policies are what matter most.
South Korea took off in the early 1960s, not when foreign aid was at its apex, but when they began to dry up.
Taiwan did not receive foreign aid or preferential access to certain markets.
China and India, the economic superstars of the moment, have prospered largely through their own economic reform efforts.
It is tempting to ascribe the foreign demand for their exports rare African success, Botswana and Mauritius (respectively diamonds and garments), but this can not go very far.
Obviously, both countries would be much poorer without access to foreign markets.
But, as in all cases of successful development, what distinguishes them is not the external advantages they possess, but their ability to exploit these advantages.
Just see how other countries have wasted the advantage of their natural wealth.
The word "diamond" does not arise specifically in mind an image of peace and prosperity in Sierra Leone.
Similarly, few of the export processing zones proliferating around the world have experienced the level of development observed in Mauritius.
However, this does not relieve the rich of their obligation to help.
They can make life difficult for corrupt dictators, by greater sharing of financial information and by not recognizing the international contracts they sign.
Similarly, the increase in the number of poor-country workers allowed to work in rich countries and a wide range of growth-oriented policies by relaxing the rules and conditions imposed by the WTO States - United produce a greater impact on the long-term development.
There is no evidence that expanding market access and aid are the most productive use of valuable political capital of the northern hemisphere.
Development should focus on improving the policy environment in poor countries, rather than aid and trade.
Interdependencies.
If the great Argentine economist Raul Prebisch were alive today, he no doubt would wonder whether the world began to turn upside down.
His widely influential theory of addiction argued that if poor countries relied too much on commodity exports, they would never achieve the industrial level needed to sustain rapid growth.
They embourberaient instead in a cycle of declining global commodity prices and reduction endless revenue share.
Prebisch's favorite response, protectionism, proved disastrous for the many Latin American and African countries that followed.
But the fact is that for years, Prebisch seemed to have made the right about trends in commodity prices over the long term.
Permanent efficiency gains in agriculture and resource extraction pushed down prices of raw materials, especially in the years 1980 and 1990.
With few exceptions, countries that focused on commodity exports have achieved only poor results, while Asian countries that have few resources have made rapid progress.
Today, however, with Asian giants, India and China, joining the global economy, the price of gasoline, gold, wheat, and virtually every other commodity are exploding.
Certainly there will always be cycles (the price of oil, for example, will probably fall again before resuming its rise), but the long-term trend for many commodities will clearly remain upward for some time.
What many trade negotiators and other policymakers do not seem to recognize yet, though Prebisch would have immediately understood is that this sudden turn of events carries huge implications for the global balance of power.
Indeed, no other aspect of economic globalization will pose greater challenges to world leaders over the coming decades.
The questions are many.
The rich countries today are - they prepared to enter a period of co - dependency, in which they are just as desperate for commodities as developing countries are for industrial products and technologies?
Are - they prepared for the inevitable flow of power and influence to the countries producing raw materials as those - they become much wealthier?
How the two super - World powers, China and the United States - the United States, will - they deal with the fact that major exporting regions of raw materials from Africa and the Middle - East to Central Asia are littered States - malformed nations?
Some self-proclaimed prophets expose the problem such as the boundaries of nature reserves and claim that the most critical raw materials decline at an alarming rate.
Nowadays, there are many adherents of the theory "Hubbert's peak" of oil production, which holds that we have reached the upper limits of our production capacity, the wells dry up and that the situation can not that degrade.
However, as indicated by the eminent historian Dan Yergin oil, the doomsayers have claimed that black gold resources were about to dry up at least four times already.
Each time, radical technological advances have made flying threats.
In the late 1800s, oil extraction involved dredging with mules.
Today drill at 3000 m below the ocean floor seems natural to everyone.
Such progress has also been made in the areas of metal mining and agriculture.
No, the world is not facing an impending shortage of raw materials.
In reality, it happens that the integration of 2.5 billion people (China and India) in the world economy produced a shift in demand likely to put even more pressure on rising prices raw materials any technology gains will probably capable of counterbalancing.
Therefore, and for at least 50 to 75 years, and can - even until humans start mining on Mars in the coming centuries, prices for many natural resources will rise.
The new balance of economic power that results it will destabilize world politics?
The First World War was partly triggered by concern of Germany before grabbing by the other colonial powers too much of the world's oil and raw materials.
Similarly, during World War II, Japan feared for the stability of its supplies petroleum and other natural resources from abroad.
Such tensions are - they appear between China to the uncertain resources (even water scarcity is a problem) and the West?
Fortunately, this does not seem likely at the moment, especially given the approach as sober and pragmatic of their country resource problems shown by the Chinese leadership.
The Chinese are looking to regions like Africa, hoping to find stable trading partners.
They do not share the political evangelism of the Americans, who do not just want to trade with commodity exporters, but also want to convert.
And then there are those American leaders who still speak of making the states - US self-sufficient in terms of energy resources.
This is a joke: sufficient, can - being but self - sufficient, never.
Much of the Arab world thinks, understandably, that the invasion of Iraq as the cornerstone of US strategy aimed at securing stable energy resources.
If they are right, one can only hope that America has a backup solution.
Meanwhile, commodity prices will continue to rise and oil exporters constitute the largest contributors to the yawning trade deficit States - States.
Can - be it the real US strategy is to try to have the oil-exporting countries so much money that they - will become dependent on the happiness they bring to America!
This is a turning point that Prebisch would never have anticipated.
The radical choice of Iran.
The choice of Iranians to bring to power radical mayor of Tehran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, may worsen relations with the West and accentuate the isolation of the country internationally.
Yet in terms of national policy, the Islamist regime is likely to be better if a more moderate candidate had prevailed.
Clearly, Ahmadinejad has a real base of support.
The fact that he presented himself as a populist, he talked about helping the poor, condemned the government and acted almost like an opposition candidate are all irrelevant: he played the choice of the regime, and eventually received official help even against radical rivals.
The regime has shown great skill.
He transformed the candidate a little more pragmatic Hashemi Rafsanjani, disagree with some government policies, character in harmony with the established order, and its own candidate rebel.
The government has used the resentment against the establishment to consolidate his own power.
Since the former president, Mohammad Khatami, the reformist movement supported, although it was somewhat reckless and has accomplished nothing in the end it only emphasizes how leaders have returned to their advantage the political situation.
Ahmadinejad is a representative of the younger activists in the anti revolution - Shah of there 25 years.
He is directly involved in the taking of American hostages in Iran, though do not really know how.
Most disturbing is that it is close to the two main groups that represent the most extreme elements in Iran: Guard Corps of the Islamic revolution and the Basij organization.
The first is a parallel pro army - plan; the second is an organization for intimidating opponents and anyone seeking a more open society.
However, this concern that Iran in the hands of even more radical leaders is mitigated by two factors.
First, Ahmadinejad is likely to focus on domestic issues, and try - without being able to predict the chances of success - to improve the living conditions of the poorest Iranians.
Second, the group in power since the revolution will continue to run ideological and foreign policy.
The president has fewer powers than it seems, and it is especially overshadowed by the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Nevertheless, the election of Ahmadinejad creamery clarifies the challenge that Iran poses for Western policy and stability in the Middle - East.
First, it sends the signal to the most extreme elements of Iran and terrorist customers in that country - the Lebanese Hezbollah, Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and several small groups operating against Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other Arab countries - they have the green light to launch their attacks.
They will probably estimate that Iran will support them whatever they do.
Outwardly, Iran has often been relatively cautious, while playing the role of cover global terror sponsor.
Iranian officials have been individually act to order and coordinate specific operations, now feel freer to do so.
Moreover, Ahmadinejad openly advocates an intensive program to obtain nuclear weapons.
Most Iranian politicians, at least those that the government authorized to act openly, supports this program, but favors a more cautious approach and Discreet.
Rafsanjani, for example, passed the establishment of better relations with the West before the progress on the nuclear front.
If Ahmadinejad is president of a nuclear Iran, he is more likely to use weapons of a hazardous manner.
This does not mean that he would use, but rather that he would use for the purposes of diplomatic blackmail, raising threats to crisis levels.
Since Iranian leaders daily proclaim their desire to wipe Israel off the map and fight the States - US (Ahmadinejad stepped on a picture of an American flag by voting), the risk of confrontation has increased.
Finally, Ahmadinejad is likely to embolden the point of endangering the stability of Iraq, and his victory will encourage radical Iranian officials and Iraqi extremists.
Iran is already sending many agents into Iraq and supporting clients seeking to turn that country into a clone.
Iraqis, including Shia Muslims who follow the same version of Islam as Iranians, generally reject such interference.
A more militant Iranian position likely to increase friction with Iraq, and inspire more violent anti - American.
In short, the outcome of the Iranian elections is dangerous, even if its destabilizing potential will depend on Ahmadinejad's actions and the degree of power that will grant Khamenei.
In addition, having to deal with an Iran as openly extremist - radical even by the standards of an already harsh regime - will be a challenge not only for the States - the United States, but also for Europe.
European countries are going - they continue to pretend that the militant rhetoric and provocations of Ahmadinejad do not matter and that it is possible to find diplomatic solutions to the nuclear ambitions of Iran?
With Rafsanjani, a real agreement or at least an appearance of cooperation would have been easy to maintain.
But with Ahmadinejad will require a huge dose of conciliation would be to maintain - that the most minimal diplomatic process.
Some reformists and Iranian exiles welcome the election of Ahmadinejad, believing that his administration is more likely to show the true face of the regime and disabuse any Western hopes of compromise.
But it can also symbolize the success of the plan to return to his advantage discontent caused by a quarter century of radical Islamist rule.
Whatever the consequences, Ahmadinejad's victory mean for the West that everything related to Iran will become even more difficult.
Take the poor, give to the rich.
President Bush seems about to ruin the US budget for the coming years.
When President Bush took office, the forecast anticipated budget surpluses as long as one could imagine.
Today, thanks to a mixture of irresponsible tax cuts initiated by the Republicans, an economic downturn, the bubble burst of the stock market and a massive increase in military spending, the fiscal horizon is dominated by major deficits.
The worst is yet to come, because the Bush administration and Republican majority in Congress are preparing to worsen the fiscal mess.
The havoc they probably will weaken States - States and increase the instability of the international economy.
Usually, the US Republican Party defended balanced budgets.
This changed with the Reagan Administration, when conservative Republicans showed themselves in favor of tax cuts, even though this was done through large fiscal deficits.
President Reagan told the American people that he could enjoy at once tax cuts, strengthening the army and the continuation of their favorite spending programs.
The result, not surprisingly, was a series of large budget deficits and the elimination of which took several years.
President George Bush as President Bill Clinton had to raise taxes to bring order into the chaos of the Reagan era.
These tax increases probably contributed to the defeat of President Bush by Bill Clinton in 1992.
Yet Clinton bravely decided to complete the process initiated to restore fiscal balance, in part to protect the long-term financing of social security pension programs.
When Clinton left the presidency in 2000, the budget situation was the best in decades.
Then came President George Bush son, ready to replay Reagan with significant tax cuts, a significant increase in military spending and the continuation and even the development of popular spending programs.
The result was predictable.
In January 2001, the cumulative budget estimates for the years 2002 to 2011 had forecast a budget surplus of $ 5.6 trillion.
Mid - 2002, the anticipated surplus had vanished.
In light of these new economic conditions and in the shadow of the war against Iraq, one might expect that the Bush administration and the Republican Congress be cautious in defense of new tax cuts.
But far from it, their main priority is to implement more tax cuts that benefit only the wealthy classes largely.
At the same time, the government requires significant increases in military spending.
With the approach of the presidential election of November 2004, we can be certain that no significant reduction in spending will intervene in non-military programs.
It thus appears that the massive budget deficits are intended to continue.
If domestic spending simply remain constant, at a fraction of national income, the cumulative budget forecasts the next decade anticipate an overall deficit of $ 1.5 trillion.
But this figure could be very optimistic, because it is unlikely to take into account the cost of a probable war against Iraq or another set of tax cuts, nor the risk of rising interest rates for years to come.
Why Republicans show - they so little affected by this disorder?
Some Republicans care more about tax cuts for the affluent than anything else.
Others believe that deficits will lead by force deep cuts in domestic government spending, reducing the involvement of the state, which is their greatest wish.
The problem with that analysis is that most taxpayers are attached to social programs and does not easily support large spending cuts.
The most intriguing question remains as to why Americans vote for such policies when they should know that it will probably result in problems.
One answer is that many voters do not see coming fiscal problems.
A better answer is that most Americans did not actually vote for these policies.
The 2002 election turnout was only 40% of voters, and only about half of these 40% voted for the Republicans, or about 20% of those eligible to vote.
Of course, the outlook need not be so bleak.
The war against Iraq may be - be avoided.
Tax cuts could be approached moderate or abandoned.
But I predict large budget deficits for years to come and a growing sense of unease within the States - the United States and abroad about the macroeconomic situation in America.
Foreign investors may decide to reduce their financing of the government budget and the current account deficit of America in favorable terms.
The dollar could weaken, and the fear of inflation could become even more pronounced.
All this will lose confidence policymakers States - States that will be less flexible in their responses to economic shocks.
The disadvantaged, the United - States and abroad, could suffer the most, since President Bush and Congress say to the American people and the world that there are no funds available to address the issue of poverty, health and education, because of the large fiscal deficits.
If the average American does not open their eyes to these tax risks, the upper classes could receive another gift of billions of dollars while the country and the world bear the harsh consequences for years to come.
Lessons learned from the tax carelessness of America.
George W. Bush has done more to destroy the economic policy of the United - States than all other presidents in American history, exceeding even his mentor, Ronald Reagan.
In just three years in office, he has destroyed a fragile political consensus that had asked ten years of efforts, which may require another decade to be rebuilt.
In doing so, Bush has risked economic and social stability in the long term health of America.
Since the budgetary challenges in the long term as managing the United - States of an extremely awkward manner is not the only existing challenges, tax blunders of America provide important lessons for other countries.
The main problem with fiscal policy is that politicians can easily make it temporarily popular by cutting taxes and increasing public spending while accumulating massive public debts, leaving repayment to the future elected.
This trick can last a few years, but budget deficits and growing public debt needed sooner than expected a painful change of policy.
A cynical politician can buy his re-election, however, and can - be be retired when the crisis arrives.
One could imagine that after decades of similar episodes of political irresponsibility in countries around the world, voters would be allergic to this type of scheme.
However, Bush applied again today buying popularity by distributing massive tax cuts while simultaneously increasing military spending and spending on education and health.
The budget deficit thus obtained is equivalent to more than 5% of GNP.
Worse, the long-term budget outlook of America were already worrying before Bush began to apply his reckless policies.
The US population is aging, so the costs of pension systems and health care financed by public funds will increase dramatically.
Extensive calculations show that the revenue that will be generated through tax policies favored by Bush are likely not to reach the tens of trillions of dollars that represent the cost of public pensions, health care and other tax expenditures expected by population.
At some point in the future, it will significantly increase tax collections, drastically reduce government spending, or both, to address the actions of Bush.
So why the population supports - it political?
Because it includes some of these consequences in the long run, or that it cares little, even if those consequences will ultimately have an impact on the majority of Americans.
The richest taxpayers are of course happy because they received the bulk of the tax cuts.
Surprising as it may seem, the richest 5% of US taxpayers received about half of the tax cuts and these rich taxpayers clearly expect the other 95% (the middle class and the poor) support the majority future spending cuts and tax increases.
Between - time, Bush has convinced many poor voters and middle-class voters that they should be satisfied with their lot, without telling them they have to pay for their small tax cuts through reductions well more substantial future government services if his administration's policies prevail in the long term.
If Americans had a political memory, they would understand that they have already climbed the "roller coaster" tax over the last 20 years.
Ronald Reagan also took office promising massive tax cuts and large increases in military spending.
It ended with a huge budget deficit in the mid 1980s.
Tax cuts made Reagan enormously popular and helped him re-elected in 1984.
He then took a decade (from Reagan's second term to the terms of George Bush, Sr. and Bill Clinton) to return to a budget surplus.
Of course, this result required the approval of new tax increases, which cost her re-election to George Bush, Sr. and led to the polarized politics of the 1990s.
The story is very likely to be repeated.
Some right-wing ideologues in the Bush administration believe that the current budget deficits will lead ultimately a drastic reduction in government social spending.
They hope to dismantle programs such as Social Security and Medicare.
But the American public strongly supports these social programs.
So the strategy is to first cut taxes in order to drive must subsequently cuts in social programs is doomed to failure and inevitably lead to an increase in tax rates.
Other ideologues of the Bush administration argue that tax cuts are critical to exit the United - States of the recession.
This argument is also flawed.
The economy of America could have recovered without the tax cuts, and can - be even more securely.
In any case, it's a huge mistake to base long-term tax policies on short-term economic cycle.
Other countries have two key lessons learned from this.
The first is that the looming budget deficits of the United - States limit sooner or later the international power of America.
Americans supported the Iraq war only because they did not have to subsidize higher taxes.
When Americans are forced to choose between foreign adventures and higher taxes, they will be less likely to support expensive military operations abroad.
Indeed, the United - States will be deeply divided internally when the population will face the fiscal mess left by Bush.
The second lesson is that countries need to plan their budgets based on growing fiscal costs of an aging population.
The long-term budgetary conditions are rarely taken into account by taxpayers or parliament.
Governments should be required to submit budget estimates in the long term at the same time their annual budget proposals to reduce the trend towards political manipulation in the short term the budget.
The United - States can act as an alarm for other countries.
The White House should give other countries the same advice that magicians on television give their viewers: "Do not try this at home."
The politicization of the securities markets.
Many economic and financial analysts complain that the securities markets of emerging countries are often heavily manipulated by their governments and are more political than economic.
In contrast, a primitive force of economic regulates securities markets in developed countries and predict their performance is tantamount to predict tree growth.
This description of the securities markets in emerging countries is not wrong, just biased, because the same description applies to stock markets in advanced countries.
Indeed, the best analysts know that predict the stock market performance of any country really means to predict the degree to which the government wants investors in securities markets are involved in the current political environment .
Take the securities market of states - the United States, by far the largest in the world.
The government left alone companies and investment returns in the US securities market reflect the fundamental forces of a strong capitalist economy.
This partly explains why the United - United attract portfolio investors worldwide.
But the returns that make US stock markets so attractive reflect a delicate political balance.
In particular, tax rates that affect the securities have varied over time with the changing political pressure.
During World War II, for example, political support for great fortunes diminished and the government sharply increased taxes on capital gains, dividends, and high incomes in general.
When World War II has significantly redress the economy weakened by the Great Depression of the 1930s, President Roosevelt and Congress have introduced a tax on windfall profits to ensure that shareholders do not generate a profit too Therefore.
By contrast, in 1980, when there was no war but the stock market was low, US voters elected Ronald Reagan, a man judged by many as too right to be president.
He asked, and got, tax cuts on capital gains, dividends and income.
Political interference in the stock market does not relate only to taxes on capital gains, dividends and income.
Property taxes, indirect taxes, import duties and sales taxes, which are paid, directly or indirectly, by business, can have a magnified impact on corporate profits and thus the stock market securities.
It is no coincidence that wherever develop the securities markets, governments shall ensure that such taxes lower maximum corporate profits after tax.
Indeed, the policies of the securities markets does not stop with taxes.
On the contrary, almost every activity of government affects corporate earnings and, subsequently, the securities market.
After the crash of the stock markets of 1929, the US government suspended much anti-trust activity that allowed companies to gain a monopoly that would increase their value.
This policy delayed the decline in high unemployment, but was not enough to control the political forces deployed to support the securities market.
Similarly, one of the most important actions taken by President Reagan was to destroy much of the remaining power of American unions, which vied for their share of the industrial cake.
Reagan's victory during the strike of air traffic controllers in 1981 was a major turning point for the US labor movement, and also for the securities market, which launched its dramatic bull market in 1982.
The US government has been particularly hard to support the stock market since the peak of the illusion of stock prices in 2000, particularly to reduce the interest rates on several occasions.
Of course, this was publicly justified in terms of stimulating the economy, not in terms of support for the securities market.
But it is revealing the extent of the US securities market as one of the most important factors that weigh on the economy will be to equity down prices.
Indeed, the authorities' response was not limited to monetary stimulus.
National Accounts of products and income States - United show that the effective rate of tax on corporate profits (the percentage of profits actually paid to the government in taxes) is mounted in peak to 33.7% in the first quarter of 2000 (the record of the securities market and the economy in general) and dropped to 20.2% in the fourth quarter of 2003, when the market was down.
Much of this decline reflects the tax relief measures passed by Congress and the perception among businesses in the current economic and political environment they can be more combative to avoid paying taxes.
In addition, after the crash of the stock market, the maximum tax on dividends paid on securities increased from 35% to 15%, giving a substantial new advantage to investors over the long term and increasing the combined effect reinvestment of dividends after tax.
Again, this tax cut was justified to stimulate the economy which can of course be applied to almost any measure aimed at supporting the stock market.
But it is the balance of political forces that determines the credibility of this type of justification.
One could argue that the same variables, including hostility to high taxes and a weak labor movement, have operated in the United - States over the past 200 years and should continue to operate in the future, producing high returns on the securities markets and attracting substantial inflows of foreign capital.
Those who believe that investments in the US stock market will follow the same high growth trend for decades may well be right.
But it is important to be clear about what we predicted.
The forecasts are primarily not only the economy but also politics and even the cultural values ‚Äã‚Äãthat shape economic policies and performance.
The real estate market globally.
There are no more local investment property investment. The residence we buy is rooted in a specific place, like a tree, and blossoms or withers depending on local economic conditions.
Worldwide scrolls on our television screens, but the real estate market, consisting almost entirely of local amateurs, rarely crosses local geographical boundaries.
Soon, however, this could change.
Within a month, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), in collaboration with my MacroMarkets society, as well as Fiserv and Standard & Poor's, will launch options on futures contracts on home prices in ten cities of the States - States.
Contracts will be based on real estate prices of the S & P / Case - Shiller, established based on speculative research that my colleague Karl Case and I - have done the same, there almost twenty years.
We have long canvass for a real estate market futures, but no exchange, until now, would use these indices to create such a market.
The futures markets on home prices will allow investors around the world to invest indirectly in the US real estate through these markets.
A buyer in Paris, Rio de Janeiro, or Tokyo will be able to invest in owner-occupied housing in New York, Los Angeles and Las Vegas, among others.
A fundamental principle of financial theory - diversification or risk allocation - implies that interest in the new contracts will be.
Companies and people of New York, for example, are overexposed to local real estate risks. But by selling their housing futures, they should be able to reduce these risks.
Investors in Tokyo will assume some of the risk by buying futures accommodations in New York, if the price is right.
The New - Yorkers continue to live in their homes while having spread investment risk worldwide.
Experience a genuine futures market on uni residences - Family has not been retried since 1991 when the London Futures and Options Exchange (now called Euronext.liffe) missed the launch of such a market.
This test has never generated large volumes of transactions.
The Exchange has launched a concept that did not convince anyone.
British markets diversified paris on house prices, as well as some retail online markets, have never brought much either.
Will - it different this time - it?
Of course, the launch of a new market is still uncertain. People interested in an idea if it already attracted many others; if no one is deceived, it does not attract more.
It is the same for the markets. If there are no interested investors, it will not happen enough transactions to generate profits allowing to attract others.
However, as is the case with all great ideas, we never know exactly why they appeal. Also, we can predict the start of this new market, but we know that sometimes the success is there - you.
Initial indicators suggest that the growing interest in futures trading for home prices, especially because of the discourse on the "housing bubble" underscores the importance of risk diversification.
After the announcement of CME, one of its competitors, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, said his project to create options on futures contracts on major US regions, based on real average prices reported by the National Association of Realtors (National Association of Realtors).
However, besides the strong public interest in real estate investment and risk cover, another thorny issue must be adjusted so that the futures markets work well: prices must be revealed openly and investors must understand its meaning.
I think there is a good chance that these futures markets will soon lead to a fall in prices in some US cities.
Topics will "offset", as they say traders. Today, the futures market price is lower than the price of a property.
Presumably, the offset will not appear on the first day of real estate transactions, but it should happen in a few months.
We may need to offset some of these markets if actually fulfill their duties.
Everyone knows that these cities have experienced a huge housing boom in recent years (it is also a widespread global phenomenon).
International investors do not seem very likely to invest in these cities, without the prospect of lower prices based on futures markets. Tokyo The people have learned the hard way.
Now, if the offset is large enough, even investors who think that the US housing market is in decline will still wait a return of real estate prices in the future, because they already have a lower price on the market term.
Nevertheless, the New - Yorkers will need to make some adjustments to cover their own real estate investments, if they want to sell futures contracts naturally resulting in lower prices.
They will have to get used to the idea that the market has already anticipated this decline and they can not protect only the tiny margin potential that exceeds this advance.
In fact, such adjustments in our thinking will likely occur if one carefully observes the future market price.
So far, the evolution of property prices was mainly the result of diverse opinions.
When markets create an international consensus on housing prices in all major cities of the world, it will be easier to manage the risks they face by stabilizing the one hand, their economies, and secondly, our own living standards.
But what - what moves the markets?
Since about May 10, most global markets were strong cumulative declines, especially in the two weeks around May 23, with an average of over persistent downward.
Concerns of global stock markets - they mean trouble for the world economy?
Consider the largest decreases.
Among the major countries, the most impressive crash is that of India, where prices fell 16.9% between May 10 and May 22
The debacle on the other side of the globe took almost as extensive. There, the ups and downs have had a few days of step with those of India: in Argentina, stock prices fell 16.1%, 14.7% in Brazil and Mexico 13.8 %.
European markets also suffered large losses.
In Sweden, prices have tumbled 15.2% between May 9 and May 22; almost the same period, they fell 9.7% in Germany, 9.4% in France and the United - Kingdom and 9.3% in Italy.
In Asia, prices fell 11.5% in Korea, 9.3% in Hong Kong and 8% in Japan roughly the same period.
Many commentators try to tie such events to the situation in the States - States.
However, US courts have charged a 5.2% drop between 9 and 24 May
China does not seem to be behind the global decline since prices have risen there - low during this period.
The standard explanations economists concern monetary policies.
In the wake of the great deflation scare of 2003, central banks around the world cut interest rates, setting off speculative booms in housing markets and the stock market.
But today, if one believes this view, interest rate increases are beginning to bite, which portends further declines in asset prices.
There is undoubtedly an important element of truth in this argument.
The US Federal Reserve has indeed increased its interest rates on 10 and its president, Ben Bernanke, then indicated that further increases could occur in the future.
On 17 May, a worsening US data has been reported, suggesting that further monetary tightening.
Economists like to think that the world as logical and manageable, which implies that they understand what is going on.
But in doing so, they often exaggerate the role of central banks.
Indeed, the US rate increase was just enroll in a series of rate hikes - the 16th in a row.
No other major central bank raised rates after the beginning of the decline of stock markets in May until June 7 to 8, when several did (the European Central Bank, India, Korea South, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey).
Another factor is the price of oil, which rose 24% between March 22 and May 2, beating all records.
That would certainly be a major event capable of influencing markets worldwide.
Oil price increases have been a culprit in virtually every economic recession since World War II.
Yet the soaring oil prices do not match when stock prices fell most sharply in mid - May.
Argued that these increases caused the stock market declines presupposes a time lag of several weeks.
But stock markets are not very logical, and a lagged response to the oil price shocks could be possible.
As with any course in any financial market, an increase attracts attention.
When oil prices rise quickly, people watch the news that speak and talk to each of these increases, creating self - increased sensitivity to this news.
The crisis in the Middle - East is tied to oil prices, and it dominated the news of May.
Ominous signs and strong language used by various political figures were possibly amplified in investors' minds by the oil price increases.
On May 8, the Vice - Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, reacting to hostile statements by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has dealt that "the president of Iran should remember that Iran can also be wiped off the map".
Similarly, around the beginning of the fall of the stock market in May, Ahmadinejad visited Indonesia, the country with the largest number of Muslims in the world, and newspapers reported on May 13 that he had received a real ovation from students at two of the best universities.
This story may have been interpreted as evidence that the strategy of brinkmanship Ahmadinejad in the nuclear field brought him political dividends, fueling the perception that the tense situation in the Middle - East could lead to further price increases oil.
These news stories may seem far more remote stock market monetary policy.
But public reaction to them, as well as recent increases in oil prices, could come to a good extent the change in market psychology.
Attitudes toward risks change over time, and events like the remarks of Ahmedinejad and Peres can precipitate such changes.
So while these events are difficult to quantify, can - analysts should be - they pay as much attention to the words of Ahmadinejad to those of Bernanke in trying to understand the direction the global stock markets.
Economists like may - be not focus on the mindset of the public and how it interacts with price changes, world news and speculative dynamics.
This would imply that economic events are less predictable (and economists less omniscient) than they like to imagine.
Yet an intuitive point of view it makes sense to do so.
What he really has in the minds of investors?
Ahmadinejad is a charismatic, not Bernanke.
Ahmadinejad is embarking on an adventure, not Bernanke.
And can - be the most important, Ahmadinejad is a destabilizing influence, not Bernanke.
Whatever their ultimate cause, global stock market declines of the mid - May indicate an unstable market psychology.
Hard to believe that they were related only to opinions about likely monetary policy, and not to larger and deeper issues, in particular concerning energy and political tension, which are the basis of the performance of the global economy.
Why pay more for fair trade?
Marks & Spencer, the supermarket chain and apparel with 400 stores across Great - Britain has announced that it is converting its entire range of coffee and tea, totaling 38 lines to the label "Fair Trade" marketing symbol of "ethical production."
The chain already sells only coffee and tea bearing this label in the 200 coffee shops "Caf√© Revive."
It also encourages the purchase of shirts and other goods made from Fairtrade cotton.
This announcement came during "Fairtrade Fortnight". During the two-week promotion of labeled products, presentation sessions were held with producers in developing countries in order to explain to the British how this form of trade has helped their communities.
The movement toward more ethical consumption has made significant gains in States - States. Consumers are turning increasingly to organic, locally produced foods, such as eggs from hens free.
In the United - Kingdom, one study found that over 50% of respondents recognized the symbol of fair trade and understood that products bearing this label more respected the Third producers working conditions - World.
There is currently no comparable study in the States - the United States, but related data, and discussions I've had with my own students, suggests that the figure would be lower for Americans.
The Traders seeking Fairtrade certification must pay producers a price that covers the costs of sustainable production and a living wage.
For example, the minimum price for a pound of coffee is $ 1.26, regardless of the drop in the level of market prices.
If the market price exceeds this number, the tariff for fair trade will increase in order to remain higher than 5 cents / lb.
In terms of small producers, they must organize into cooperatives or other groups that allow democratic participation.
Plantations and factories can use the Fairtrade label if they offer a living wage to their workers if they comply with health standards, environmental and safety if they allow unions or other forms of workers' associations, if they provide good housing for workers who work away from home and if they do not use forced labor or child labor.
But everyone does not agree fair trade.
Brink Lindsey, director of the study center on the trade policies of the Cato Institute, a pro body - market, believes that the campaign for Fairtrade labeled coffee is a "dead end paved with good intentions."
It is explained by justifying that the real cause of the fall in coffee prices lies not in profiteering by multinationals, but big increases in coffee production in Brazil and Vietnam, combined with new techniques possible to grow coffee with less labor and hence more cheaply.
In Lindsey's view, if we want to assist coffee growers, we should encourage them to give up coffee to turn to more profitable crops - here he insists, correctly, on trade restrictions imposed by rich countries and subsidies that are barriers to be removed - or to products of high added value, such as specialty coffees that can be paid more.
What is strange about Lindsey's argument, however, is that the campaign for fair trade coffee seems to do exactly what he recommends, ie encouraging coffee farmers to produce a specialty coffee that can be paid more expensive.
Economists pro - market do not object to corporations that blatantly use the lure of luxury to promote their products.
If people are willing to spend $ 48 for a pound of coffee Jamaican Blue Mountain, because it is the favorite coffee of James Bond, economists do not believe in this case that the market is distorted.
So why be critical when consumers choose to pay $ 12 for a pound of coffee that they know has been grown without toxic chemicals, under shade trees that help birds to survive, by farmers who can now feed and educate decently their children?
Economists might reply that if we want to help people feed and educate their children, it is possible to buy a pound of coffee not - just tastes the same for $ 10 and pay $ 2 to an aid association distributes food and education to poor children.
This is actually a possible strategy. However, fair trade has real advantages.
The producers know they must provide a product appreciated not only for its taste consumers but also for the way it is grown.
If their product sells well, they are proud to have made a valuable product in the world.
From the perspective of the farmers receive a premium by selling a Fairtrade labeled product is preferable to receiving a charitable handout that they would get whether they worked or not and regardless of the quality of their production.
Paying more for a Fairtrade label is no more "anti - market" than paying more for a Gucci product.
In addition, the label reflects better ethical priorities.
It does not only consist of a grant from governments, its success depends on market demand, not political lobbying.
Fortunately, in Europe, this demand is growing rapidly.
Hope it will soon reach similar levels throughout the developed world, where consumers can decide how they wish to spend their money.
Calves, pigs and American democracy.
Among the flood of titles on the back of the Democratic majority in Congress after the November elections, the result of an important election went largely unnoticed.
Although he highlighted the shortcomings of the American political system, it also made me believe again in the compassion of ordinary Americans.
In Arizona, citizens can, if they have gathered enough signatures to submit a bill by direct popular vote.
This year, one of the questions submitted to popular vote was a law to prohibit the sows or calves reared for meat are strapped or confined in a way that prevents them from rotating freely, fold or expand their members.
Those who do not know the intensive farming methods may wonder - being of the need for such legislation.
Traditional breeding, as practiced all over the world there are fifty, and in some countries even today, allows animals to move and stretch.
But today, nearly 90 percent of breeding sows - the mothers of the pigs reared and slaughtered for meat, bacon and ham - spend most of their lives in stalls that measure about 60 inches by 2 2 meters.
They can not turn or extend their legs when lying down or forward or backward more than one step.
They are also sometimes strapped to limit their movements.
Similarly, the calves are confined to their lives in individual boxes where they can not turn around, lie down or stretch.
Essentially, these methods are designed to save labor costs. They facilitate management of the animals and allow to employ fewer workers and less qualified.
They also prevent the animals from wasting energy by d√©pla√ßdant or fighting them.
There are a few years, following protests by animal rights organizations, the EU Commission has requested a report to the Standing Veterinary Committee on EU intensive farming methods.
The findings indicate that the animals suffer from being unable to move and boredom of having nothing to do for days.
Of course, common sense allows to reach the same conclusions.
Following the report, the EU has set the dates from which the confinement of farm animals will be prohibited.
For calves, on 1 January 2007.
Individual stalls for sows, already outlawed in the United - Kingdom and Sweden, will be banned from 2013 throughout the European Union.
Measures to improve the well - being of laying hens kept in battery in mesh cages without enough room to stretch their wings, are also applied gradually.
In the United - States, nothing of the sort is planned.
Previously, when my European friends asked me why the United - States accused such delay in the well - being of livestock compared to Europe, I did not know what to say.
If they insisted I had to admit that one possible explanation was that Americans cared less about animals than Europeans.
Then, in 2002, the animal rights groups managed to submit to popular vote a proposal to ban individual stalls for sows in Florida.
To everyone's surprise, the proposal was accepted by 55 percent of voters.
Last month in Arizona, despite opposition generously funded by the food industry, the prohibition of containment boxes for calves and pigs was also approved by 62 percent of voters.
Neither Florida nor Arizona are particularly progressive states - both voted for George W. Bush against John Kerry in 2004.
The results of these two popular votes strongly suggest that if all Americans were voting on keeping pregnant pigs and calves in confinement, the vast majority would oppose.
Ultimately, it seems that Americans are equally concerned that the Europeans living conditions of farm animals.
To explain the difference between the well - being of farm animals in Europe and the United States - the United States, it is no doubt compare political systems.
In Europe, the concerns of voters about the living conditions of the animals were echoed by members of national parliaments and the European Parliament, resulting in the adoption of national legislation and EU directives to improve their lot.
States - United by against these same concerns have had no discernible effect on members of Congress.
There is no federal legislation on the well - being of livestock and virtually no legislation at the state level.
AB I think the tens of millions of dollars pocketed by the food industry representatives seeking re-election is for something.
The animal rights movement, despite strong popular support, is not the weight in the arena of political lobbying and election donations.
In American electoral races, the money is more important than the opinions of voters.
Party discipline is weak and delegates must bring self - the bulk of the funds for re-election - in this case, every two years for members of the House of Representatives.
In Europe, where party discipline is respected and where parties, not the candidates, finance election campaigns, money plays a less important role.
In the United - States, a country proud of its democratic tradition, calves and pigs are by far not the only losers.
What's new on the new fully-Afghan army?
The murder of Afghanistan's Minister of Aviation by a mob (can - be encouraged by members of the Interim Administration of Afghanistan clean) shows that Afghan society remains deeply fissured.
The first reforms of the Afghan army will only exacerbate these divisions.
The Minister of Defence of the temporary administration of Hamid Karzai in Kabul has already appointed senior officers of the new army.
The Minister, General Mohammed Fahim, is a Tajik from the Panjshir district in the North, which became three months earlier the head of the Northern Alliance forces that captured Kabul after American bombers they have cleared the way .
As a group, the assignment is a direct challenge to the goal of reunification of Mr. Karzai.
Afghanistan is a multi nation - ethnic, the largest group being Pashtuns, with two-fifths of the total population.
Hazaras and Tajiks constitute respectively a fifth of the population.
On thirty-eight high officers to the rank of General by Mr. Fahim, Thirty - seven are Tajiks, the thirty - eighth is an Uzbek.
If, on 15-17000000 Pashtuns of the country, some - some are recruited as soldiers, they will serve in an almost entirely of Tajiks command structure.
The language of the Pashtuns, however, differs from Tajik as Spanish and English, and millions of Pashtuns reaching the age of military service have at best some knowledge of Tajik.
The geographical profile of the new military authority is as narrow as its ethnic composition.
Thirty - five on thirty-eight senior officers are from a small area north of Kabul consisting of Parwan province (where the airport is located at Bagram) and the nearby Panjshir valley, along the bastion of the Northern Alliance.
In other words, potential leaders from of twenty - seven of the twenty - nine provinces of Afghanistan have been excluded from the new military elite of their country.
Such a small group could be - being overcome the impression that its members are a closed clique if they represented a large sample of the dozen countries political parties.
But this is not the case.
Ten - eight of thirty to eight senior officers just one party, the Jamiat - e - Islami, the Islamic faction that has long been led by mullah and former theology professor Burhanuddin Rabbani.
It was this party that ruled Kabul briefly in the mid-1990s, creating the bloodshed and chaos that caused most Afghans to welcome the coming of the Taliban.
The Communists almost equal number of members of the Jamiat in the military hierarchy.
Sixteen of the thirty - eight officers have long been aligned with this party tricks in the late 1970s led to the Soviet invasion of 1979-89 which cost two and a half million Afghan lives.
Most Afghans now believe the Communists with the same degree of sympathy that Czechs or Poles reserve for Hitler's National Socialists.
It is true that the Afghans, as elsewhere, joined the Communist Party for various reasons and they were by no means all hardened ideologues.
But in the case of General Fahim general, six were professional workers of the Communist Party and continued to serve the Party after the invasion of the Red Army.
These six men, plus three Communists who served as officers in the Afghan army, collaborated actively during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, which lasted a decade.
Imagine how the French would have reacted if a quarter of the French officer corps of the post - World War II had sided with the Wehrmacht during that - it occupied their country.
In Afghanistan, the news travels fast by word of mouth.
Afghan nationalists (that is - to - say almost all Afghans) will soon discover the political reasons members of the inner circle of General Fahim, if it is not already.
Even this overwhelming evidence of bias and prejudice in the formation of the high command of the new army could be neutralized if the generals incorporated professionalism and commitment to the patriotic values ‚Äã‚Äãtruly national armed forces in their task.
Unfortunately, only ten of thirty to eight officers promoted by Fahim trained professional military officers.
An eleventh served as a pilot.
In contrast, twenty-four on thirty-eight general (training of the remaining four generals remain unknown) are civilians, who had a profession, which come from the Communist Party offices or, in one case, which were mullah.
What do all these statistics in terms of everyday reality?
They mean that when the heads of international peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan, and the US military and diplomatic officials, meet under - Afghan Defense Minister, Abdul Rashid Dostum they will meet a warlord and Communist notoriously brutal and corrupt that remains in contact with old friends of the Red Army still serving in Moscow.
This means that the leader of the Afghan armed forces and the head of operations and head of army intelligence service are also Communists, men whose loyalties remain uncertain and many Afghans are wary.
This team has an opportunity to unify the war-torn Afghanistan?
The presence in Kabul of so dubious team has opportunities to infuse confidence among three - quarters of the Afghan population excluded from the military high command?
Or rather, this list is the harvest from a "all for the winner" of the government is obliged (at some point in the future) to unleash another bloody national reaction by those whose legitimate interests have been cynically trampled ?
The UN and the European and American politicians must ponder these questions before agreeing to a relentless takeover by a small unpopular minority.
Celebration of the irrational.
Hooray for the new winners of the Nobel Prize in economics Daniel Kahneman of Princeton University, and Vernon Smith of George Mason University in Virginia.
Like many Nobel Prize, these awards recognize not only the critical work undertaken by Messrs. Kahneman and Smith, but also the schools of thought they have helped develop.
Mr. Kahneman, a psychologist, found that individuals behave systematically less conventionally than traditional economists think.
His work shows not only that individuals sometimes act differently standard economic theoretical predictions, but they do regularly, systematically, and in a way that can be understood and interpreted through various hypotheses that compete with those used by mainstream economists.
For most market participants, and in fact ordinary observers, this does not seem to make much difference.
Wall Street brokers who traffic with actions they know are bad exploit the irrational Messrs. Kahneman and Smith have shown.
Much of the enthusiasm that led to swelling of the markets was based on exploiting investor psychology.
In fact, this irrationality is not new for economists either.
John Maynard Keynes once described the stock market as not being based on the struggle of rational individuals to discover the fundamentals of markets, but as a beauty contest in which the winner is the one who guesses the best ones that judges say .
The Nobel Prize this year celebrates the critique of simplistic market economy, like that of last year (I got two other colleagues).
The last year's laureates emphasized that different market participants have different information (and imperfect), and that this information asymmetry has a marked impact on the functioning of the economy.
Specifically, the winners of last year by - heard that markets are generally not effective; remaining governments a greater role to play.
The invisible hand of Adam Smith, the idea that free trade leads to efficiency as if guided by an invisible hand is invisible in part because it does not exist.
This, too, is not a new fact for those who work daily with the markets (and make fortunes by taking advantage of this information asymmetry and the excess).
For over twenty years, economists were passionate about these so - called "rational expectations" models which assumed that all players have the same information (however imperfect) and act perfectly rationally, that markets are perfectly effective, there is never any unemployment (except when caused by greedy unions or minimum wages imposed by governments), and there is never any rationing of funding.
Such models are predominant, particularly in graduate courses States - States, despite evidence to the contrary that demonstrate the triumph of ideology over science.
Unfortunately, students of these higher education programs today are the decision-makers in many countries and are trying to implement programs based on these ideas, we call market fundamentalism today.
Let - me be very clear here: the rational expectations models have contributed significantly to economic theory; rigor their defenders have imposed on economic thinking helped to highlight the weakness of many assumptions under - lying.
Good scientific thinking can recognize its limitations, but the prophets of rational expectations have generally shown little modesty.
Vernon Smith is a leader in the development of experimental economics, the idea that one can test many economic propositions in a laboratory.
One of the reasons why the economy is a complex subject, which also explains the many disagreements among economists, is that economists can not conduct controlled experiments.
Nature imbalance the life experience, but in most circumstances, so many things can change so quickly that it is often difficult to disentangle the causes of consequences.
In principle, in a laboratory, we can conduct controlled experiments, and therefore generate more reliable inferences.
Experimental economics of critics worry that subjects bring to experimental situations modes of thought determined outside of the experiment, and thus experiences and inferences are not as clear as detached and in the physical sciences.
Nevertheless, economic experiments provide some knowledge of a large number of issues, such as the improved design of auctions.
Above all, the irrationality of market participants, the main issue of the work of Mr. Kahneman, was checked repeatedly in the context of the laboratories.
One of the more amusing results generated by experimental economics falls altruism and selfishness.
It appears (at least in experimental situations) that experimental subjects are not as selfish as economists believe, except a group: the economists it - yourself.
Would - that because the economy is a discipline that attracts individuals who are by nature selfish or because the economy to mold individuals in order to make them more selfish?
The answer, surely, surely stands a little of both.
There is no doubt that the experimental research and future work will resolve this question of the relative importance of these two hypotheses.
The Nobel Prize shows how important it is to study people and economies as they are and not as we want them.
Only by better understanding the actual human behavior can we hope to design policies that will also help to better run our economies.
Bush and his energy policy in bad faith.
An episode of the Surrealists occurred this year at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Experts from the oil industry there explained that the melting of the polar ice cap - much faster than all the announced forecasts - not just a problem, but also an opportunity in that huge new amounts of oil will now be accessible.
Similarly, these specialists have recognized that the refusal of the States - United to sign the Law of the Sea, the international convention determining who has access to offshore sources of oil and other maritime mineral rights, presents a risk of conflict International.
However, they also emphasized the benefits: the oil industry, in its relentless pursuit of new reserves, need not beg Congress for the right to despoil Alaska.
President George W. Bush has an uncanny ability to not understand the important messages.
For years, it has become increasingly clear that energy policy is wrong.
Some members of his party even refer to a former energy bill, drafted by the oil industry as being very beneficial to all lobbyists.
While praising the virtues of the market economy, Bush has been only too willing to give huge subsidies to the oil industry, despite the growing deficits which the country is facing.
However, the market does not function properly when it comes to energy. Government intervention should take a sense totally opposed to that which the Bush administration has proposed.
The fact that Americans do not pay the price of pollution - and especially their enormous production of greenhouse gases - resulting from their energy waste causes a devaluation of energy prices and suddenly, excessive consumption .
The government needs to encourage energy savings. His intervention on pricing, primarily through energy taxes, is an effective method to do so.
But instead of promoting energy conservation, Bush has pursued a policy of "drain America first" of its own resources, making the future even more dependent on external oil resources.
Never mind that high demand drives up oil prices, creating a windfall for many countries in the Middle - East, which are not the best friends of America.
Now, more than four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, Bush appears to have finally woken up to the growing energy dependence of America. It became difficult for him to be unaware of the consequences of the rampant rise in oil prices.
But, once again, the hesitant gestures of his government will undoubtedly exacerbate problems in the immediate future.
Bush still refuses to take action to save energy and ultimately spending very little money to support his continual prayer technological salvation.
What, then, to the recent statement by Bush on its commitment to reduce, in 25 years, the oil dependence of America on the Middle - East 75%?
For investors, the message is clear: do not invest in new reserves of the Middle - East, which are by far the cheapest oil resources of the world.
Now, if there are no new investment in the reserves of the Middle - East, unbridled growth of energy consumption in the States - the US, China and elsewhere implies that demand exceeds supply.
And to top it all, Bush's threat of sanctions against Iran could cause disruption in the supply of one of the largest producers in the world.
With global oil production almost at its peak and prices have nearly doubled since the Iraq war, this portends still higher prices and even more profits for the oil industry, the only real winner Bush policy in the Middle - East.
Nevertheless, one should not begrudge Bush for having recognized that there was a problem.
But, as always, his proposals are nothing more than a little trick - Forgot administration.
Aside from refusing to admit global warming, encourage conservation, or to allocate sufficient funds to advance research, the great promise of Bush to reduce US dependence on oil from the Middle - East does not mean much.
With only 20% of US oil extracted in the Middle - East, the goal of Bush could simply be achieved by modestly increasing the supply from other regions.
The Bush administration must realize that oil takes advantage of the global market.
Even if America was completely independent of oil from the Middle - East, reduction of energy production in this region would have devastating effects on world prices and even more on the US economy.
As is too often the case with the Bush administration, there is no clear explanation of official policy.
Bush - there playing with politics shaking the feeling anti - Arab and anti - Iranian Americans?
Or - this just another example of incompetence and confusion?
Depending on what we saw in the last five years, the correct answer probably contains more than a little bad faith and sheer ineptitude.
The roadmap of China.
China is about to adopt its 11th five-year plan, setting the stage to extend what is probably the most remarkable economic transformation in history, while improving the well - being of almost a quarter of the world population .
Never before had the world seen such sustained growth; ever there was - there was such poverty reduction.
The explanation of the long-term success of China is partly due to its unique combination of pragmatism and vision.
While much of the rest of the developing world, according to the Washington Consensus, has embarked on a GDP increase quest worthy of Don Quixote, China has once again made it clear she was looking for sustainable increases and equitable real living standards.
China realizes that it has entered a phase of economic growth imposing enormous demands on the environment that can not last.
Unless we change course, living standards will eventually be compromised.
That is why the new five-year plan really focuses on the environment.
In many parts of China's most backward experienced such rapid growth that would be a marvel if other parts of the country knew growing faster still.
While this has reduced poverty, inequality has increased, with growing disparities between rural and urban areas, and between coastal regions and the interior.
The report of this year's World Bank World Development Report explains why inequality, not just poverty, should raise concern; or the 11th Five Year Plan of China addresses the problem frontally.
The Government refers several years a more harmonious society, and the plan describes ambitious programs for achieving this goal.
China also recognizes that what separates less developed countries of the developed countries is not only a disparity in resources but also knowledge.
It has therefore established ambitious projects to reduce these disparities and create a basis for independent innovation.
The role of China in the world and in the world economy has changed, and the plan reflects this situation.
Future growth will have to rely more on domestic demand than on exports, which implies an increase in consumption.
Indeed, China has a rare problem: excessive savings.
People save partly because of weaknesses in social insurance programs of government: strengthening social security (pensions), public health and education will simultaneously reduce social inequalities, increase feelings of well - being of citizens and promote current consumption.
If it worked (and so far China has almost always surpassed even its own high expectations) these adjustments may impose enormous strains on a global economic system already destabilized by the huge fiscal and trade imbalances States - States.
If China saves less - and if, as announced by its representatives, it pursues a more diversified policy of investing its reserves, which will finance the trade deficit of over $ 2 billion per day States - States?
It is a subject to talk another day, but that day is can - not be so far away.
With such a clear vision of the future, the challenge will be implementation.
China is a big country, which would not have succeeded as it has without widespread decentralization.
But decentralization raises problems of its own.
Greenhouse gases, for example, are global problems.
While America says that it can not afford to do anything about it, the most senior Chinese officials have acted more responsibly.
In the space of one month after the adoption of the plan, new environmental taxes on cars, gasoline, and wood products were imposed: China uses market mechanisms to solve its environmental problems and those of world.
But the pressure on the leaders of local governments to create economic growth and jobs will be enormous.
They will be very tempted to say that if America is not able to produce in order to protect our planet, how could the other - they?
To translate this vision into action, the Chinese government will need strong policies, including substantial increases in taxes on the environment.
While China has moved toward a market economy, it has developed some problems that have plagued the developed countries: special interests concealing personal interests under market ideology mask.
Some will argue trickle - down effect: do not worry about the poor, eventually everybody will eventually benefit from growth.
And others oppose competition policy and strict corporate governance laws: let Darwinism work its wonders.
Growth arguments will be advanced to counter strong social and environmental policies: for example, increasing gasoline taxes will kill our nascent auto industry.
Such policies so - called pro - growth will not only fail to deliver growth, they would threaten the entire vision of China.
There is only one way to prevent this: open discussion of economic policies in order to expose fallacies and provide the means to implement creative solutions to the many challenges that China faces today.
George W. Bush as it is shown the dangers of excessive secrecy and confining decision-making to a narrow circle of sycophants.
Most people outside China do not realize how its leaders, by contrast, have engaged in extensive deliberations and broad consultations (even with foreigners) as they strive to solve the enormous problem they are facing.
Market economies are not self - regulatory.
They can not simply be left on autopilot, especially if one wants to ensure that their benefits are widely shared.
But managing a market economy is not easy.
It is a balancing act that must constantly respond to economic changes.
The 11th Five-Year Plan of China provides a roadmap in this direction.
The world opens his eyes full of hope and fear, while the lives of 1.3 billion people continue to be transformed.
The lessons on democracy Tocqueville.
Because of the Iraq war, 200 years after the birth of Tocqueville, the world discusses the nature of democracy.
Tocqueville is justly famous for rejecting reactionary nostalgia and regarding democracy was our destiny, while warning against the dangers it holds for liberty.
Have - we share his concern?
Tocqueville did not see the first democracy as a political system, but primarily as an intellectual system that shapes the ways and customs of society, thus giving it a sociological and psychological dimension.
Tocqueville believed that democratic systems guide the course of our thoughts, our desires and our passions.
Also there was the man of the Renaissance and the twentieth century, homo Sovieticus, "democratic man" is a form of the human being.
For Tocqueville, the systemic effects of democracy could lead citizens to renounce their reasoning faculty.
They can only pretend to judge events and values ‚Äã‚Äãself - when in fact they just repeat the simplified opinions of the majority.
What Tocqueville called the hold of "social power" on opinion is probably strongest in democratic regimes - a view that foretells the growth of demagogy and media manipulation in the modern world.
Tocqueville believed that in the long run, nothing can really oppose this trend.
Neither local democracy nor small groups within the company, nor against - governments, nor civil rights, can prevent the decline of critical thought that democracy seems to cause.
The school is at best an enclave away from the irresistible influence that society has on the mind.
Similarly, Tocqueville thought that pursuing virtue as the ancients in or religious faith could sometimes elevate the soul, but one and the other are incompatible with the democratic ideal from the moment they imposed by the authorities as part of public life.
In this sense, the neo theorists - Marxists of the Frankfurt School and Hannah Arendt who feared by - above all the disintegration of reason in modern societies are the heirs of Tocqueville's thought.
It is also noted that the French philosopher Marcel Gauchet entitled a recent book Democracy against it - yourself.
For these authors, the democratic way of life tends to destroy original thought and to prevent the emergence of a culture of good level, giving way to a mediocrity that leaves citizens vulnerable to the enemies of democracy.
If history is replete with murderous regimes applauded by cowed and deceived masses, the largest democratic country risk is that their citizens withdraw into apathy and limited to a short-term thinking in search of their immediate interest .
The past - despite rituals that seek to commemorate historic events - is masked by the dependence of the moment and the latest novelty.
Even the ruling class, supposedly well-educated is subject to this bewitchment.
The main problem of the democratic mind is its lack of historical consciousness.
As Tocqueville claimed, the defects of democracy are - that resigned pessimism is the only - realistic but unsustainable - path open to us?
I do not think so.
There are ways to combat what might be called "democratic stupidity" that we see spread today.
The first way is to develop an educational system that form of real critics, particularly through the teaching largely neglected subjects (today) that are literature, history and philosophy.
If we want to train citizens informed and able to think for themselves - same, which is essential to the functioning of democracy, our schools must stop pandering to the latest popular fads and begin to develop analytical capacity students.
Because of their tendency to cultivate superficiality and amusement, the mass media are the main obstacle to such education.
Today, many people spend more time in their lives watching television than in a classroom.
The passivity that mass media encourages is the polar opposite of the active engagement of citizens for democracy.
But it is hard to imagine that the mass media (other than quality newspapers) would, of their own volition, become instruments of an education that enhances citizens' critical capacities.
This concern about mass media is no mere elitist scorn for popular culture.
This is not just a matter of popularity - Mozart was popular in his day, and Shakespeare's plays attracted the poor as the rich - but the refusal of the mass culture to challenge and provoke.
The result is a generalized indifference and passivity of the public.
For a long time a globalized media culture increasingly unable to raise any critical or raise feelings.
Because of its lack of interest in these issues, it is a culture that threatens democratic freedom because it creates in no way a sense of duty towards society, history or community.
Is - it too late to defend against a culture that so deadens the spirit?
Tocqueville despised the elites of his time for their complacency about the dangers of mass democracy.
Myopia of our leaders it will facilitate the achievement of its disturbing prophecy?
A Europe for all.
Members of longstanding EU seem to doubt the future of the European Union, but the Ukrainians look to the European Union with a hope and a certain admiration.
The fundamental objective of our foreign policy is to integrate ourselves to European progress, because Ukraine has discovered that nationhood is not an end in itself but merely a beginning.
Indeed, European unity is indivisible: when one nation is ostracized, no nation is free.
We, Europeans, all linked by a bond which we can not escape, bound in a single destiny.
Every aspect of our shared culture, not to speak of the century of suffering that we have to share, we confirm this.
Whatever affects one European directly, affects all indirectly.
We will never be able to afford to live with the narrow notion of two Europes, a Europe of wealthy and poor in Europe, elected officials and banned.
Anyone who lives on the European continent today can in fact should be considered a stranger to its Union.
The great Pax Europa today, as the current pan-European prosperity depends on it.
Some will say of course that Ukraine is not part of Europe.
Let them come to Kyiv and meet its people, young and old, workers, farmers' wives, lawyers and doctors and teachers who stood and remained standing in the cold and snow for weeks to defend freedoms last winter.
Are - they not united with those who gathered around General de Gaulle in the French Resistance?
Do - they not one with those who died in battle in defense of the Spanish Republic in the 1930s, those who liberated Budapest in 1956 and put an end to fascism in Spain and Portugal in the 1970s?
Are - they not animated by the same spirit as that of the Polish trade union Solidarnosc and peaceful masses amorc√®rent the Velvet Revolution in Prague in 1989?
This is the real soul of Europe and no doubt will destroy it.
To those who believe that Ukraine is too backward for membership in the Union, I will say this: they too come to visit my country and see the mothers who stay late at the office to teach their children the use of the computer in the office.
They just attend language classes in every village and city where our youth is preparing for Europe by learning French, German and English.
Those who doubt the European vocation of Ukraine should understand that Europe is not a matter of hardware and highways: the insatiable desire for freedom, prosperity and solidarity.
I believe that our future is as promising as Europe's past is proud, and that our destiny is not that of an ancient land borders in a troubled region but of a participant influence of peace and of unity of Europe.
Self-determination no longer means isolation, because achieving national independence nowadays simply means the return on the world scene with a new status.
New nations can build with their former occupiers the same kind of fruitful relationship that France established with Germany: a relationship based on equality and mutual interests.
This is the type of relationship that my government wants to establish with Russia, this is how we can help extend the zone of peace in Europe.
It is premature, of course, to go to - beyond the indication of the high regard we attach to the possibility of joining the European Union.
We know that our part in that great edifice will not be built overnight.
We know that the great works of European unification are not limited to documents and statements, but are rooted in innovative action designed to improve living standards and bring security to all Europeans.
Building a Ukraine worthy of joining the European Union will not be easy, quick or effortless.
But just as the European Union itself - well, it will be built and it will happen.
We know the challenge is great but the game is worth the candle and Europe must understand that this is our goal.
The renovation of the Ukraine passes in part by an innovative battle to end a nightmarish century during which fascism and communism, ideologies born in the heart of Europe, competed to take power.
Through Ukrainian cities there are a few more months, parents and children confronted armed troops, snarling dogs and even death.
There are only a few years yet, a young journalist, Georgi Gongadze, seeking to inform the public about the corruption of our former regime, was brutalized and beheaded by the henchmen of the regime.
Our Orange Revolution last winter, proved that Ukraine and its people could win.
Thus, despite the doubts and difficulties, I retain an unwavering confidence in Europe.
I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities and horrors of history of Ukraine.
I refuse to accept the idea that Ukraine is so tragically bound to live in the heart of the starless night of the communist legacy to the point of never being able to see the daybreak of peace and true unity European.
When citizens of the European Union reflect on the place of Ukraine in Europe, they will look closely and know how to look at - beyond the face we show them.
See - beyond the devastated areas that we inflicted communism in - beyond poverty and social divisions through which our elders today repudiated leaders have sought to extend their hand up.
Rather, they will look closely at the face of our president, Viktor Yushchenko, ravaged by poison that was administered during the election campaign last year and remember the words of that great French that was Andr√© Malraux, for whom "the most beautiful faces are those that have been injured."
Muslim civil war.
The gap between Sunnis and Shiites in the Middle - East is - he now deeper than the antagonism between Israel and the Arabs?
One might think seeing the reaction of some Arab governments to Hezbollah's decision to attack Israel.
As Israeli bombs fell on Beirut and Tyre, Saudi Arabia, can - perhaps the most conservative Arab Muslim state of all, openly condemned the actions of the Shia Hezbollah initiated the conflict against Israel.
Never before in the history of the Arab - Israeli conflict, a state that considers itself the leader of the Arab Muslim people had supported Israel so openly.
In addition, the breakdown of Saudi Arabia with Hezbollah is not a unique case.
Egypt and Jordan have also roundly condemned Hezbollah and its leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, for their adventurism.
What's Behind this astonishing situation?
About - we experiencing a fundamental shift in relations between Arab nationalism and Islamic sectarianism?
Sunni government of Saudi Arabia feels - it more fear and concern about Shiite Islam that it is involved in Arab unity and the Palestinian cause?
The denunciations of Hezbollah by Arabs suggest that the Muslim sectarian divide, already evident in the daily violence in Iraq, is deepening and intensifying across the Middle - East.
The will of President George W. Bush to destroy the frozen societies of the Arab world was doomed to pit the forces of modernization against the traditional elements of Islamic and Arab societies.
It seems instead to have released the most atavistic forces in the region.
Opening this Pandora's box could give rise to an even more horrible era of generalized violence, to what can only be described perhaps as "Muslim civil war."
Shiite divide - Sunni existed since the dawn of the history of Islam, but the geographical and ethnic isolation of non-Shiite Iran - Arabic, as well as the dominance of their Shia minorities in Sunni Arab countries, has usually left this rivalry back - plan.
These tensions have declined more in wave "Islamization" created by the Iranian revolution, for in its wake sectarian Sunni Arab identity was further pushed to the back - plane that appeared as an affirmation "Islamic "generalized.
That all changed when Al Qaeda, a Sunni terrorist group that is largely inspired by ideology and Saudi wahabbites personnel, launched its attacks against America in September 2001.
A specifically Sunni branch of Islam militant was running.
When States - States launched wars against both Sunni Taliban in Afghanistan and against Iraq's Sunni regime, this new radical Sunni trend has gained even more daring.
Sunni Arabs in the region, which have now gained confidence, see Israel and the West as a single threat, the other comprising the so-called "Shia crescent" - the arc of land extending from Lebanon to Iran through Syria and Iraq, inhabited by the supposed Shia heretics.
The leaders of Saudi Arabia, as custodians of sacred sites of the Muslim faith in Mecca and Medina, feel may - be this threat more acute.
For Sunnis, Shiites are not content to dominate the oil-rich regions of Iran, Iraq and parts of eastern Saudi Arabia, they also try, by the actions of Hezbollah, to usurp the role of "protector" of the central dream of all Arabs, the Palestinian cause.
This is because the Saudi royal family derives its legitimacy from a strict form of Sunni Islam and doubts the loyalty of its Shia population that the Kingdom deviates from Hezbollah.
The irony is that America, protective longtime Saudi Arabia, made the decision possible Shiite responsibility overthrowing Saddam Hussein and bringing Shiite parties to power in Iraq.
The Bush administration seems to recognize what it has done; as the Shia arc rises in the east of the Arab Muslim world, the United - States is trying to strengthen the protection of the Sunni arc - Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia - to west of the region.
Israel, once implacable enemy of the Arab cause, now seems embedded in this defensive structure.
But such a defensive position is necessarily unstable, by the mere fact of the pan-Arab feelings.
Today, ordinary Saudi citizens are glued to Al Jazeera and other Arab satellite TV networks to follow events in Gaza and southern Lebanon.
They see Arab blood flow (not Shiite) and Hezbollah only answer.
For them, Hezbollah has become a heroic resistance model.
This pushes the Saudi state to extend the Sunni schism - Shiite.
After the official denunciation of Hezbollah by the Kingdom, the Saudi state called on its official Wahhabi clergy to issue fatwas condemning Hezbollah as a heretic and Shiite deviant.
Such sentences can only exacerbate sectarian divisions within Saudi Arabia and the region.
Faced with the worsening of these antagonisms, Sunni regimes will eventually - they to believe that they need their own Hezbollah to fight in their corner?
If they reach this conclusion, they will not need to look far because the fighters of this type have already undergone training - provided by Al Qaeda.
Why Europe can no longer ignore Georgia.
The time when Europe could rely on America to wage war, restore peace and democracy in its own backyard is over.
With the enlargement of the European Union, as demonstrated by the recent Russian gas crisis, this court now includes not only Ukraine but also Georgia.
Indeed, Georgia, as in Ukraine, democracy is tested and Europe can not afford to ignore it.
Georgia was the first country in the post - Soviet space to operate his "color revolution" and thus to demonstrate, with dignity and maturity, its people's choice for democracy and European values.
The flags of the European Union that float on all Georgian public buildings since then clearly show the natural attachment, as old as the history of this country, which for the ancient Greeks, was an integral part of the world at the time.
Prometheus, Medea, the Amazons and neighboring Armenia Noah's ark, are all signs that Europe of our myths starts there.
Through its history, its culture, its traditions, old but latest when Georgia differed from other republics of the former USSR, for critical thinking, independent and even rebellious, Georgia is probably still the location of this space where democratic transplant can take at best.
It is therefore all the more disturbing to see the democratization of the country threatened.
Everything seemed to have started well enough.
With the launch without a shot being fired from a policy of reforms, privatization, fight against corruption, the search for new frameworks and thus free of compromises with the previous regime, the implementation of a foreign policy marked by a return Europe in the Georgian game.
The state of totalitarianism has since resurfaced in these leaders, proclaiming the representatives of the majority, appropriated more and more powers.
It's a caste that such hydra with a thousand heads never ceases to die and rise from the ashes.
Those - there and their methods of power that the "Rose Revolution" in November 2003 would once and for all redact have reintroduced the heart of power, using their networks with ramifications including across borders their considerable financial weight, their ability to intrigue and manipulation of political and electoral devices.
It is a power that does not sufficiently respect the essence of democracy is not at the ballot box but in the separation and balance of powers.
Each day, the government gets the legislative, the vast majority of laws are written in the presidential chancellery; Parliament wants to control the daily exercise of government policy, including, in my case, the appointment of ambassadors and their daily functioning!
Finally, and this is the most serious, the judiciary is still unable to break free from the control of the executive and represents more or not for the citizen or investor guarantor and protector, without where there is no rule of law, or economic freedom.
This is a company to be democratic in his head, is not yet in the legs. She hesitates to engage in political leaving the scene to those who occupy it for too long.
Because this democracy is in danger switch, but because it is still there, a strong presence in the population, in civil society organizations, in a press which, though that does not lose its critical faculty ...
It's time for Europe to save democracy in order not to annihilate all those hopes.
States - States has already done what they could, since independence, and they are alongside the Georgian stability.
Stability was certainly not identified with democracy under the rule of Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs that the Rose Revolution was dismissed from his position as President of Georgia.
But Americans invested generously in the survival of the Georgian elite and their learning of democracy.
The criticism of Soros initiatives now in fashion, seems more unjustified: the November Revolution was not created from scratch by the Americans, no offense to the propaganda of Russian nationalists too accustomed to interventions direct order to think differently, but the Democratic substrate that has allowed was certainly fed, encouraged and supported by grants from the Soros Foundation.
The course that must be crossed today that Georgia evacuates his organization - this time d√©finitivement- totalitarian evil, is a complex step that requires support of a different kind, that Europeans are more likely to provide .
Models that should be proposed for the balance of power, state institutions of law, the functioning of the judicial or local democracy must be inspired by European forms closer to Georgian reality than Anglo - Saxon model, American variant.
If Europe today rejected this task, it would betray its fundamental duty to this country, small, Mediterranean, flexible, long historical tradition, where democracy has a much better chance of success in Ukraine, which is entirely both very large and still very Soviet in his mind, not to mention Central Asia.
Do not help Georgia, is to accept that democracy and stability are so long to come not only in Tbilisi, but even more in Kiev, Minsk, to say nothing of Moscow.
It is above all take a very serious risk.
Moscow, with ups and downs, endless procrastination, an inner turmoil, began to be resigned to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdemocratic inevitability, at least on its circumference, but not without renouncing its imperial dreams and instruments domination, could suddenly see his perception.
This hesitant resignation, acceptance of normality in its relations with its neighbors, which was still in its infancy, can be swept away by a sudden eruption of the irrational of Russian power that too famous "Derjava" who can not resist the lure of the weak, the emptiness, the temptation to be re not the same, but the strongest.
This is why the recent Russian gas crisis.
Any sign of decline in democracy, slowing democratic wave, will be taken by Moscow as a foolish hope of reversibility where Russia gradually became accustomed to not believe it.
It is the responsibility of Europe to convince Russia that it twists its way to hope in a return to the past.
Europe has this responsibility in relation to it - even at its future energy independence. It also has the responsibility to demonstrate that there are also strong European values ‚Äã‚Äã- freedom, democracy, justice among peoples.
For that Europe must develop the instruments of its policy: a large public-private foundation for Europe and democracy, a university to train managers of tomorrow democracies are still looking, font, an army of judges and magistrates who keep close company models that we want to convert.
Europe needs above belief.
If Europe does not suit her - she was even interested in the fate of its neighbors, their democracy and the future of its values ‚Äã‚Äãand spread, so that believeth on him tomorrow?
Berlusconi at bay.
Silvio Berlusconi, who will become president of the European Union on 1 July, is a man of vision who once loved to take risks and trade paris which proved profitable. In the 1960s, he was the first to see that Milan, then a traditional Italian city where people walked to work, would become a modern metropolis, surrounded by American-style suburbs.
He built his fortune in real estate expansion.
Fifteen years later, Mr. Berlusconi understood that the monopoly held by the Italian state on television would not survive and he then set up what would become the first private media group in Italy.
But it would not have been able to accomplish so much in television as in real estate if he had not had adequate political relations.
In both cases, Berlusconi won out over its competitors by siding with the Socialists at the time the rising stars of Italian political life.
His long association with Bettino Craxi, the most influential politician in Milan in the 1970s and Prime Minister of Italy in much of the 1980s, was born early.
On the other hand, political relations are not enough to become a politician.
Indeed, spending trade policy certainly was not part of Berlusconi's wishes.
His media group, weakened by excessive diversification (the decision to enter the retail distribution market had practically destroyed), encountered difficulties in the 1990s.
Almost simultaneously, the former Prime Minister Craxi fled to Tunisia, chased by the Italian courts in connection with a corruption investigation mani pulite conducted in the extensive network known as Tangentopoli (Bribesville).
Flight and exile Craxi created a sense of loss at Berlusconi by taking away the strong political support he needed.
So he decided to become his own political sponsor.
As has often been the case in Italian history, Berlusconi's decision to form a new political party (Forza Italia) a few months before the parliamentary elections in 1994 has paid off.
Berlusconi's lack of political experience led to the fall of his first government six months later.
Any other man as rich as Berlusconi would probably have given up.
But he persisted and led the opposition for six years.
In 2001, his determination was rewarded with a clear victory and, more importantly, a seemingly doomed to change the mandate.
Once again, Berlusconi has probably had no choice: in the late 1990s, his association with the disgraced Socialists pursued him both politically and legally.
His only hope to push the magistrates was to control parliament and introduce new laws to stop the series of corruption trials that lurked a strategy that allows it to escape prosecution until his term takes end.
Unfortunately, while Berlusconi's government is invariably never short speeches, legal provisions in place to suspend trials are among the few laws that have been taken during his two years in power.
The achievements of the government Berlusconi combine good intuition (for example, the attempt to reform Italian pensions in 1994) and Poor enforcement (mainly through lack of courage, as surprising as it seems to be).
In 1994, during his first term, he understood early on that Italy needed to reform its pension system and therefore introduced a bold legislation.
But one general strike proved enough to kill his reformist zeal.
Most recently, he courageously sided with the United - States in the war in Iraq, against the majority of the country and his own political coalition.
But soon after that he appeared frightened by his own courage and he then became an almost invisible ally.
Despite its rhetoric, Berlusconi did not attend (or was not invited) to the summit with President Bush in the Azores, where the final decision was made to go to war.
Concerning social reforms, he fought the unions, but not delivering the good fight: the infamous "Article 18" of Italy, which allows labor courts to reinstate an employee in his job if a judge finds he was fired unfairly.
But while Article 18 is important in principle, it is almost irrelevant in practice.
It only served to provoke a confrontation with the unions and the government to divert much more important social reforms.
Contrary to what happened in 1994, the government of Berlusconi remains, but those who hoped for a free-market revolution will be disappointed.
No significant tax reduction was passed and the pension reform is still awaited.
The powerful Finance Minister Berlusconi Giulio Tremonti often and naively speaks of the need to renew the government intervention in the economy; no action is taken to prevent strikes in the public transport sector.
Right moderate voters, who wanted an Italian version (ie, somewhat watered-down) of the Reagan / Thatcher era are disillusioned.
Berlusconi tries to mask his inactivity by scaring his voters, repeating again and again that the election of the moderate left would be to sign a pact with the devil (ie the Communists).
Italians seem smarter, as clearly demonstrated the results of local elections in June.
Why courageous visionary 1960s and 1970s it lost its luster?
This is partly explained by the fact that we are not in this context: Berlusconi is 40 and for the last ten years he has lived in the world of Roman politics.
He learned the art of political survival (and personal), but he lost his vision and risk appetite.
Bridging the technology gap European American.
In the second half of the 1990s, the average annual growth rate of productivity in Europe was 0.7% while the United - States showed 1.4%.
However, if we distinguish between the industries that produce information and communication technologies (ICT) and those who are content to use these technologies, it appears that the productivity growth gap is due almost entirely on the weakness of the European ICT production sector.
Annual productivity growth in sectors that use ICT technologies has averaged 0.63% in the United - States between 1995 and 2000 against 0.41% in Europe.
This confirms a well known fact: Europe is less efficient than the United - States to conduct research leading to innovations either because Europe allocates fewer resources to research, or because the available resources are used less efficiently, or both.
It is certain that the total expenditure on research and development is lower in Europe than in - United States, but not by much.
In the 1990s, the United - States spent every year 2.8% of their GDP to research and development, against 2.3% for Germany, 2% in the UK and 1.9% in France.
European governments continued as usual to complain about the lack of fiscal resources to support research and development (a far fetched argument given the miniscule share of spending allocated to research in oversized European budgets) and each Once the European Commission authorizes them, they subsidize innovative firms, or those that they think are most likely to invest in research and development.
France and Italy, for example, demanded that the limits on budget deficits of euro zone members by the Stability and Growth Pact exclude public spending on research.
Similarly, the French government decided to get out Alstom, a company that has developed a number of high-tech products, including the TGV, the French fast train business before it is bankrupt.
But it is highly unlikely that these two tactics used to develop the European high-tech sector.
Why?
Because weakness in research does not, at least not primarily, a funding problem.
Grants will not create high efficient technology companies.
Consider first the matter of research.
Europe is lagging behind the United - States in each area: the number of patents, the number of Nobel laureates, the number of researchers in other countries it can attract.
But funding is only the visible part of the problem.
A euro spent on research in Europe is less productive than a dollar spent in the United - States for this purpose, for two reasons: the motivations and technology application.
We fear that additional expenditure not followed by a changing archaic university rules only serve to produce more waste and no more discoveries.
They would only increase the power, prestige and lobbyists resources unshakable university professors established compounds that often impede access and competition within their university.
Demand for technology also plays an important role.
It allows you to focus research, imposes deadlines, sifts the results of research and evaluates patents according to the market price.
Without the incentives provided by the people benefiting from these search results, the search is likely to drift, often without specific direction.
Admittedly, this does not apply to all areas: the study of ancient Greek fragments is valuable even if it rarely responds to a request.
But is important in areas, both theoretical and practical, that could be the basis for the production of new technologies: physics, biology, chemistry, technique, etc ..
But it is defense spending that are the main engine of search request.
Most of the technological advances of the period of post - war (micro - chips to the Internet until new batteries for cellular phones developed for the US military in Iraq) had, at least initially, a military application.
Cell phones, satellite tracking and high-resolution cameras are expensive, but fortunately for the industries that use them, their development costs were defrayed in part by the government.
A major reason for the superiority of the United - States on research is due to the size and composition of defense expenditure.
The Pentagon budget is not only important, it represents more than half of all US government spending on research and development; in France, defense expenditure is around only a quarter of the total.
In 1999, US spending on research and defense-related development reached 0.45% of GNP - head of the UK and France that have achieved only half of that figure, with 0.26% and 0, 22%, respectively.
As suggested by the Alstom affair, the French have a different model in mind.
Rather than support research and development with high defense budgets, they prefer to do it directly subsidizing French high-tech companies.
The official justification states that national defense budgets are too small to create the demand needed to support research and development in high-tech sectors, while there is still no European defense budget.
It is not a coincidence: if awarded in a spirit of competition, such a supranational budget designate winners and losers.
But many European countries still refuse to accept that some of their high-tech companies could not be equal: they think it is better to preserve these enterprises through generous subsidies and avoid between - time consolidation of European defense budgets.
By integrating its defense expenditures and increasing their size, Europe would do with one stone.
It would be more credible when it demands to be heard at international bargaining tables, particularly vis - a - vis the United - States, and it would stimulate scientific research.
To achieve this, it must not maintain larger deficits, which merely imply higher taxes, but reduce spending in other areas of the budget.
In other words: a sacrifice short-term gain for long term.
Debt to the US.
After nearly fifteen years of unprecedented growth - with only a brief slowdown in 2000/2001 - States - United considerably indebted abroad, up to 25% of GDP.
With a current account deficit which now exceeds 5% of GDP, the external debt of the United - States is increasing rapidly.
Yet no country can indefinitely into debt, and this should be completed sooner or later.
In early 1985, when the current account deficit of the United - States reached $ 120 billion - the equivalent of a third of the current deficit - the world had stopped funding it.
The dollar was then brutally devalued by 50% against the Deutschemark.
Europe has no interest in renewing this experience.
In reality, the world can not afford a loss - sudden - the current account deficit of the United - States.
Without exports to the United - States, growth timid that Europe has experienced over the past year would vanish.
The process may - already be happening: the valuation of the euro - $ 1.20 to $ 1.30 in recent months - was enough to paralyze European growth for the end of this year.
Before the fall of the dollar, exports of the 25 EU Member States increased by 6.5% per year, against 2% for consumption and 3% for investment.
In Japan, the recent recovery was almost entirely led by exports.
But the yen appreciates in value and growth there also seems to stop.
While central banks around the world are full of dollars and trade imbalances are becoming a concern, there are three possible solutions.
First, an increase in public saving in the United - States.
It is unlikely, at least in the near future, given President Bush's ambitious projects in tax matters and the continuation of the war in Iraq.
The US private savings are also slightly negative, and an increase could lead to a slowdown in the short-term activity.
Second, a more pronounced devaluation of the dollar, well - above its current value against the euro and the yen.
A revaluation of the Chinese yuan would also be a good thing.
Third, a resumption of growth in Europe, which would cause an increase in exports of the United - States.
This would mean that European companies cut costs and increase productivity.
As always in these cases - there are promised a variety of "structural reforms", but none is likely to be implemented soon.
So what to do?
One possibility would be to increase working time without a proportional increase in the hourly wage.
In the early 70s, we worked the same number of hours on both sides of the Atlantic.
Today, in France and Germany, working on average 50% less than in the United - States.
This is partly explained by higher European taxation, and in this respect nothing is possible: it can not be required to work a person who considers that his salary after taxes is not worth the trouble.
But the relative decline of working time is also due to the success of the unions, who have obtained the mandatory leave.
Reform in this area, for an extension of working time, would not reduce the total income of employees, but would reduce production costs.
This idea began to be discussed in the press and hopefully - the behind the scenes among politicians and union leaders.
Meanwhile, the rest of the world has an interest in what the United - States retain a deficit of unprecedented current account, priced at $ 500 billion per year.
This allows the Chinese to maintain the stability of their currencies against the dollar to remain extremely competitive, and to gradually move 200 million agricultural workers in the industry, the authorities' objective for the next decade.
In Europe, the US external deficit keeps the sole source of growth.
But this can not last.
One day or another, Europe will have to stop thinking that the states - the US can save its economy and will rely on its own resources.
But do not be surprised if the United - States and the devaluation of the dollar are accused of the next downturn in the European economy.
A scapegoat is always useful.
Abba Eban: The Voice of Israel.
For almost two generations, Abba Eban has represented the voice of Israel acting as his messenger to preservatives and powerful nations and the Jewish people worldwide.
Since its first appearance with Dr. Chaim Weizmann in the late 1940s during the struggle for Jewish independence and sovereignty, only a very small number of people expressed so clearly the Zionist and Jewish affair as eloquently and belief.
With his prose churchilienne and Shakespearean cadences, his mellifluous phrases and bombastic voice transmitted for decades the message of hope of a people that could have lost all hope and trust in humanity after the horrors of the Second War World.
As Ambassador of the United - States and the UN, and then as Foreign Minister, he represented an Israel with which the liberal imagination of the world could identify.
The most important and powerful nations envied a door - so powerful speech and speeches became classic examples for statesmen and diplomats in distant countries.
His books, he found time to write despite the hectic demands of diplomacy, formed the unique combination of colossal scholarship and comprehensibility of the clarity of the crystal.
His academic background and gifts for rhetoric complemented each other to form a single whole.
Rarely a small country was represented by a statesman of such scope: only Thomas Masaryk and Jan Smuts can bear comparison.
He was a true patriot, in the old sense of the word: proud of his people without being ethnocentric, however, a man of the world, but deeply rooted in the Jewish cultural heritage, focusing on the plight and tribulations of the Jewish people but never losing the universal horizon of mankind.
In a word, it was a modern Jew in the best sense of the term.
It has often been said that the Prime Minister Levi Eshkol spoke seven languages, all in Yiddish.
On Eban, one could say that he spoke ten and all with a focus Oxford / Cambridge.
However, what appealed to the outside world does not always constitute an advantage in the heart of the harshness and the collapse of Israeli policy.
Eban was perhaps too refined, too academic and too man in the world to achieve the hoist, as was so well expressed Disraeli, to the top of the greasy pole.
Accompanied by Golda Meir and Moshe Dayan, he had to leave the government in 1974 after the Yom Kippur War.
It could hardly be held responsible for the hubris that triggered the avalanche of 1973, but nevertheless these events led to his downfall.
He could never return to power and even when faced with the new policy of primary and populism, he felt dejected because he could not stand this new style.
In the international arena, Eban's pen he took the place of the sword and the word was his spear.
He was less adroit in political infighting in Israel.
He could be a fierce fighter on the turf, however, it is fairer to say that he could have fought harder to defend his moderate and dovish convictions in the government post - 1967 in which he participated.
It is not clear whether he would have won because of its lack of independent political base, but its prestige and reputation internationally could give him a chance if he had chosen to take up the gauntlet .
He never did.
Eban's silence in recent years was not only prompted by his disillusionment with Israeli policy nor by his declining health.
At a time when public debate in Israel are torn between nationalist fanatics nickname - Religious and anti - Zionists masquerading as post - modernists, the moral certitudes of Eban, impregnated know - life may seem superficial.
But to build a country, it is essential to have a certain moral strength and Eban was offered in abundance to his people and to the world.
Although it has passed several years since I've spoken to Eban, I did not doubt for a second the fact that it would have been extremely sad to see the turn of events after the failure of negotiations Camp David and Taba in 2000 - 2001 and conduct adopted by the Israeli policy it seems ominous.
However, in all likelihood, it would have been even more disappointed by the failure of the Palestinians to reach an agreement on the existence of the Jewish state.
As a pro - Arabic by training, immersed in Arab culture and Muslim culture, he always hoped that the glorious Arab past could be rejuvenated, that Arab and Muslim culture of tolerance could triumph over fanaticism and the extremism.
This was the foundation of his hope for reconciliation between Jews and Arabs.
That this Arab renaissance, to use the phrase of the great Palestinian academic George Antonius, did not see the day could have been the biggest disappointment Eban.
Despite the man's image of the world gave Eban, it was extremely vulnerable: what some would call sometimes pride traits could draw its source from its humble origins.
While speaking in a very neat English, Eban was not born in a castle: he had a fringe of Anglo - Jews.
He was, in the true sense of the word a "self - made man" whose courage, ambition, drive and a deep faith in his destiny led to the summit.
His mind was sailing in high places.
In this Abba Eban was a true representative of the people he represented so gloriously.
A practical guide to the Israeli hawks.
The announcement of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon indicating its willingness to dismantle Jewish settlements in Gaza and some West Bank settlements has shocked and unprepared the Israeli nation and nations around the world.
Many denounced Sharon's plan as a stratg√®me.
But the surprise was crazy from the start.
Despite the appearance they give to foreigners, the debate in Israel about the future of the occupied territories have not been reduced to a simple story of hawks and doves.
Like everything in Israel, the process is more complex, especially where the hawks are concerned.
Overall, there are two species of Israeli hawks: the ideological and strategic.
Ideological hawks view the occupied territories as part of the historical Land of Israel, the homeland of the Jewish people.
For them, the territories covered by the Jewish heritage, which explains their insistence on calling the West Bank by its Hebrew historical appellation Judea and Samaria.
Ideological hawks are not all religious, although those who are base their claim on divine promises and prophecies.
But many ideological hawks are secular nationalists, and their jargon is similar to that of nationalist types of Eastern Europe and Central Europe.
Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir belonged to that category.
Ideological hawks usually belong to the National Religious Party and the Likud.
They are inspired by a nationalist ideology associated with Vladimir Jabotinsky, who founded Zionism "revisionist" to challenge the more moderate version adopted by the Founding Fathers of Israel, including Chaim Weizmann and David Ben - Gurion.
Then there are the strategic hawks.
For them, given the narrow and vulnerable geographic shape of Israel and the continued hostility of the Arabs, the control of the West Bank and Gaza is not an ideological imperative, but responds to security considerations.
For them, Jewish settlements in the territories are not a return to historical lands, but represent security strongholds to prevent (or to push for a more strategic location) a heart attack Israel.
This assessment of the situation may be right or wrong, but it certainly is not ideological.
Ariel Sharon, who comes from a military background (he grew up in a social environment in which ideas were more akin to the Labour Party as those of Jabotinsky) is a strategic hawk.
For ideological hawks, compromises are treason: how to jeopardize the historical patrimony of the Jewish people, let alone God's promise to Abraham?
Strategic hawks, however, are open to negotiations and practical compromises, if circumstances are favorable and if the security considerations justify it in their eyes.
It is in this context that must be considered the actions of Sharon.
He was elected on the promise that he would bring peace and security.
He has brought neither one nor the other.
With the defeat and demise of Saddam Hussein, the danger of an "Eastern front" against Israel has weakened.
No Palestinian partner, and because of the ongoing Palestinian terrorism fierce Israeli actions fail to suppress the actions of Sharon flow from this strategy oriented thinking: build an effective barrier, move some of the isolated settlements and strategically untenable, and wait.
Sharon's statements in the previous year seem to follow a well-defined model.
First, he admitted "that one day or another," a Palestinian state would make its appearance, an inconceivable idea for pure ideological hawks.
A few months later, he scandalized his followers at the conference of the Likud party, declaring that the occupation was unacceptable and untenable, another shock for those who always talked about "liberated" territories rather than "occupied" territories.
Last December, he explicitly stated that Israel had turned to a cease - - unilateral ceasefire that would inevitably lead to the "relocation" of some settlements.
Although these statements were similar again to a simple verbiage, they have nevertheless created a new language for a Likud prime minister.
The latest statements of Sharon nevertheless explicitly named the settlements to be evacuated; Director of the National Security Council, Giora Eiland General, was appointed chairman of an inter relocation committee to develop plans to evacuate settlements and to provide compensation for relocated settlers.
All this has radically altered the internal political map of Israel.
Some ideological hawks in Sharon's government threatened to resign; Shimon Peres announced that Labour would give Sharon a parliamentary safety net; it is also talk that the Labor Party to join a national unity government.
The test is obviously not the planning, but the implementation of withdrawal, and the road is long and bumpy.
Timing Sharon may have been guided by his problems with police investigations after its alleged corruption.
However, anyone wishing to predict the future behavior of Sharon must keep in mind that unlike Begin and Shamir, Sharon has a military background and that for him, security, not ideology, comes first .
His apparent pragmatism should thus come as no surprise.
Iraq: The victor's justice.
Saddam Hussein is dead, but all Iraqis do not rejoice.
Instead, the way the different ethnic and religious groups have responded to his execution is emblematic of the difficulty of maintaining the cohesion of Iraq.
To the Shiite majority, long violently oppressed by Saddam Hussein and all previous Iraqi Sunni regimes, Saddam's death symbolizes their attainment of political hegemony.
Moreover, their triumphalist jubilation are a cruel reminder of how the oppressed, once released, can so easily become oppressors in their turn.
To the Sunni minority, pushed from power by the US invasion and expresses his frustration with daily attacks against the Shiite population and its holy sites, Saddam will remain a hero for a long time.
The Kurds - who, like the Shiites have suffered the atrocities of Saddam for decades - quietly cling to their de facto independence, while doing what it takes to ensure that they will never be subjected Arab rule.
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki, representing the Shiite and Kurdish coalition, expressed his hope that the execution of the dictator will overcome sectarian divisions.
But even if his words seem sincere, reality leads to the opposite direction, and the ugly verbal exchanges at the same performance certainly does not help to forget that it was the victor's justice - not states - the US, but the Shiites.
These events do not bode well for the future of what we should get used to name "the former - Iraq."
Indeed, the current debate in Washington on stabilizing Iraq moved because we can not stabilize something that no longer exists - in this case, Iraq as a sovereign state.
Under the guise of constitutional amendments inspired by the states - the US, the Shiite majority has come to wield almost absolute power.
Thus what appeared to be Washington, there a few months, a successful transition to a representative government is only a farce as under Saddam, authority depends on gun control. The difference today is that the government no longer has the monopoly of violence.
Every militia, every ministry, every Shia political faction has its own arms, his big arms and death squads. In turn, the Sunnis continue to use the stockpiles of weapons accumulated under Saddam to lead a rearguard action - warning against the new order, apparently legitimized by elections.
With the exception of a new violent dictatorship, no authority is able to bring together Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds in a single political entity.
The pipe dream of the US administration - democratizing overnight a deeply divided society and accustomed to violence and coercion - released a terrifying trail of political demons.
In these circumstances, the subsequent debate over Baker - Hamilton in Washington has little impact on the future of Iraq, although it remains essential to the future of power, prestige and status of States - States itself in the world.
The future of Iraq will be decided by the Iraqis, but with bullets, not ballots.
The United - States and the entire international community are totally unprepared to face the average release - East of Yugoslavia and its regional consequences.
And unlike the states of the breakup of Yugoslavia, which could look to Europe, the lack of a legitimate Arab democratic model makes even more difficult the establishment of a democratic order.
Some Europeans and others may gloat over the failure of the United - States in Iraq, and the ineptness - or worse - following their desperate political occupation.
Yet the underlying reasons for this failure goes back much further, to the creation of all parts of Iraq in the 20's by British imperialist planners, who gathered together three disparate provinces of the defeated Ottoman Empire into a state that does has never been a coherent identity.
Thus the foundation of Iraq based on victors' justice: the British Empire after defeating the Ottomans gave power to Sunni Arabs in a country where they were a minority.
Today, this arrangement falls apart after a new round of victor's justice.
The consequences of this reorganization of power are not yet clear.
But it is certain that a coherent Iraqi state, it is unified, federal or confederal, can emerge from a society which part rightly considers Saddam as a murderous dictator, and another part reveres him as hero and martyr.
Wars always have unintended consequences and cruel ironies.
In Iraq, it is now apparent that some states can not be saved without being destroyed.
The Battle of the European Union for Turkey.
When the conspirators behind suicide attacks in Istanbul launched their human bombs against synagogues and British office buildings, they had different audiences in mind.
Citizens of the European Union that the Turkish political class is eager to join as soon represent one of the public, possibly the most important.
The battle within the European Union about the entry of Turkey will take place on many fronts: within the country - even where the government is undertaking major reforms to qualify for membership of the European Union at the negotiating table once the European Council in December 2004 authorizes the Commission to open formal negotiations for accession to the European Union and in the public in the existing members.
Of these three fronts, the latter is the most demanding.
Most citizens of the European Union are uneasy today the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãTurkish membership in the EU.
Those responsible for atrocities in Istanbul may - be calculated that Islamist terrorism can do to increase the discomfort.
Traditionally, European citizens have always accepted the new members hurrying to the front door to join the club as he passed the group of six countries of origin to the 25 countries that bring together within the Union European in 2004.
Formerly purely Western community, the Union has pushed its boundaries in all directions.
Starting next year, it will spread to the north of Finland to Cyprus and Malta in the south, to the west of Ireland to the Baltic States in the East.
While the constituent peoples have often worried that newcomers take their jobs and subsidies, they always come to accept.
But the case of Turkey is different.
The 10 new countries joining the EU next year, and even the Balkan countries that now are offered the possibility of future membership, are all found within a traditional definition of Europe.
None of them is big enough to worry the EU's current balance.
None of this is only in the case of Turkey.
Apart from a narrow strip of land, its territory lies in Asia, not in Europe, its culture is Islamic, not Christian, and if it were to join the Union in 2013, for example, its population will be far the largest and youngest of all EU member countries.
In addition, due to the Turkish borders with countries such as Iran, Iraq and Syria, Turkey would bring to the EU a disturbing neighborhood: a part of the world incapable of developing a regional peace on its own , a front - fundamentalism station and the Islamist terrorism, an assembly of fragile states imbued with nationalism, a field of confrontation for militarization, even nuclear, a region where states - States remain strategically involved and where Israel will always be the concentration point sentiments anti - Western.
Turkey entering the European Union, the EU will become involved in a Middle - Eastern expanded restless and disturbing, the most provocative part of the world today.
Yet it is precisely because of these implications that the advantages are the arrival of Turkey into the EU by far exceed the risks involved.
Above all, the possibility of a future accession to the Union is the most powerful force for modernization of Turkey, Turkey and a modern, democratic and prosperous Europe is essential, whether inside or outside the EU.
In addition, to enter the EU a type of moderate Islam in Turkey like this will be critical to the integration of Muslim minorities in European countries, already large and growing even without the support of the population of Turkey .
Finally, with the possibilities brought by Turkey with its Islamic traditions, regional contacts, resources and geography, the EU will be in a better position to exert a stabilizing influence on a region that will inevitably affect the security of Europe.
These are powerful arguments.
The big question is whether they are powerful enough to influence the skeptical European public.
It would only take one of the 30 countries members of the EU can represent - being in 2013 to prevent the accession of Turkey.
Some, no doubt, want to give voice to their people through a referendum that will leave the decision to the people, not just in parliament.
Even in Germany, where the constitution does not allow referendums, we called the referendum in the case of the entry of Turkey and the opposition party has already announced that it will make it a central issue of the campaign next year for elections to the European Parliament.
Once public unease towards Turkey can find focus point on the referendum for the possible entry of the country into the EU, there will be little chance he could enter.
At the end of negotiations, it may appear - be that Turkey is ready for Europe, but Europe is not yet ready for Turkey.
That is why the battle for the entry of Turkey has already begun and that the terrorist Istanbul seem to have understood.
Those who think that the EU will be beneficial for Turkey as well as for Europe must also engage in the battle to defend their ideas.
There would be nothing worse for Turkey and for Europe, as European governments prepared to welcome Turkey and failing to convince their populations.
Terrorists will no doubt continue to stoke the fears of the timid European to an Islamist Turkey.
Hopefully in the end, the attacks against innocent people crowded streets of Istanbul do not feed the fears of Europeans, but rather a sense of solidarity with this dynamic and moderate country, facing a common enemy.
The high fences make bad neighbors in Europe.
Good fences make good neighbors, in the words of the poet Robert Frost.
Unfortunately, the EU seems to be taking Frost's poetic fancy as an important political order.
Indeed, how the European Union is preparing to welcome the citizens of the ten countries that will join in May?
Simply slamming the door in their face and installing protection legislation to force them to stay outside first.
In fact, the EU is even worse.
Since there is no European-level agreement on regulations to implement the new EU citizens, each member country sets its own rules without any coordination.
Some of these being created regulations are draconian.
Austria and Germany - so far the two largest recipients of immigration from Eastern Europe, welcoming four fifth - announced last year that they would restrict immigration from the new Member States for the duration of the transition period, seven years.
France and Belgium will restrict immigration of new citizens of the European Union during the first two years of the minimum period of transition.
Sweden seemed to have adopted a liberal position at first, but now postponed the opening of its borders and could reduce immigrants' access to welfare benefits.
The Danish government almost collapsed in January when the Ministry of Labor proposed to open the job market to all new EU citizens who can prove that they have found employment.
Greece and Italy have been silent so far, which probably means they will retain the current restrictions vis - a - vis the new Member States will be de facto treated the same as any non-EU immigrant .
Thus, all the countries bordering the new member states will be closed to migration from the "New Europe".
All these dams reflect the growing general concern to the citizens of the new member states emigrating to take advantage of generous welfare systems in the Union.
No wonder, then, that the most spectacular waterfalls of popular support for enlargement registered by European surveys have occurred in EU countries benefiting from social welfare services the most generous.
But support for enlargement is weakening across the threshold of the entry of new countries.
At the same time, close the door of the Union on its newest citizens will not solve the problem of access to social services and certainly will hurt economic growth.
The labor markets of the European Union which are characterized by low mobility, such as those that exist in Western Europe or Southern Europe, migrants can play a very important role.
By increasing average productivity, they contribute not only to increasing growth but also to achieve higher per capita income.
In fact, due to distortions in the definition of wages fixed-often with no real connection with the labor productivity rate locally migrant workers even contribute to reducing unemployment in Western and Southern Europe.
In addition, close the door will not solve the issue of access to social assistance because illegal immigration is a threat worse than legal migration: it exploits the resources without contributing anything in return for welfare even if the Most of the immigrants are young and work.
The best way to deal with the fear of immigration as a source of abuse to the social systems would be to adopt common transitional quotas and quite generous in the EU as a whole, then delete them if they quickly are not met.
Migration quotas are preferable to any other type of restriction because they allow at least some of the potential gains in welfare from immigrant is realized.
Quotas could be determined according to the historical periods of high immigration - depending, for example, an annual flow of 400,000 people for the entire European Union.
While these transitional restrictions are put in place, reforms should be undertaken to answer the questions below - public fears tend to immigration.
The root of this fear, of course, lies in the vast differences in income between citizens of Lithuania, for example, and those of most countries of the Union.
Of course, economic convergence is a long-term deal.
Thus, redistributive policies of the European Union should be reformed to discourage citizens of the poorest member countries from making welfare emplette.
Here the problem is the inconsistency of social insurance on the one hand, as the aid that we receive are based on contributions and on the other hand, social assistance programs that involve cash transfers.
All countries of the European Union and new members should be encouraged to adapt their social assistance programs (which are also present in the new member countries), so they all meet certain basic requirements.
Coordination of these minimum guaranteed income throughout the European Union has gradually set up with the intention, in the long term to establish a valuable safety net throughout the European Union and forming a its institutional pillars.
Calder√≥n's challenges.
Mexico has finally found a new president last Friday, in circumstances not bode well.
Felipe Calder√≥n was sworn in, braving the wrath of his left-wing opposition, and showing smarter than the Partido de la Revoluci√≥n Democr√°tica (PRD) and its leader, Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, but without avoiding to pay a high price .
All TV news broadcasts and some from around the world displayed the same securities, "the new Mexican president came to power in chaos and violence."
Mexican institutions have resisted narrowly attacks a virtually insurrectional left-wing opposition, which was bent in vain to prevent the inauguration of Calder√≥n, and the bitterness of a Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI), more more determined to let Calder√≥n take power before failing miserably.
If Calder√≥n impressively overcame seemingly insurmountable obstacles on the path to the presidency, the struggle to govern and transform Mexico has just begun yet.
Most Mexican journalists believe that it should be relatively easy for Calder√≥n to improve on what was largely self Failure - inflicted outgoing President Vicente Fox.
Mexico needs to grow about twice as fast as it had under Fox (a small 2% per year).
If Calder√≥n can strengthen law and order, and use his considerable political skills to reach agreement with the PRI on structural economic reforms, he will succeed.
But this is a simplistic view.
The mandate of Fox, and the last four years from that of President Ernesto Zedillo, have not really been a failure.
Mexico had not experienced economic stability, low inflation, low interest rates, a stable currency and constant growth, although poor ten years in a row since the 1960s.
For the first time ever, mortgages, auto loans and consumer credit became available to the lower strata of the middle class: this year, it has built and sold more houses and bought more cars than ever before.
Similarly, although we can blame Fox for not silence the protesters and an extremist and disruptive opposition, he never resorted to the bloody repression that has made famous most of his predecessors.
In addition, he tore his archaic Mexico cocoon in terms of foreign affairs and placed immigration and human rights at the heart of the new Mexican international program.
Calder√≥n does not find that negotiate with the PRI is an easy task, and it fails to develop a coalition government, he believes to be the solution to the impasse in Mexico gets stuck since 1997.
Whatever the advantages of a cabinet comprising solely members of his Partido Acci√≥n Nacional (PAN), this is not what Calder√≥n sought.
Similarly, it proved impossible to reach any agreement with the opposition in regard to the inauguration ceremony, where the chaotic scenes as depressing as members of Congress about to fight in the room while Calder√≥n passed quickly through a back door to a ceremony shipped in a hurry.
The economic problems of Mexico might be too much more intractable than many seem to think journalists.
Mexico has experienced a brutal economic opening under former President Carlos Salinas in 1988 - 1994, a political opening delayed but successful under President Zedillo in 1994 - 2000, and finally to a real rotation of power thanks to Fox.
But the foundations of the old PRI system - corporatist created in the 1930s are still intact and are the most impressive and the most formidable obstacles to the growth and success of Mexico.
The first pillar of this system consists of public and private economic monopolies that dominate the country.
The oil company (Pemex) and electric (Comisi√≥n Federal de Elecricidad) managed by the state have no competitors.
Private monopolies in telecommunications (Telmex), television (Televisa), cement (Cemex), the production of bread and tortilla (Bimbo and Maseca, respectively) and banking (Banamex / Citigroup and Bancomer / Banco de Bilbao) may - be face competition abroad, but not at the national level.
These monopolies are stronger than ever, and these are the prices, supplies, service and quality suffer.
The second pillar is formed by the unions that control movement of Mexican workers since the 1930s.
They enjoy privileges hiring and firing workers non - union members, elect officers by acclamation benefit from mandatory contributions without transparency and immense political power.
The teachers 'union is the largest in Latin America, the oil workers' union is the richest and that of the Social Security employees thwarts any attempt at pension reform or health for years.
The third pillar of the system is political monopoly.
For 70 years, the PRI has completely controlled Mexican politics; today there are three parties to do so, and no one else can enter the political arena or have access to the enormous public subsidies - more than $ 500 million last year - without their consent.
The main parties write their own anti - trust legislation, vote their own subsidies, and choose their own elected officials.
The absence of consecutive re-election at any level it strengthens the power of the party machine: they pick candidates, voters merely ratify at the polls.
The challenges of Mexico thus reduce to liberalize the movement of workers, break the private monopolies and opening the public monopolies to competition, and lowering entry barriers that restrict access to the political arena.
It may - be sufficient conditions for success, but they are certainly necessary.
Calder√≥n must strengthen his presidency from the outset.
Take ownership of power may - be the only way to get there, even though it may seem risky.
Elected with only 35% of the vote, without a majority in Congress, and with a takeover on the eve of an economic slowdown in the States - the United States, things are tough all ways.
Given that roughly a third of the electorate think wrongly gained, and given the precariousness of the rule of law in the country, Calder√≥n's position is even less enviable.
Prudence and patience would not anyway probably not his best advisors.
Challenge Ch√°vez.
The recent parliamentary elections held in Venezuela confirmed the trend that has placed the country in the headlines of all the newspapers in recent years.
President Hugo Ch√°vez has demonstrated once again that he enjoys broad support among the poor and desperate people of the country and has a good measure ahead of his opposition in terms of political skills, d skill and ruthlessness.
Yet at the same time there has been a decline in attendance at the ballot box as each new election organized under the mandate of Mr Ch√°vez and the questionable fairness of elections is becoming increasingly visible.
It is certain that the withdrawal of the opposition a few days before the election represented rather as Ch√°vez claimed, a symptom of its own weakness than of problems with the electoral process.
And it is almost certain that this very weakness is part of the gradual stifling of many features of Venezuela's traditional democratic.
Even so, the errors of the opposition were very high, ranging from support for the failed coup against Ch√°vez democratically elected in April 2002 attacks against PEDEVSA without result, the national oil company of Venezuela, at the beginning 2003.
Nothing is more dangerous in politics than failure in direct confrontation.
In such circumstances, Ch√°vez can afford to be bold, despite his political failures when it comes to act in favor of his electoral base: 50% or more of Venezuelans who live in poverty and despair .
Poverty has grown since Ch√°vez came to power in 1998 the state budget and trade balances are even more oil revenues to thank you today that this was the case in the past, and, apart from Cuban literacy programs and neighborhood services of "barefoot doctors" the entire public health of poor people has stagnated, if not worse.
It is likely that the future will not bring any major change.
Ch√°vez may modify much of the constitution at will, and pack his men in the judiciary and electoral authorities.
It will continue to distribute grants thanks to oil revenues in the well-worn tradition of Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez and Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez.
Therefore, Ch√°vez will be elected again next year and could stay in power until the end of the next decade.
Yet if this is what the Venezuelan people want, so be it.
It is, after all, their responsibility as deciding who will govern them, and how, as long as human rights are not systematically violated, democratic institutions indefinitely suspended, and international business conduct standards are met .
According to the latter, at least, Ch√°vez may - be gone further than permitted.
For years, he was accused of taking over where Fidel Castro by supporting radical rhetoric and anti - imperialism, if not revolution, throughout Latin America.
It might - be now time for the nations of Latin America and the international community to take these allegations seriously.
Ch√°vez is giving away oil to Caribbean island nations and Cuba, and buying off Argentine debt to help President Nestor Kirchner politics.
In Mar del Plata, Argentina, last month, he openly participated in a rally against the Free Trade Area - Trade of the Americas (FTAA), accompanied, among others, Evo Morales, the Bolivian leader planters leaves coca, which could become the next president of Bolivia.
Similarly, Ch√°vez is clearly supporting Daniel Ortega, the perennial Sandinista candidate in the Nicaraguan presidential elections and Shafick Handal, the equally perennial FMLN candidate in El Salvador.
His former ambassador to Mexico participated openly and vociferously in presidential election evenings mayor of Mexico City, Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador.
It seems that the foreign policy of Ch√°vez one main theme: to provoke a major confrontation with the states - united.
The danger is, of course, that when this confrontation occurs, if it occurs, either on Bolivia, the FTAA, human rights or freedom of the press, will be too late to control it.
The challenge is to prevent the confrontation that Ch√°vez clearly wants.
Unfortunately, the Bush administration has never proved particularly adept at conflict prevention.
The other nations of the hemisphere have a direct interest in preventing a fight that would force them to take sides and might threaten their economic and national security interests.
Although many of Ch√°vez's positions have received some support from some Latin American nations, the division he created in Latin America, with the help and Castro's Cuba, between the right and the left, between the advocates of free trade and "Bolivarians" between pro and anti - American, is essentially artificial and certainly not impossible to overcome.
Sure, many Latin American leaders have tried to assuage and control Ch√°vez, without result.
It could cost us dearly not to try.
The last time revolutionary opposed to states - united in Central America in the 1980s, everyone lost it.
New divisions in the hemisphere, engineered by a leader awash in oil money, would prove far more disastrous.
Must - we reaffirm the positive discrimination?
The equal rights of all citizens is a fundamental principle of the liberal order.
Such rights offer opportunities to participate in political life, to form associations and express themselves freely.
Ausis they open the door to economic participation and participation in social institutions such as education.
The constitutional guarantee of these rights are a spectacular success in the long battle for citizenship that marked the two centuries that have gone by.
However, such legal guarantees of rights are often insufficient.
And even the right to vote has little meaning for someone who is totally dependent on other institutions and others.
Equality before the law remains an empty pormesse for those who can not afford to use it or who simply do not know how to use.
The civil right to an education commensurate with the intellectual capacity of each should be encouraged in many ways.
Thus, a major theme of social progress in the last century still give life to the abstract concept of equal rights by creating a social content.
This involved actively encourage such actions through information and political education, for example.
Regarding the world of education, this often meant committing resources in terms of financial aid destinations for students in the form of subsidized loans or scholarships.
Yet, despite these achievements, some stubborn obstacles still opposed the equal participation of all.
Large groups of the population remained under - represented in social circles distinguished citizens.
This was the case especially women and some cultural minorities, especially in cases where these minorities were under allocation characteristics not covered by a choice such as skin color.
Few leaders, ministers, teachers, doctors or lawyers were in the populations of these groups, and feeding them questions about the invisible barriers that prevented minorities access to such positions.
Proponents of entrenched institutional cultures can have - being campaigned against women or blacks.
Wanting to full citizenship for all involved realize the need more than legal guarantees, dissemination of information and even financial aid offered.
It was a courageous step, carried out by the United - States in the lead, only to decide for a time at least that new policies were needed to address these injustices installed a long time. The affirmative action or positive discrimination as it was called, was to establish a set of regulations which reserved a percentage of representation among political candidates, students and teachers, the police and the armed forces and any other group, for persons belonging to these disadvantaged minorities.
The Supreme Court of the United - States became the guardian of affirmative action.
Wherever it was seriously establishment, affirmative action was undoubtedly a success.
This is particularly the case in countries that once had a homogeneous population and must now take into account the black citizens or Muslim or identifiable as belonging to an identifiable and neglected minority.
And, that's just when other countries turned to the States - United to draw from a political model that political discrimination was challenged through three essential questions.
First, it does not incur the risk of injustice reversed which traditionally favored classes find themselves destitute?
The Supreme Court of the United - States had to answer this question when elel treated for the first time in the case of a white student who had been denied admission to medical school despite its superior academic results with those other candidates.
Great - Britain, children in private schools must we now cover feared to be in a disadvantaged position because of the pressure on universities to admit more students from public schools.
This brings us to the unpleasant stale and whether we can be equal as much than excellent?
Then the equal representation at all levels is - it really what everyone is calling and what we all need Vons?
After all, the "feminization" of the teaching m√©tieurs in many countries had no negative effect.
Many countries have benefited from the entrepreneurial spirit of their Chinese or Jewish minorities.
Are - not us too mechanical pursuit of ideals where the absence of privileges and obstacles are confused with the lack of diversity?
Finally, positive discrimination in some cases produces - it not a new form of rigid segmentation that destroys genuine civil society it seeks to put in place?
Women, for example, are - they are still the best lawyers for women's advocacy?
The same question applies to members of religious groups and ethnic minorities, and even of certain social classes.
One shudders at the thought of parliaments where the main criterion for admission would be part of a group in need of representation through affirmative action.
Indeed, in some countries, democracy fails to implement an imaginative and effective governance because the main objective seems to be to take into account all relevant groups.
To use an idea developed above - the posititve discrimination has always been and still is a last step brave decisive in the struggle for universal civil rights, not only on paper but in everyday reality.
However, affirmative action must not become an enduring principle of a liberal order.
If there is a set of legal provisions that needs a "sunset clause" to set up the study of the results produced after a specific period of limited application, it is indeed positive discrimination .
The flexibility of the Supreme Court of the United - States in this field is exemplary.
Moreover, it is probably best to introduce into local legislation an expiry clause for affirmative action after a period of five or ten years at most.
Such a clause could be renewed but there is nothing more effective than a firm deadline to force a careful examination and concentration of thought.
The State - revisited nation.
It is now fashionable to claim that the nation - state has lost its place.
Globalization, says - it means that nations can no longer control their own affairs.
They must join with others, as in the case of the European Union, ASEAN or Mercosur, and increasingly rely with international institutions like the United Nations, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization .
Such a view is risky.
Besides, when you look more closely, it turns out the suspect, or simply wrong.
The nation - state, with its strengths and weaknesses, is alive and is thriving.
To begin with its strengths, the nation - state remains the only political space that succeed in the constitution of liberty.
The democratic credentials of organizations like the EU are doubtful, and entirely absent in the UN and other global institutions Nations.
Moreover, despite the frequent search for new identities, European, Latin - American or otherwise, and despite many references to a new cosmopolitanism, or even a "world civil society," most people feel at home in their own countries, nation - state which they are citizens.
Migration is generally migration to other countries.
Many countries are currently debating the integration of migrants.
What should - it to be British or German or American?
Such debates about immigration make sense only if we recognize that citizenship is defined by and for nations.
That is, for most people, the positive side of the nation - state.
The nation - state has been for more than two centuries and continues to be the unit of belonging and civic involvement for most human beings.
This is the context in which we find our liberties safeguarded or destroyed.
Countries freed from communism in 1989 felt that restoring national sovereignty and recovering liberty were bound together.
There are, however, and there has always been, another, uglier, state - nation is nationalism.
The nationalist impulse can be aggressive or defensive, directed against others or facing inwards.
In both cases, it vitiates all attempts to create an international community of open societies.
That was the problem in Iraq: a nation - state had become a troublemaker in the region and - beyond.
More recently, a less violent but equally worrying phenomenon has gained ground, the revival of national protectionism.
The Doha round of trade negotiations is stalled because developed countries refuse to open their markets to cheaper products from developing countries, which in turn try to protect their infant industries.
Many would prefer privileged relationships to open trade.
In this area, the EU has often obliged.
But now the nationalist bug has infected the EU.
France, Spain and Poland firmly tried to keep major industries in "national hands."
Suddenly, the single European market is forgotten, and a return to fragmented markets is taking root.
Consider, for example, the "services directive" from the European Commission.
Although the free movement of workers is one of the "four freedoms" of the single market, many EU countries are trying to protect their domestic labor markets by suspending this freedom for as long as possible.
Germany, in particular, argues that the high unemployment resulting from reunification in 1990 requires it to close its labor market to the new states - members of the East.
Such trends are dangerous.
Historically, protectionism has often led to economic conflict, which can rapidly turn into more serious conflicts.
The signs are not good, even in Europe.
A recent EU leaders summit had addressed energy policy - one area where cooperation is not only highly desirable, but necessary.
Yet even German Chancellor Angela Merkel, clearly pro - European, went to this meeting with the explicit intention of halting the creation of other European powers in this area.
The German agreement - Russian construction of a gas pipeline bypassing Poland and Lithuania, with former Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der leading the effort, has already harmed relations between Poland and Germany, not to mention the European cooperation.
For a time, the pendulum of public opinion may have swung too far from the nation - state and its role.
This is one reason why so many people have felt estranged from their political leaders.
But it would be unfortunate, and even dangerous, the pendulum back towards nationalism in the former.
Nation - states are welcome; they are important elements of a liberal world order.
But they must be open to cooperation and coordination with others.
We must ensure resisting the start of a trend reminiscent of developments in the early years of the twentieth century, a trend that quickly led to global disaster.
Gordon Brown - it eligible?
Obviously, Gordon Brown wants to succeed Tony Blair as British prime minister.
Yet it is less clear that it is ready to do everything necessary to lead the Labour Party to victory in the next election.
Indeed, it must absolutely renounce Blair's legacy, which, at a minimum, means promising to leave the Great - Britain in the Iraq war.
Brown covets the office of Prime Minister since May 12, 1994, the fateful day when John Smith, the leader of the Labour Party was in opposition, died of a heart attack.
Two weeks later, on May 31, Blair and Brown met in a small restaurant in North London, and debated the personality that should take over the party leadership.
At the end of their discussion, they concluded a double deal: Brown would remain aloof and would support Blair, who pledged in return to give him the place later.
The fact that they are not only agreed on the timing or circumstances of the transfer of power was as inevitable as decisive.
They could obviously not foresee that Blair would win three successive election victories in 1997, 2001 and 2005, is unprecedented for their party, and thus keep Labour in power for an unparalleled period that was likely to last 13 years.
The challenge - key for New Labour (as Blair's makeover has used his characteristic gift for manipulation) was the British economy management.
Since World War II, most British governments tried to manipulate the economy to promote their short-term advantage, usually collecting long-term disastrous results.
This lamentable tradition was common to the Conservatives and Labour, yet, as unfair as it may seem, it is Labour that was most marred by an inability reputation for economic management.
Brown changed that reputation decisively.
It was probably the Minister of Economy the most remarkable in British history, which is not put on the account of the inspiration or genius, but simply on the fact that it has established a new tradition giving priority to moderate inflation, low interest rates and stable government finances.
Brown understood that these priorities were essential, not just for the British economy, but also for the long-term objectives of Labour in power; and it has promoted the program by giving the Bank of England independent responsibility for keeping inflation low.
The result was that Great - Britain has had an unprecedented decade, marked by low inflation and relatively high economic growth, surpassing in this area many of its European counterparts.
Yet, despite economic success, it became increasingly clear that Blair was over.
Voters gradually disillusioned before the inevitable flaws of too familiar government, and the party has proved increasingly dissatisfied with one count who abused his hospitality.
At first, Blair thought that he could claim the right to remain in power time for a third term of five years.
But the pressure he endured from which has steadily increased to the point that virtually promised to go in summer 2007.
No one knows exactly when, or how Blair will give way.
If a formal competition for the party leadership is organized, it seems likely that many candidates will in the running.
That said, virtually every observer authoritative on the subject seem to agree to designate Brown as by far the most likely to become the next Labour prime minister.
So much for the easy side.
From there, no one seems to know that Brown knows what to do or have the ability to fight and win another general election for Labour.
His reputation management and control of the economy is also masterful qu'incontest√©e, but he gave almost no indication of what he thinks of other government policies.
It remained cold and almost silent, visibly anxious to get his inheritance, but gave absolutely no clue what would change if he did.
If there is one thing he can not promise is to continue the Blair policy.
If Brown chooses continuity, he will lose.
After ten years of Blair, he must offer one or more policies that mark a clear divide.
The choice of the most obvious change in policy regarding Iraq: if Brown wants to win an election as Labour leader, he must renounce Blair's policy and announce the rapid withdrawal of British troops.
In tactical terms, this should be easier than obvious: whatever the false and illegal reasons originally given as a pretext for invading Iraq, everyone now knows that this war was a political disaster, Strategic and moral.
Everyone knows that it can not be "won", that is if it means something, and Brown knows that both the war and the servile submission of Great - Britain the Bush administration are deeply unpopular in the country.
This is the problem that it is most urgent to be addressed: but so far, none of the main political parties has dared touch it.
Over the past three weeks, Labour, Liberal - Democrats and Conservatives have all held their annual conference.
All focused on national policies, none dared broach the subject of Iraq, because they all know that it would raise the question of withdrawal, which in turn would cause a major and possibly explosive debate on the relationship between Great - Britain and the United States - United.
Brown will be bold enough to confront the issue of Iraq?
Probably not.
It may very well decide that this is too difficult, in which case it will be an interim prime minister, condemned to lead the last three mandate Labor no hope of winning the next election.
This is certainly not what he had planned through its market with Blair in 1994.
The Hot New Economics.
Great Depression propelled John Maynard Keynes on the center stage of economic thought.
According to Keynes, private investment is inherently unstable because of fashions and fads among investors due to changes in the "animal spirits" of businessmen, or because falling prices disrupts the system Economic.
Keynesians believed that prudent monetary policies (central banks raising or lowering interest rates to diminish fluctuations in private investment) could participate in the stabilization of the economy.
But they also believed that government had to agree to be directly involved with generous tax policies, to maintain the overall level of spending in a stable economy.
Such a policy, thought - they, forever banish the specter of large-scale mass unemployment, as was the case during the Great Depression.
In addition, it could also possibly guarantee full employment effectively.
They foresaw that near-full employment would increase the threat of inflation.
After all, why the workers and unions should - they moderate their wage demands if governments support expenses whenever the threat of unemployment rumbles?
An important limitation of the requirements for high wages (fear of being fired when unemployment will rise) and was blown.
What - what could replace it?
For the first generation of post - war, the predominant response was holding the head - corporatist democracy would replace it.
Unions are bent with government requirements to moderate their own salary increase requirements and governments would comply with the requirements of unions in public spending and social benefits.
Keynesian thinking assures us that the Great Depression never can happen again.
Yet his solution to rampant inflation problem was not the road and completely collapsed in the 1970s.
Following the first inflationary crisis of the 1970s in the major industrialized countries, the dominant economic thinking in these countries turned to the tracks "semi - monetarist".
Milton Friedman's victory was never as complete as was that of the Keynesians.
However, in the mid-1980s, politicians from around the world agreed on the following:.
Central banks should credibly commit to stability in the long term.
Central banks must accept that the average unemployment rate is determined not by "cyclical" factors, but by structural factors that they should not try to solve.
Advertise and try to maintain a monetary growth target is an easy way for the central bank to communicate its principal intentions, gain credibility and give outsiders a way to check if sound policies are followed.
Monetarism was only the inverted image of Keynesianism.
It seemed to ensure that the inflation of the 1970s could never reproduce.
But it offered no solution to the problem of structural unemployment that arose in western Europe.
The last fifteen years have demonstrated that monetarism is ill equipped to handle the challenges of falling prices in the context of business and highly leveraged banks as the Keynesian solution was not made to handle the challenges of inflation .
In the 1970s and 1980s, some, including me - well, put the failure of social systems - Democrats to control inflation on the account of bad decisions.
Politicians did not understand that the increase in social benefits was the price to pay for the inevitable reduction in wages, while union leaders did not understand that if the social - democratic corporatist not limited inflation, political power would pass to the right and rising unemployment would be used to limit it.
Today, we still puts on other bad decisions reflect current alarming economic conditions in the heart of the industrialized world (more than a decade of stagnation in Japan, accompanied by deflation, deflation also present in Germany, accompanied by recession) .
The European and Japanese central banks have not lowered their interest rates sufficiently and soon enough: banking sector regulators have turned away mood swings of speculative lending and politicians have refused to extend fiscal policies sufficiently.
But politicians and central bank governors can not always be considered capable of making good decisions. Good policies must be designed to operate despite the lack of vision and good advice of leaders.
Inflation 70s was just a normal failure of Keynesian political economy.
Deflation that threatens Japan, Europe and can - even states - States of a long period of irr√©conciliation between potential and actual output is a natural failure of the semi orthodoxy - that dominated the monetarist macroeconomic policies at the heart of the industrialized world since the early 1980s.
We turn in circles.
Without a circle: no government would allow the repetition of the collapse of liquidity as happened in the 1930s or bankruptcy of banks and companies on a clean scale to the whole economic system at risk .
It's an upward spiral.
Macroeconomic problems of the world are real but will not lead to another Great Depression, largely because politicians remember that first Great Depression.
We need a new revolution of economic policies in the Keynesian mode and semi - monetarist, a revolution that will not lose (fully) view the achievements of previous revolutions but eliminate their intrinsic defects.
Where could come this revolution?
May - be good to Ben Bernanke, the new governor of the Federal Reserve, whose long career has always been concerned in asset prices, the role of adverse selection in the credit market and the need of central banks in difficult circumstances not to be limited to short-term common operations on open markets.
He firmly believes that banks should try to pave the way for long-term investments in action.
Bernank√©isme have - you say?
The Fate of Humanity / Hopes of humanity.
For some time now, and certainly since the terrorist attacks against the United - States on 11 September 2001, as in the past when we witnessed the massacres in Kosovo, Sarajevo, Srebrenica, Rwanda and Congo on our televisions, the news speak louder than war or threat of war, violent deaths or threats of violent deaths.
Around the world, we are all highly lucid about the power of our arms.
Nuclear-tipped missiles down to trucks full of fertilizer or explosives worn on the belt, we used our technological capacity to greatly expand the dark side of our biological species violent nature of the role of wrongdoing predator.
I certainly do not intend to downplay or dismiss this aspect of the history of humanity or current events.
I do not want to forget that more than half of the previous century has passed for some killing shot, gassed, stabbing, burning or starve tenth of living men on this planet, whether due to First World War and famine that followed the Great Leap Forward Mao.
However, it is not this is a complete inventory.
In fact, the human abattoirs of the twentieth century - and the slaughterhouses that prepare various communities as of today - may not appear in the future as the most important part of our experience and our human condition, nor what our descendants will regard as their history.
For them, the most important features of our experience can be - being.

Overall, the twentieth century was witness to many of the world remained desperately poor due to several reasons: (1) a criminal governance; (2) a lack of useful and productive machines in a global economy, out of subsistence agriculture and service industry sub - qualified; (3) a public education system does not exist, which could provide citizens education and know - how necessary for the use of these machines; (4) barriers (legal and physical) that kept people where demand is low, sell the products of their work where demand is high.
However, towards the end of the twentieth century, these four reasons for indigence were generally reduced.
Governments such as that of Kim Jong Il in North Korea are very rare nowadays.
Almost all countries of the world are just one generation of the almost universal literacy.
Rapid technological progress has created a cornucopia of invention and innovation open to all regions that can send a student get an engineering degree.
Above all, the customs barriers that goods produced in Mauritius, Mozambique and Mauritania are sold in New York or Berlin or Tokyo and Santiago fall quickly.
The huge cargo ships on the seas appeared recently revolutionized global trade in a generation.
New information technologies used in the management of transport routes and distribution will likely have the same impact.
In addition, the advent of the Internet and fiber optic cable technology will promote as the global service industry side exchanges that made the introduction of steamships percent iron hull fifty years earlier for international trade of agricultural and industrial products.
It will certainly a generation for these changes are felt everywhere.
Yet at the heart of the industrialized world of the rich countries there is already concern about these revolutions looming on the horizon.
In fact, these concerns will reinforce and sharpen as the fears of the citizens of the rich countries when trade barriers fall of international trade and the redistribution of wealth, social order and politics of the industrialized world will be shaken to their foundations.
For the world as a whole, however, the next two generations are ones that will bring tremendous opportunities for economic growth and world prosperity.
There may - well be a treasure chest at the end of history, after all.
The defeat of the Argentine neoliberalism.
In the 1990s, Argentina put in place policies which fell almost 80% of the neoliberal program.
It opened its economy to trade and international capital; she sought to guarantee low inflation and a stable currency.
It strove to improve its legal system so that its decisions are consistent with international law to generate some confidence when compliance with the contractual right, with or without pots - of - wine.
It did not work.
However, no one can say that the 1990s were disastrous, despite the consequences that led to the terrible summer of 2002.
Life was much more difficult during the Dirty War of the 1970s, when an army stripped of all honor threw women at the top of helicopters in the South Atlantic Ocean and the urban guerrilla firing on the people because ... because ... and just because!
The 1980s were hardly better.
Opening with a debt crisis at its peak caused by a massive rise in US interest rates and the dollar, the decade ended on a hyper - inflation generated from the inside, which caused a decline a decade to Argentina, lagging behind the international governing savings.
During the 1990s, by contrast, GDP per head Argentina grew 25%, with ups and downs, only to lose all of that increase in growth over the past four years.
Until late last winter, Argentina's problems seemed to be little more than - unpleasant but temporary blow, as the crisis of the "tequila" Mexican years 1994 - 1995 or crises the East Asia in the years 1997 - 1998 proved to be mere temporary interruptions, not turning.
Such optimism is impossible today, and there is little hope that the recent stock market crash of this country has only temporary effects.
The views of institutions such as the sub - US Secretary of State for Economy, John Taylor, is that the collapse of Argentina is due to its political class.
I do not share that view only in part.
Argentine leaders were repeatedly warned that keeping a constant exchange rate and linking the peso to the dollar was likely to cause an economic recession if the dollar increased.
Argentine politicians were also warned that their peso policy could not be sustained unless the ratio of national debt to GDP will fall.
Yet during the boom years, from 1993 to 1998, public spending exceeded sufficient tax revenues to get the debt / GDP ratio from 29 to 44%.
When the dollar is mounted and the recession took hold, some reaching politicians unable to balance the state budget in a timely manner did not show enough courage to balance the budget when position hardened.
The coup de grace was firmly told when the government decided (in crisis) maintain bank fixed deposits in dollars and remit the debt owed to banks into pesos, thereby bankrupt the entire financial system of a nation stroke of a pen.
The position of the ruling class is simple: If any of these three disastrous measures had been taken, Argentina would not have entered in crisis and could, at worst, suffered a mini crisis of the Mexican type.
The neoliberal agenda of Argentina of the 1990s was foolproof, according to this view, but Argentine politicians gave the image of a large clever fools community.
There is, however, another way to see the Argentine tragedy.
If we consider that the political system of the country has long behaved predictably, occurring with regularity of governments promising more than they could implement.
That promise to the rich oligarchy not to take too high taxes.
That promise workers and consumers generous social insurance system.
That promise rapid economic development, generous infrastructure spending, undemanding and enjoyable job for those who have political, etc ..
Overall, the promise indicated that any view of the national product always exceed the total of 100%.
Popular demand requiring the government meets all can never be satisfied.
Add to this an unfair distribution of wealth and income, lack of social engagement between the middle class and the working class and a long tradition of political violence, and the result is the perfect cocktail of a policy where all s' oppose all.
The fundamental political battle of the distribution of wealth in Argentina remains unresolved.
Any political force that tries to manipulate the auction promising only what it can accomplish is doomed to defeat.
In Argentina, the large budget deficits are a law of nature, a fact unwavering.
Thus, the Argentine interest rates can not fall and be affordable only for short periods of time and rare.
Everyone knows that the Argentine political system generates chronic deficits, and we know that it only indicates that the payment of interest on the debt were doomed to explode.
Because of the absolute lack of dynamic stability of the Argentine debt, indexation of the exchange rate on a strong currency could not last.
Free access to international capital markets and bank accounts in dollars involved only when indexing the exchange rate would conflict with the logic of the Argentine producer deficit policy, the result could only be catastrophic.
If the current crisis was deftly handled, if Argentina had lived another decade of rapid growth, conflicts arising from the redistribution of wealth would have been moderate.
After all, Europe before WWII was evidence of the worst political world: the riots cliques of extreme - right in France with general strikes of Great - Britain through the Civil War in Spain and Fascism in Italy, not to mention the aggressive consolidation of power in Germany by the Nazis.
Yet the Western Europe in the post - war encountered any problems of public order that found solution while maintaining the strong currency and growth.
I do not share that view only half though.
Yes, the Argentine government has made significant errors, its politicians sinned against the gods of monetary economics.
But the punishment was - it being so sharp and harsh?
The False Promises of private pensions.
One of the strangest statements made during the debate on social insurance today who come to disturb the richest country in the world raises the retirement programs funded by governments and whose benefits are fixed (such as diet US Social Security) are old-fashioned.
These programs were sufficient, the argument at the time of the Great Depression and the generation of the post - World War II, when the economy was based on the industry, but they have become obsolete for the high economy tech, networked, post - industrial today.
Advocates of this argument propose a different model.
Companies agree today to support the pensions of employees contributing to their private savings and governments today should offer (or require) to contribute to this private savings.
The value of these accounts varies by market and is not based on a defined benefit scheme that guarantees a fixed real sum of resources available upon retirement.
This argument is strange because it takes the economic situation the wrong way - hair.
When many companies offer their employees pensions to long-term fixed benefits, the government has no interest in setting up a parallel system of defined-benefit pensions and ask employees to participate.
After all, in this context, employees who attach great importance to the defined-benefit pension can go to work for companies that offer such systems.
The main advantages of a system where the government requires that employees also participate in a national social security system are accumulated for employees who really should attach great importance to the defined-benefit pension system without being able to actually determine their true preferences.
They are also accumulated for employees who do not have the ability to negotiate to encourage their boss to offer pensions they want to achieve and they really need.
There are few companies today ready to provide for long-term defined-benefit pension systems.
One reason is that companies nowadays are much more aware of their own long-term fragility than they were in the years following the Second World War.
Even IBM, the United States - United, which prides itself on its stability, will not take the risk of providing a pension system with fixed benefits.
The risk from the defined-benefit pensions used to be offset by two benefits for companies that offered these systems.
First, the fact that leaving the company usually meant a reversal of the savings at a discount increased employee loyalty.
Second, complaisant accountants optimistic assumptions on pension reserves benefits associated with the ability of large companies to take bigger risks, improved the financial statement that companies could report to investors.
Today, the risks are perceived as much larger and benefits as less good.
Therefore, employers are less likely to offer systems that look for some way to defined-benefit pensions.
This decline in defined-benefit pensions in all the rich countries of the world economy is not a good thing, because the configuration of prices of goods suggests that young and middle-aged employees attach great importance to systems fixed benefits.
Historically, the gap between expected profits on lower-risk assets such as treasury bills or the right investment and high-risk assets such as stocks and real estate was generally very large.
In sum, as some say economists, including Robert Barro of Harvard, and some mathematicians, as Benedict Mendelbrot, this may be due to the fact that risky investments are actually more risky than suggested by the theories and math standard financial techniques.
In my opinion, at least, this is due in part to the memory of 1930 and 2000, when the stock market has suffered greatly, which occupies too large a place in investors' minds.
Employees and other asset holders place a high value on the security and predictability, as a pension system from defined-benefit to them is invaluable.
But in today's world, only national governments are large enough to implement such systems and to ensure that pensions will be actually available when employees cease their activity.
I'm still enough social - democrat to believe that if there is an economic service or benefit that citizens place great importance and that only the government can provide, then it is his duty to provide it.
We know, we, economists, as there are many disadvantages to push the government out of its basic role of providing true public services such as defense, security and justice, while providing citizens incentives to counterbalance the effects of true market failures.
Where the private market has the flexibility of two hands, government bureaucracy has at best two thumbs.
But the collection of wage taxes to tens of millions of workers and the writing of millions of pension checks is one of dozens of routine tasks, semi - automatic and so the government can achieve.
When private companies withdrew systems with fixed benefits, it is even more important and valuable that the government realizes, as our post - industrial society into the network age, that it was by the past .
Islamist movements and the democratic paradox.
The wave of anger that shakes the Arab world after the publication in Denmark it a few months ago, a representative of the Prophet Muhammad cartoons, the victory of Hamas in Palestine and the increasing radicalization of the Iranian regime are "political Islam" a fundamental problem on the international stage.
But it can not be a single answer to all the questions that arise.
We must abandon the idea that there is a monolithic Islamic movement.
Political Islam has different forms that have emerged as the main alternative to secular Arab nationalist regimes whose legitimacy, based on the struggle for national liberation, has evaporated due to their inability to solve economic and social problems, establish the rule of law and guarantee fundamental freedoms.
In Palestine, for example, the Islamists have triumphed over Fatah because they have suffered for years its poor governance while enduring the hardships of Israeli occupation.
Long, America and Europe share an atavistic fear of the "Islamic alternative" to the nationalist and secular leaders such as Fatah and thereby defend the status - quo.
But monarchs and secular dictators of the Arab world have crushed all opposition, making mosques the only place behind which political commitment was possible.
Today, political Islam can no longer be contained, because democracy can not be built by pushing underground parties that have a strong social base. This was tragically demonstrated by the example of Algeria there 15 years.
The only alternative to authoritarianism is to achieve a transition that allows Islamists to participate in political life, while encouraging them to accept unequivocally the rules of the democratic game.
In many countries, more or less conservative Islamist parties are willing to play along.
It is not by chance that they are represented in the parliaments of all the countries undergoing political reforms, whether in Lebanon where Hezbollah is present in a democratically elected government of Jordan or Morocco.
In Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood has become a force to be reckoned with in Parliament, despite the limitations on the participation of Islamist groups in elections last year.
In Iraq, free elections have revealed the enormous influence of Islamist currents.
In Turkey, the transition to democracy brought to power an Islamist party, the Justice and Development Party.
Under his leadership, the Turkish government has undertaken various important democratic reforms and initiated negotiations on the admission of Turkey into the EU.
Islamist parties have nothing to do with Al Qaeda, even though some of the more conservative elements within them have ideological positions that may be close.
The risk of a political transition that would result in the victory of Islamist parties is a democratic paradox that Europe and the US must accept if they want to promote a political evolution that includes all political - that the exact opposed the imposition of democracy as it takes place in Iraq under occupation by foreign troops.
One of the most negative consequences of the intervention in Iraq was to reinforce the notion of "clash of civilizations" between the West and Islam that creates a climate favorable to Islamist movements.
The Muslim world has made political reforms before the "war against terrorism" and Muslim reformers did not wait for the EU to acquire political weight to act.
These movements were not created in the US or Europe after September 11 and they do not expect a signal or using them to act.
The success of moderate Muslims still may depend on the EU and the US attitude towards them.
It is not necessary to show that democracy is the best path for Palestinians to succeed in creating their state.
This depends largely on the direction taken by the new Hamas government and its transformation into a democratic force not respectful of the law, democracy and international law.
But it will also depend on Israel and the international community must do everything in their power to promote the emergence of a future Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.
Promote democracy among Palestinians does not stop the international community to ask Hamas to renounce terrorism, to demilitarize, respect the Palestinian constitution and recognize the existence of Israel.
But that does not mean we should impose sanctions on the Palestinian people after he expressed democratically.
If we want to strengthen the recent Palestinian democracy, that would be a terrible mistake that would have a negative impact in other Arab countries seeking to reform.
Likewise, recognize the right of non-violent Islamists to participate in politics does not mean the renunciation of political and ideological struggle to defeat ultra designs - conservative and sometimes totalitarian society.
Combating racism, defending tolerance and respect the religious feelings of others assumes no question the freedom of the press or accept censorship demanded by the Islamists, even if genuine religious feelings are hurt, as in the If the Danish cartoons.
Islamist conceptions of society that violate individual rights must be rebutted politically.
The political challenge is one of the paradoxes of democracy, which allows all ideas to compete freely with each other.
Political Islam is a risk, but we can reduce that by developing an appropriate strategy, adapted to each case, which goes in the direction of democracy, but not by denouncing the results of democratic choice.
The war against the "democratization".
The wars in Lebanon and Gaza seriously threaten democratic reform in southern Mediterranean Basin.
They inflicting heavy punishment on precisely those peoples of the region who conducted free and fair elections, and they undermine the legitimacy of Israel's democracy.
Last year, the "Cedar Revolution" has made Lebanon an example of democratization in the Arab world.
The enthusiasm with which the international community has welcomed these changes has fallen like a souffl√©. The elections that have recently taken place in Palestine - another longstanding international demand - are in the same case.
The signal is clear: it is preferable that Israel, the only country in the region to respect the rule of law, be surrounded by authoritarian regimes where election results are predictable than by democratic states where Islamists are likely to to power.
It happened in Palestine, and it could well happen in Egypt if elections are conducted freely and fairly.
Arab nationalist governments feel justified in resisting serious political reform and repression of domestic opposition, particularly the swelling Islamist movements.
It is now clear to everyone that democratization in the southern Mediterranean can not bypass Islamist movements, and that the success of the process depends largely on the degree to which the participation of these movements is ensured in the political arena.
Of course, even should - it renounce violence as a means to power.
Contain political Islam, or, try to "remove" Islamists militarily with total disregard for national political processes (and not to mention human life), is not a solution, because voters do not turn away for from Islamist movements.
The efforts of reformist governments in the region to integrate such movements into the public sphere have received a severe blow.
Democracies have long known that extreme and indiscriminate punishment - which by definition affects friend than enemy combatants and civilians - is a grave violation of international law, as has been observed Louise Arbour, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.
They also know that such action fuels radicalism and the effects we know only too well today.
Hezbollah is, after all, a creature of Lebanon's resistance to Israel's 1982 invasion, "Party of God" is trying to impose new home and in the region by presenting itself as the defender because of the Arab - Islamic, especially in Palestine.
Any reinforcement of its power will necessarily weaken Lebanon and democratic forces in the region.
The prolonged absence of genuine and active commitment of States - States in the peace process in the Middle - East is partly responsible for the current slump.
For nearly six years, they have not taken the diplomatic initiative to resolve the weight Palestinian question or to pursue the Syrian track (Israel still occupies the Golan Heights).
Moreover, even as we were beginning to think that the Iraqi tragedy had made the limits of unilateralism and preemptive military strategies, the Bush administration encourages Israel's military action - this time against a country that painfully been attempting to consolidate democratic reform and to reaffirm its sovereignty over Syria.
The most promising initiative Bush of promoting democracy throughout the Middle - East, was paralyzed by the Iraq war and the civil war that followed.
This project is buried under the weight of America's inability to protect Lebanon's fragile democracy and the democratic experiment in Palestine.
The feeble response of the European Union to the conflict raging in Gaza and Lebanon has oscillated between understanding and condemnation of the disproportionate response of Israel (not "eye for an eye", but "ten eyes for an eye" according to the Finnish Presidency of the EU Council), revealing how the Union depends States - United to end violence.
If this conflict does not encourage Europeans to speak with one voice, it means that they have learned nothing from disunity, and thus weakness, which has damaged them during the war in Iraq .
There should be a European initiative supported by credible military deterrent, gathering the EU forces, Turkey and Arab countries, is dispatched to Lebanon and Gaza as part of a UN mission.
Europe must not only demand a cease - - fire and put an end to the interference of Syria and Iran in Lebanon, but it must also provide the means to translate their requirements into practice and bring massive aid for the reconstruction of Lebanon.
The EU should strongly support the end of the embargo on Palestine and the urgent creation of a Palestinian state.
A common European front could persuade States - United to leave enough time in Lebanon and Palestine to consolidate their democratic processes, thus isolating the radical elements of Hamas and steering Hezbollah to dissolution of its private army.
The US project in ruins, a credible European policy to delegitimize war and support for democracy in the countries of the region is essential.
The environment of the economy.
No economy is a closed universe, autonomous, governed by laws independent of law, morality and politics.
The most interesting economic questions are generally located on the border of neighboring disciplines.
This can not be clearer than in the interaction between economic processes and the environment.
The special feature of this exchange is not to be governed by the laws of mechanics, but by those of thermodynamics, including the law of entropy that the amount of free energy may be converted into mechanical work diminishes with time - an irreversible process culminating in the 'heat death'.
Under the leadership of Nicholas Georgescu - Roegen - whose work on the relationship between economic processes and physics were pioneers - many researchers tried unsuccessfully to formulate a theory 'entropy' of the economy and society, especially during the 1970s.
The entropic view assumes that because of its multiple interactions with nature, economic processes produce irreversible consequences.
We draw from stocks of non-renewable natural resources (oil and mineral resources, for example) and degrade or qualitatively modify other resources (eg water and agricultural land) by imposing a higher rate of exploitation of their ability to regeneration.
The non-renewable resource stocks also releases the 'speed' of economic growth ecologically pace, which contributes to the degradation of the biosphere, including irreversible climate change.
The law of entropy reminds us that we leave to future generations and less natural heritage and probably less suited to their needs than the one we inherited.
Unfortunately, there are no simple solutions.
By what principle could - economic dynamism in order to reduce their demand for natural resources of the planet we ask China and India to limit?
The lower growth in developed countries is not the result of a voluntary self-limitation, but our much higher standard of living and our inability to solve our own economic imbalances.
We can not impose the poorest we ecological rhythm, then that is the fact we will be released which has enriched us!
For a similar reason, the decrease or even stagnation are not the solution in developed countries: it would mean either that one accepts existing inequalities, whether we impose a redistribution scheme tending to 'equal distribution of resources.
It would be a choice between an unsustainable cynicism and a totalitarian utopia.
But fortunately for us, our evolution not only depends on the entropy, but also the increase of knowledge and technical progress - just as irreversible as the decrease of non-renewable resource stocks or degradation environment.
Thus, the economy is entropic for resources and historical for the production, organization and dissemination of knowledge. The prospects for sustainable development in economic and environmental terms fit in the space provided between these two dynamic processes: the level of growth we choose must be based on a sufficient level of knowledge to ensure the sustainability of the system.
Or nature as knowledge are public goods that require state intervention to be 'products' in sufficient quantity.
The only solution to the problem of the finiteness of our world is to maintain as much space as possible between entropy and history by investing in education and research with a view to increasing the share of renewable energy, reduce consumption energy related to our standard of living and slow the rate of exploitation of natural resources.
Such a strategy may seem useless if it serves only to disengage us to allow others to get rich faster.
But seen as doing the mastering two dynamic processes, the solution of ecological constraints could be a growth accelerator.
Race to embryonic cells continues.
Scientific research is usually conducted to improve our lives, but it is also an industry, one that represents a massive investment by governments and businesses.
The challenges and potential benefits of research subjects, few, are exceptionally high, which is why the recent announcement that the Korean scientist Hwang Woo - suk fabricated his research results on embryonic cells have been so repercussion.
This episode highlights the ongoing race in medical research that is played in the field of embryonic cells.
This is probably one of the biggest challenges in medical history that is accessible to all and everyone, really everyone could hit the jackpot.
The last big scientific race of this type dates back to the deciphering of the human genome, which promises to alter future lives radically.
That study was initiated by the states - united from discoveries made in the wake of the atomic bombing of Japan to understand the extent of genetic damage in long terms.
The currently deployed research effort on stem cells and their potential is just as important because it will allow a complete medical revolution just as important.
A stem cell is special because it can reproduce a shape which is different to it.
Whereas a skin cell or a liver, for instance, can reproduce only more skin or liver, stem cells, which are the most robust at the beginning of human development, the cells are "prototypes".
When a fertilized egg into an embryo and fetus, these original embryonic cells show one way or another to the cells how to become skin, in liver, eye, or bone.
We need to know how this transformation is triggered.
Such knowledge would lead to huge advances that could lead to patents.
Most attention is focused on genetic diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and myopathy.
In these cases - there, the stem cells would be encouraged to restore nerve tissue.
This would also benefit patients with cervical lesions or spine, any patient who has suffered a stroke and paralyzed.
This gains in parallel also fields such as gene therapy.
An embryonic cell changes its identity through a process of "tripping", a signal which activates the literally liver cell gene in the embryonic version of the cell.
When scientists figure out how to flip these switches, it may - be possible to introduce stem cells in the human body and activate them so that they correctly replace damaged tissue, whatever they are.
It is not surprising, given its huge potential, as teams of scientists have been mobilized almost everywhere to engage in research on embryonic cells.
The race has become a dramatic since the leading player in research, states - the US, get emerged due to the influence of religion on politics (although the state of California has decided to not to miss out, and recently approved a $ 3 million grant for research on embryonic cell).
Because the promise is so great, the science does not require massive infrastructure, many smaller countries have rushed into the void created by States - States in this field to take advantage.
Any competent medical research center can enter the race, whether in Mexico, Ethiopia, Indonesia or Yemen.
The winner will bring to the economy of his country the equivalent of a Saudi oil field.
But even if everyone can win, science at this level is not just a simple "eureka", with some single breakthrough suddenly ending the race.
Discoveries occur incrementally, and, because it is science, each step is announced and tested.
Thus the institutions involved in the research can gain momentum, the leaders sweeping up talent, resources and prestige in intellectual ecology is not easy.
Found in the general competition many other small races, which jostle for early, impressive results.
In May 2005, Hwang's research center in Seoul reported the first major achievement.
They said they had developed a technique whereby new, perfect stem cells could be cloned from ordinary ones.
This was big news, for it implied that sufficient numbers of stem cells could be made without controversy, thus allowing anyone to do quality research while avoiding what US President George W . Bush has described as "the use of a life to save a life."
In addition, the Koreans did a common thing these days: they claimed patent rights over the process.
One could almost believe for a moment that South Korea would become a world superpower in health matters.
We now know that the Seoul researchers made up the case of any room.
The investigation by an investigative panel of the Seoul National University found that embryonic cells "cloned" were actually created by in vitro fertilization.
This fraud has bewildered the science community, particularly the fact that the statement of Korean researchers made was so transparently false.
Why did - then they put their careers and reputations at stake?
Medical research has always faced many challenges, even when the scientific quest was simply one of discovery.
Today, the challenges are complicated by politics, market forces, and national interests.
With stem cell research, huge fortunes depend on which group takes the lead, wherever their laboratory is located.
As the competition heats up, we should expect amazing developments, and no doubt other subterfuges in public relations.
Islam and Asian Chinese diaspora.
When Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, recently announced that he intended to resign, Malaysians of Chinese descent joined the Malay party loyalists Mahathir asking him to reconsider.
When Mahathir agreed to stay, if only for another 16 months, the sighs of relief prompted by these Chinese Malaysians were the most audible to all.
The fact that ethnic Chinese Malaysians are joined on the side of Dr Mahathir marks a quiet revolution in Malaysian politics, which demonstrates how Mahathir nationalist image has softened during his 22 years in power.
It also shows how ethnic Chinese have changed their opinion about the nationalist movement that previously seemed so hostile.
In the overthrow of colonial leaders of South - East Asia four decades ago, ethnic Chinese have often fled the nationalist movements that fought for independence.
Some movements saw the local Chinese as outsiders or as intrinsically disloyal for having taken advantage of years of imperial rule disproportionately.
Anti collective violence - Chinese was widespread in the region.
In the decades that followed, most Chinese have continued to be wary of political parties linked to former national liberation movements.
This fear is beginning to dissipate in Malaysia.
Malaysian Chinese citizens now view Premier Mahathir as a bastion against a new form of violent extremism: the threat posed by Islamic fundamentalism.
Such a bulwark is a need for members of the vast Chinese diaspora across Southeast Asia - is not only in Malaysia, where Islamic extremism remains a small threat, but also in Indonesia where thousands of Chinese were killed and injured in rioting in recent years, and where thousands more have seen their property damaged or lost.
Most ethnic Chinese in South - East Asia as a gemstone admire the presence of even a hint of allegiance to a secular distinction between faith and state in a Muslim leader.
When this distinction exists among Islamic believers like Mahathir, evidence of secular tolerance represents a rare sign of modernity and commitment to progress.
Dr. Mahathir has always been a modernist with a cool head.
He recently began to admit that political "The first Malay" he encouraged since 1969 have failed to give birth to a skilled Malay elite essential to a new modern economy.
Mahathir calls young Malays to work harder even though he is well aware that such an appeal is unpopular.
Much of this new tone in ethnic politics in Malaysia has gone unnoticed because of the uproar surrounding Mahathir's efforts to discredit his former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim.
This smear campaign Anwar has cost Mahathir's party, United Malay National Organisation (UMNO), much of his support among ethnic Malays.
Indeed, during the 1999 national elections, Mahathir retained power only through the Chinese voters.
The non-Malays hope that now reconsider the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãspecial treatment for ethnic Malays.
Such reform always been an anathema among Malays.
Ethnic Chinese in Malaysia are also impressed by the clever answer from Dr Mahathir to US demands to fight against terrorism.
The Prime Minister used this opportunity to soften his image of man opposed to the West reaffirming his modernist and secular position against those who sympathized with Islamic extremism.
In doing so, he revitalized the multicultural base of the National Alliance who led Malaysia since independence was proclaimed in 1957.
This has allowed him to rally the Chinese community in Malaysia at his side.
Put Contrast this with the Chinese in Indonesia, a country where everything secular and modern is associated with political and cultural conformity with the state - nation.
For thirty years, former President Suharto systematically established a racial discrimination against ethnic Chinese, while promoting privileged few comrades who helped his family and military colleagues make huge ill-gotten profits.
In the eyes of the indigenous majority remained poor, such favoritism portrayed the Chinese as corrupt and greedy unscrupulous people.
Despite the memories of the massacre at the Chinese anti purges of the 1960s, Indonesia's Chinese were not prepared to face immense hatred deployed during the riots of May 1998 where arson and looting and rape collective of several Chinese women swept the Chinese community.
Such violence still casts a shadow over ethnic relations in Indonesia.
Successive Indonesian governments headed by Presidents Habibie, Abdulrahman Wahid and Megawati Sukarnoputri all encouraged the Chinese to play a leading role customary in the trade.
However, Indonesian officials are reluctant to guarantee the Chinese that they retain equal rights as citizens and they have allowed various forms of discrimination to crack.
The current tensions between secularists, religious believers, and various Muslim extremist groups in Indonesia have rejected the Chinese in the shadows, allowing many of them to resume their economic role in increasing uncertainty conditions.
But the personal security they seek and that ethnic Chinese in Malaysia are going to get is still as distant as ever.
Indeed, it is highly unlikely that Indonesia produces a leader on which they could rely in the same way that the Chinese in Malaysia now rely on Prime Minister Mahathir.
Football and Philosophy.
Gooooal ! ! !
Serenity divine or infernal burns, according to team scoring: ours or theirs.
How the trajectory of a bullet can - it being responsible for so much happiness or pain?
I spent weeks sitting in front of my TV to watch the World Cup.
My wife threatened to divorce and take other disciplinary action.
What is the source of this attraction, this magic?
The game world is our perpetual Garden of Eden.
We may at any time abandon our reality for liberty, innocence and happiness of the game.
Football and the Garden of Eden?
What - in common?
Each defines a sacred sphere of freedom and order, innocence, spirituality and justice in relation to our chaotic everyday world, slavery, unjust and guilt.
The chessboard, the tennis court, the soccer field: within their scope, we feel free, because in these places, it is we who decide the rules without being subject to the iron law of the outside world.
It feels innocent, too, because the game world is also a world of innocence: a Garden of Eden before the Fall.
Here we can be childish and selfish, we can satisfy our need for achievement, power and domination, and all without any guilt.
In the game world, freedom is generated, paradoxically, by restrictions.
Soccer, the basic rule is simple: the ball must move, the central point in the nets of one of two goal cages.
If the ball was heading directly from the center point to a cage, his path would be, or seem to be, strictly determined and the whole would be pretty boring.
To create some freedom, the settlement occurs in the way the ball is managed to complicate the trip.
First, two teams of 11 players are placed on the ground with the mission to place the ball in the cage goals.
Then they are asked to put the ball in the cage of the goals of the other side.
With twenty-two players with their own skill and will, through various movements of confrontation and cooperation, the number of possible combinations is so high to infinity.
As a result, it lacks only one factor in creating a real world happy surprises, freedom and happiness: the ball.
The balloons are the most important elements in the "creative freedom" in our lives.
A ball is freedom personified.
It can rebound in any direction.
It seems to be provided with a free will.
It is an object, and yet it seems to be free.
With the introduction of chance and unpredictability factor in the game, the ball transforms a bitter fight human and down to earth in an epiphany of spirituality and freedom.
According to his fast movements, chance and men will interact, dance, somersault with one another.
The ball springs here and there full of carefree irresponsibility, between human will and chance, freedom and limitation, success and failure, hope and despair, to bounce into the world of hope in the next moment.
It has its own universe.
It moves in the sphere of the sacred.
But the sacred does not exist without the profane.
The football field is bounded and opposed to the surrounding world.
The experience and the sacred ceremony would be incomplete if tension between the field and the stands did not exist.
The clear emerald field and freedom of the game must be opposed to the screaming crowd of the darkness of the stands, burning red torches and forth - sudden returns between the joyous ecstasy and hellish misery.
In our daily lives, reason and passions are mixed.
Football (and other sports) separates these two areas and between them.
All passions, emotions and instincts are pushed towards the audience.
They are furious and incense, prance and explode, eventually reaching catharsis (if their team wins) or hell (if their team loses).
At the same time, they watch, perceive and are experiencing the freedom of Apollonian or Platonic game that takes place on the field.
Yes, players move in a world of spirituality.
They act according to clear, sacred rules.
When they play, they are supposed to act as pure rational beings who leave behind the passions and emotions, fears and intimate greeting their lives.
They move in a world of pure morality and justice.
The world of football is a world of justice and complete impartiality; perfect equality of opportunity, one does not get everyday.
Even the added benefit of the wind direction is under control.
The teams change ends at half - time.
Where and when to see - is the privileged and the underprivileged change sides in the real world?
Players, too, are not intended to derogate from the rules.
If they do, they are punished, and they start, they are excluded from the game.
They are excluded from the sphere of spirituality and we see them disappearing into the cold hells dressing rooms.
The definitive expulsion from Paradise occurs only if the sanctity of the game was profaned, if the spell is broken: by the fallen players to their angelic role and engaging in a fight on the ground, a cheater will, by the public including a match has been arranged by spectators invading the field.
Such events long marked the public and the community.
It is a bitter shock to realize the fragility of our world of freedom, spirituality, dignity and to awaken again (as we will do when the winner of the World Cup will be known) in our world nothing less than hostile.
Egypt needs a president, not a pharaoh.
A heated debate over political reforms currently shaking Egypt.
Emanating from all opposition parties and groups from civil society, essentially about a request for amendment of the Constitution of 1971 and the abolition of the state of emergency declared in 1981apr√®s Sadat's assassination .
These applications are nothing new.
President Mubarak and the National Democratic Party who oppose it supports since the mid-1980s.
But, given the disturbing turn of events in Egypt in the region and - beyond the requirement of the reforms now taking a compelling character ,.
Domestically, the 76-year-old Mubarak and his health is of concern.
The rumors about running for years, but they have officially acknowledged until November 2003, when it was no longer possible to hide the situation.
While speaking to Parliament, Mubarak fainted in front of millions of viewers.
Although he returned an hour later to finish his speech, Egyptians began to demand greater transparency both regarding the president's health as the functioning of the state.
At the same time, the deterioration of the economic situation, high unemployment and widespread corruption led to despair part of youth.
More than half of Egypt's population was born under the presidency of Mubarak.
According to a recent UN report, half of young people between 15 and 30 years old dream of emigrating to Europe, North America or Australia.
Weekly articles speak of Egyptians who drown in the Mediterranean as they try to smuggle in Europe.
There are a few weeks, several youngsters suffocated to death while being deported to Egypt in crowded trucks across the Libyan desert.
This case has caused an uproar that compelled the authorities to arrest, interrogate and prosecute the Egyptian police officers in charge.
The situation in the region and in the world has also emboldened the opposition, not only to demand reforms, but also to amend articles of the Constitution that pertain to the presidency.
According to persistent rumors, Mubarak, who has been re-elected four times, would seek a sixth term or establish a kind of "hereditary republic". Groom his son Gamal, 41, to succeed him in the image of Syrian President Hafez al - Assad and his son Bashar.
The opposition battle cry is No, No to the re-election of Mubarak and Gamal Not to succeed him.
Many Egyptians have nothing against Gamal Mubarak per se, but they are mortified at the idea that after the father suffered for 24 years, they may be sentenced the son for the same duration.
Of 211 articles of the current constitution, which dates from October 1971, 30 relate to the presidency.
The president is nominated by a majority of two thirds of the People's Assembly is then ratified in a plebiscite that can not be answered by yes or no.
The presidential term of six years, acquired and a simple majority is renewable indefinitely in this way.
These lax procedures contrast jarringly with the presidential power.
The president is both head of state and commander in chief, he chairs the Supreme Judicial Council, the police and the Council of Ministers. It has the discretion to appoint and dismiss one or more Vice - Presidents.
He appoints the Prime Minister and key ministers and approved the appointment of other ministers, ambassadors and senior officials.
He can call general elections, declare war, impose a state of emergency, and issue decrees that have the force of law.
There are no checks and balances.
One article states that "the President may be impeached for high treason or any other criminal act if a motion by at least one third of the people's Assembly members is approved by two-thirds."
The president is then suspended from office and replaced by the Vice - President pending the conclusion of the process.
But Mubarak has never enacted the necessary legislation for the implementation of this article nor appointed a vice - president, despite repeated requests from all sides.
This resulted in a de facto "imperial presidency," with Mubarak in place of the pharaoh.
No other head of state in modern times enjoys his hands as much power as him.
In Egypt, more readily compared to Brezhnev who presided over two decades of stagnation and decline of the Soviet Union.
Similarly, the position of Egypt as a regional power under Mubarak collapsed.
On the economic front, the flow of foreign investment tumbled 3 billion per year in the mid-1990s to some ridiculous 300 million in 2003.
Demands for reform are now focused on the election of the president by popular vote with at least two candidates and the banning of more than two consecutive terms.
But we must also reduce presidential power in what is abusive and create effective mechanisms for all government officials without exception are held accountable for their actions.
If Mubarak and his government did nothing to that claimed constitutional amendments are adopted, more and more Egyptians flee the regime and risk their lives to seek salvation elsewhere.
Bush no longer play the Gulf.
President Bush asked Americans not to "play politics" at this time of terrible national disaster.
But ask embarrassing questions to the leaders of our nation's exactly what democracy requires, when the government's response to Hurricane Katrina is widely viewed as "a national disgrace."
Katrina has announced his arrival at least two days in advance, but the authorities have been slow to launch an evacuation order.
No transport was available to those who had no money, no car; reception and care of refugees facilities were inadequate, the necessary forces were not in place to deliver the absolutely essential provisions or to ensure order and the number of boats, helicopters and other equipment needed rescue of those who found themselves stranded was far from sufficient.
Hampered by a National Guard with 40% of the workforce are in Iraq, mobilization of military gear to the most affected areas was a slow unusual.
For four days, there simply was no central control and light control.
As a result, many victims have suffered and died.
This failure is largely due to the Bush administration policies, which effectively eroded the capacities of the Federal Agency of emergency management (Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA), the government agency whose primary mission is to manage disasters.
Obsessed with the war against terrorism as well as the ideology of privatization of government functions, the administration has systematically undermined the capacity of FEMA to avoid disasters in the long term or at least cushioning where prevention is possible .
FEMA has been restricted and demoted from his cabinet position, then placed under the Department of National Security.
Its mission planning and disaster preparedness has been completely ousted in favor of the fight against terrorists.
Its leaders have no experience in disaster management.
The previous director was a Texan political cronies Bush and the current director's qualifications include the job of Commissioner with the judges and the order of the International Arabian Horse Association service, where he was forced to resign "lack of supervision."
Since 2001, billions of dollars have been deferred aid to disaster management to national security and the war in Iraq.
Programs - key emergency disaster had their budgets melt like snow in the sun and federal funds have been cut in half.
The Army Corps of Engineers budget for levee construction in New - Orleans was looted, including the funds specifically allocated to control urban flooding south - western Louisiana.
Preventive measures to protect people and property have not been implemented despite the findings of FEMA even in 2001 specifying that a major hurricane that hit New - Orleans was one of three "disasters most likely and most catastrophic that could hit the country. "
Convinced that FEMA was a "disproportionate social program" and that "the work of government is not to provide services", the first FEMA director instituted Bush external supply requirements as part of a major privatization effort.
This has caused a brain drain as many frames FEMA have turned to the private sector.
Privatization has also put the states and the poorest communities in a particularly vulnerable situation.
As funding dried up and federal programs were handed over to private firms at higher rates, only States and most wealthy and politically consequential communities could afford to pretend to scarce federal grants necessary to pay for services.
For example, Florida (with 16 more votes than Louisiana and whose governor is the president's brother) received the requested funding to protect its wetlands.
In contrast, Louisiana, which has more substantial needs (with its incredible 24% poverty rate), was in 2004 denied his request fund to avoid flooding.
Since the ability to Louisiana to protect was weakened and disaster management center undermined, inadequate government response and unnecessary destruction were almost inevitable. And it is the poor who paid the price.
But the reasons for the failure of this administration beyond the voluntary and chronic diversion of resources programs to protect people from disasters.
Despite scientific evidence showing that the intensity and the increasing frequency of hurricanes are related to climate change, the Bush administration rejects participation in international programs to preserve the climate.
Rather than enforce the prohibition of development swamps instituted by previous administrations, the Bush has chosen to delete it.
Erosion caused by urban development has brought 30km the Gulf of Mexico land compared to 1965, hurricanes are able to concentrate more power and cause winds and waves at the speed and destructive power ever stronger .
Similarly, the reduction of wetlands threatened levees of New - Orleans, built on the principle that 60 to 80 km of protective wetlands act as a buffer between the city and the Gulf of Mexico.
Despite every major study showing that a rehabilitation program for large-scale coastal and building higher levees were needed to protect New - Orleans, the government allowed federal agencies to stop protecting 8,000 acres of wetlands , developers to drain thousands of acres and in 2004 was reduced by more than 80% of the funding for holding back the waters of Lake Pontchartrain.
New - Orleans has sounded the alarm in America.
Ideologies of privatization that prevent effectively govern and enable privileged to save themselves while the poor have to climb on roofs, must now be challenged.
This disaster is a terrible reminder of what happens when government fails to protect its citizens, and it is imperative that Americans demand accountability.
Officials who have not done their job must be returned, and elected officials whose policies aggravated the devastation of Katrina fired.
We owe it to the dead and survivors.
Fall of the Commander.
Only Gabriel Garcia Marquez could find the right words to describe awaiting the death of Fidel Castro.
His novel Autumn of the Patriarch captures perfectly the moral squalor, political paralysis, and savage ennui that enshrouds a society awaiting the death of a long-term dictator.
The departure of Fidel Commander of power is only a matter of biology, and the few pictures of him that have emerged since he took ill last year clearly show biology at work.
When the end comes, change in Cuba could be as vast as any of those who welcomed the end of the great dictators of the last century.
Stalin, Franco, Tito, Mao: their methods and means all looked alike.
How they passed from the scene was often very different however, and these differences can shape societies for years and decades after their death.
Take the example of the Soviet Union.
March 9, 1953, the Gulf of Finland to the Bering Sea, everything stopped, as in Warsaw, Budapest, Prague and Berlin - East.
In Beijing, Mao Zedong himself - even bowed low before an immense effigy of Joseph Stalin.
Huge mourning crowds, crying, nearly hysterical, could be seen all over the vast empire Stalin had ruled.
Yet within days, the word Stalinism was removed from a new Soviet dictionary, and three years later my grand - father, Nikita Khrushchev, denounced the "personality cult" of Stalin in his famous "secret speech" at twentieth Communist Party Congress.
The thaw that followed was short-lived, but for the first time in Soviet history the possibility of change was opened - possibility that Mikhail Gorbachev seized in 1985.
The death of Josip Broz Tito brought forth an outpouring of any kind.
For decades, his rule had imposed a false unity in Yugoslavia.
After his death in 1980, that artificial state began to unravel, culminating in the genocidal wars in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo in the 1990s.
But all the long dictatorships do not end in disintegration and chaos.
Mao's death allowed the return from exile of Deng Xiaoping in disgrace.
Deng quickly routed the heirs of the "gang of four" and in a few years opened China's economy, fueling a capitalist revolution that transformed China more fully and with more success, that the socialist revolution Mao had ever done.
Of course, the Communist Party remains in power, and Mao's portrait still looms over Tiananmen Square.
But both of them are only relics of ideas and ideals that in reality have been relegated to the trash can of history.
Spain, too, escaped violent dissolution when the fascist dictatorship Generalissimo Francisco Franco collapsed at his death.
The old dictator can take credit for this success, since restaurant monarchy of King Juan Carlos just before he died, he gave Spain a foundation on which to rebuild.
Franco was far from imagining that Juan Carlos would build, with the help of an intelligent and young Franco-era bureaucrat named Adolfo Suarez, the modern, democratic Spain of today.
It is no accident that communist countries were (and are) usually run by geriatric leaders, and democracies by younger men and women.
This difference is important.
Old leaders can preside successfully over smoothly running countries, which do not require further review their policies and objectives.
There are exceptions to this rule, of course - Churchill, Adenauer, Deng, Reagan - but states can not count on fortune bringing their exceptional leader.
Younger leaders are more likely to be able to manage and change of difficult times.
Political competition compels all politicians, whatever their age, to stay alert and anticipate problems, and remain open to new ideas.
No one can be installed in his high office to wait idly that death or own boredom.
One-party systems, dictatorships playing on the charisma of one man or a mixture of the two, as in Tito's Yugoslavia, are a guarantee of sclerotic minds and inert governments.
What will become of Cuba after Fidel's death?
Many observers portray Ra√∫l Castro, the younger brother of Fidel and his designated successor, as a pragmatist - the "practical Castro."
When Soviet largesse ceased in the early 1990s, it was Ra√∫l who understood that the regime's survival depended on economic reforms and has lobbied to allow private agricultural markets are reopened to boost production and avoid possible famine.
However, this is the same man who, as head of the internal security apparatus of Cuba, represented for many years the regime's iron fist and is directly responsible for the imprisonment, and often the torture of thousands of dissidents.
So can - be the best we can hope for is an experience with the Russian liberalization quickly suppressed by the old guard of the nervous system.
In addition, with the support of oil-rich allies like Venezuela's President Hugo Ch√°vez - and with the recent discovery of oil reserves off the Cuban coast, introducing reforms could well become less urgent.
In that case, Ra√∫l may try to cling firmly to the fossilized system that he helped create and maintain with such brutality.
Ra√∫l Castro's it - even an old man, so we can hope that Deng or, better yet, a Suarez, emerges from the sinking of the Castro.
That said, for the moment, the younger Cuban communist officials, like Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque, remain fanatical ideology that many Cubans nicknamed "los Taliban."
If they take power and keep the finger on the trigger, Cuba could be facing a new and very long biology lesson.
The ECB now serves as an anchor to Europe.
The time has come for the European Central Bank to build a reputation.
Barely a month after the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty of the European Union in France and the Netherlands - the Netherlands, the recent summit of the European Union in Brussels ended in an acrimonious orgy of national egoism and no agreement is found on the EU budget.
With Europe in the midst of political turmoil, the ECB should appear as a stabilizing anchor.
Europe is suffering from a deep crisis of confidence that hampers economic recovery.
Consumers, lacking confidence in the ability of their political leaders to solve the multiple problems saving for a rainy day they feel very close, while businessmen have been reluctant to invest because they do not trust governments to implement the necessary economic reforms.
As demonstrated by the shameful summit in Brussels, this lack of confidence in the political leadership of the EU is quite justified.
Instead of acting effectively and constructively on the problems of Europe - the reform of state systems of expensive medical protection for improved global competitiveness - Europe's political leaders are hiding behind false arguments about "Anglo models - Saxon ultra - liberal ", the British budget rebate and high interest rates, as if the economic weaknesses were due to errors of the ECB.
To undermine the independence of the ECB, European finance ministers are seeking to gain more weight in decision-making bank.
Jean - Claude Juncker, Luxembourg Prime Minister and Eurogroup President, testifying before the "Economic and Financial Affairs" of the Parliament of the European Union, said that the ministers of euro zone finance should be more aggressive in expressing their positions vis - a - vis the ECB. He called for "open and frank" talks between the ministers of the Eurogroup and the ECB.
Who needs these talks?
On the common set, ministers of euro zone finance want to discuss the fall in interest rates, which does not help the economic recovery of Europe.
The ECB has already extended the period of monetary stability that Europe is with interest rates at the lowest in years.
Can - we really believe that consumers will not consume - and businessmen postponing their investments - in anticipation of the next lower interest rates?
To paraphrase Keynes, we can not make him drink a donkey that is not thirsty.
"The last thing Europe needs now is a reduction in interest rates," said an influential member of the Governing Council of the ECB in a candid assessment of the current situation. Capitulate under the blows of the external pressure does not represent a good definition of a "stabilizing anchor."
The euro would collapse, and the ECB would lose all credibility as a central bank.
In addition, the chief economist of the ECB, Otmar Issing, provides that long-term interest rates will go up rather than down, because inflation expectations are rising.
Thus, the reduction in interest rates would not only be wrong, it would be especially crazy.
But the ECB will not cut interest rates, even if it claims that it would be possible to hold political wolves at bay.
The ECB continues, and in doing so it proves to European citizens that there is at least one EU institution they can trust.
This is extremely important.
History shows that political turmoil lead to inflation, which in turn feeds always more political unrest.
Europeans can bet their last euro the ECB: it will not leave his young common currency be ravaged by inflation because political leaders have failed in their task now fear losing their charge.
Indeed, the courage has been showing the ECB in sticking to its principles should serve as a model for future European politicians.
Once they realize they can not force the ECB rate cuts unnecessary and destructive interests, while European leaders may find - be the courage to govern, which, after all, is why they elected.
Rush succession of Arafat.
To understand what the Palestinian cause will look like without Yasir Arafat, consider the various titles that he currently holds.
Arafat is Chairman of the PLO Executive Committee, President of the Palestinian National Authority, commander of the Palestinian forces and leader of the Fatah movement.
The PLO embodies Palestinian national aspirations for independence and the will to become a state.
It is the highest political body for all Palestinians, both those living in Palestine and the refugees and other Palestinians in the diaspora.
Arafat's successor will need to juggle between negotiations with Israel, which will require concessions on the "right of return" of refugees in Palestine, and aspirations of more than three million Palestinians who wish to return to the homes from which they were expelled during the wars of 1948 and 1967.
Arafat's successor as President of the Palestinian National Authority will be bound by the Oslo Accords, which created an interim government, now headed by Prime Minister Ahmad Qurei, that is responsible for the daily lives of Palestinians living on the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The Palestinians will have to decide if the President of the PNA occupy a strong position or merely symbolic, as is currently the case.
The second option would make Qurei an empowered prime minister, the wishes of many Palestinians and others.
The position of the commander of the Palestinian forces up so - called various military units, security and Palestinian information in the hands of one leader, who is supposed to uphold the law.
But these forces are now in disarray, the majority of Palestinian security agencies in uniform to be reorganized after four years of intensive effort by Israel to crush them.
The major factor in internal security is local paramilitary units.
These units, most of which are not controlled by the central management of the ANP, are more loyal to the leaders of the base as ANP officers in uniform.
Local Fatah leaders like Marwan Barghouti have tremendous power over the nationalist armed units that are loosely organized under the title of Martyrs Brigades Al Aqsa.
Barghouti advocated and tried to implement internal Fatah elections when the Israelis arrested him.
As a street leader elected president of the council of university students Birzeit, he gained legitimacy by being chosen by his peers.
When the Oslo trial began, he refused to accept any official position within the Palestinian Authority, choosing instead to remain close to the local Fatah cadres.
Who takes Arafat's place will have to ensure that these brigades are satisfied that their status, demands, and leaders are respected.
Indeed, the power struggle that will ensue in the post - Arafat will focus ultimately on Al Fatah, the backbone of the PLO.
A world assembly will choose the Fatah Revolutionary Council, which is composed of 100 members, which will in turn elect a central committee of 20 members, in which concentrate the major part of the struggle for power.
Many young street leaders will insist on an emergency meeting of the revolutionary council, or even holding the sixth general assembly (which will be the first since 1988).
The events of recent months show that the Martyrs Brigades Al Aqsa have forced even Arafat to take their demands into consideration.
While most of the power struggle will take place within the nationalist camp, he does not forget the Islamist camp led by Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
Although it is unlikely that the Islamists interfere in the struggle for power post - Arafat, they will not sit idly by if the new leadership starts in the wrong direction.
Obviously, the new leader will have to reach an agreement with the Islamists regarding the rules of the game, both on the national territory vis - a - vis Israel.
Without this agreement and if the new leader raging hard against the Islamists, a violent civil war could erupt.
More importantly, in order to consolidate its leadership, the next Palestinian leader must make tough measures and show concrete results very quickly.
The experience of the first Palestinian prime minister, who resigned largely because of his inability to make improvements to his people (especially in terms of personal and collective security, respect for the law and end the chaos reign in Palestinian areas), still fresh in the memory of the people.
At the same time, a freeze on settlement activities, release of Palestinian political prisoners, including Marwan Barghouti, and the removal of hundreds of checkpoints between Palestinian cities would revive a feeling of hope, without which no Palestinian leader can not negotiate what the world wants: a peace agreement.
The problem is that no Palestinian leader, whoever he is, can not make these changes.
They represent a direct challenge to the Israeli occupiers, neighboring Arab countries and the international community, led by the United - States.
The Moscow Mystery of 2008.
Usually at this time, people are obsessed with what will bring them the new year.
In Russia, the real uncertainty concerns 2008, not 2007.
Indeed, today we can reduce Russian policy to one subject: President Vladimir Putin he will stay on as president after 2008, despite repeatedly stating that it will not?
And if he gives way, which he groom as his replacement?
The runner it will be for one of the warring factions in the Kremlin?
Or he pick an "outsider"?
Unless Putin maintains his ultimate arbiter and decision maker in the country, there is great risk of fierce infighting rage.
In an environment where power and property are inseparable and all government institutions are emasculated, a major transfer of authority may lead to violent redistribution.
Resolving these questions is vital for Russia's political elites who are anxious to preserve the current perks and gain others.
Regarding the public, the vast majority appears resigned to accepting whatever is arranged by the government.
Some 45% of Russians believe that Putin will name a successor, and that person will become the new president.
Almost a quarter believe that the constitution will be changed so that Putin can have a third term.
In one way or another, it is almost universally recognized that the transfer of the universal authority is masterminded at the top and endorsed at the ballot box.
The balance of forces in the legislature will be, too, determined by the Kremlin.
In recent years, the configuration of the political parties and the law on elections have been repeatedly modified to accommodate the interests of the ruling elite.
Therefore, unwanted forces have no chance in the parliamentary elections in December.
Foreigners in politics, ordinary Russians are indifferent to everything that does not immediately affect them, and seek to hold anyone accountable.
They were not bothered by the recent murder of journalist Anna Politkovskaya, or the assassination of Andrey Kozlov, vice - president of the central bank, or the implications of Alexander Litvinenko poisoning (a majority of respondents in a poll said he was killed by his "business partners.").
This alienation between the state and the people has a long tradition in Russia, as public apathy.
But these days - the apathy is reinforced by improved living standards.
With the windfall of oil and gas, Russians live better than they have ever lived in communist times.
One can also argue that history has never seen such a proportion of Russians enjoying a decent standard of living.
As a result, people have become more docile with a government increasingly autocratic.
Of course, there are many reasons to complain, and people may grumble, but they will not come together to oppose the status quo.
Marginal political groups and figures who stage protests increasingly find themselves confronting official pressure and even harassment, which is new reasons for the general public turns its back on them.
As the election result is a foregone conclusion, it may be that many will simply not vote.
In fact, Russia today has virtually no reason to muster active support.
On the contrary, public participation is seen as an obstacle to the goals pursued by the bureaucracy: self-perpetuation and expanding control over lucrative assets.
If members of the Russian elite ever nursed modernizing ambitions, they have abandoned them, for without public participation, modernization is a fallacy.
Instead, the Kremlin is relying more and more on the conservative electorate, Soviet-style, as his power base, while alienating the advanced, entrepreneurs and better trained.
Stephen Jennings, president of the board of Renaissance Capital, an investment group with a decade of experience in Russia, recently noted the "contradictory trends" of the country: the emergence of a "burgeoning middle class" in alongside a "highly centralized government, breeding a new class of state oligarchs and bureaucracy to the rapid growth."
The problem is that the best and brightest Russian elements, which Jennings praised for "high management skills, professionalism, productivity and social and economic ambition," do not seem to consider their interests distance from the political decision-making.
They may resent the Kremlin's economic policies, but they put up with the rampant corruption of Russia and its disgraceful ratings in competitiveness indices, just as they put up with the general erosion of democracy, manipulation the judicial system and weak law enforcement.
Like their less advanced compatriots, they do not seek to hold the government accountable or call for change.
For now, life is good enough as it is.
Therefore, if a smooth transition in 2008 is threatened, or if there is a risk of destabilization, its origin can be found only in infighting at the top, not the public.
Optimists hope that one day the Russian middle class growth will take responsibility for the future of Russia and demand a radical improvement in the way of governing.
But what - what would trigger a shift from passive compliance to active public participation?
If good times breed political apathy, and bad policies lead to a socioeconomic decline, Russia's best and brightest may find themselves outstripped by populist forces.
Fight against drugs: we must change strategy.
Once again, Russia and Ukraine are victims of an illusion.
Since the end of communism in 1991, the use of prohibited drugs has increased dramatically in these two countries (as well as many others).
They have responded with draconian measures in line with the simplistic policy of total elimination of drugs adopted by the UN.
These measures are now contributing to the AIDS explosion in the number of developing countries.
UN conventions governing the fight against drugs policy at international level does not take into account the recent findings on drug use and dependence.
Most of these agreements were established well before the onset of AIDS is spread primarily through the use of intravenous drugs in the countries of the ex - Soviet Union and in many Asian countries.
Thus, at the international level, it is in Russia and Ukraine that AIDS is spreading the fastest.
The number of people infected has increased to 18 during the past five years.
An estimated one and a half million Russians and 400,000 Ukrainians are affected and 85% of them are intravenous drug users.
In a misguided attempt to comply with UN conventions, the Russian and Ukrainian governments use most of their means of struggle against drugs repression.
Drug users are victims of ill-treatment by the police and were turned down by the health services, even for vital care.
Meanwhile, drugs continue to flood the market.
In drug, repression has never succeeded in eliminating demand.
Repression takes into account either the economic and social factors, neither the public health concerns related to the use of banned substances.
Locking up drug users is not a solution; in Russia it is even easier to buy drugs in prison than outside.
In a repressive climate, drug users who escape arrest tend to be subject to discrimination, which does not encourage them to protect their health or that of those around them.
If the company offers no hope for addicts and shown no compassion for them, substance abuse and the AIDS virus can only develop rapidly.
Russia and Ukraine are not the only ones to cope with the increase in intravenous drug use and the spread of AIDS that accompanies it.
If they continue this type of policy, Pakistan, Iran, China, Central Asian countries and all the countries that are in the same situation will face the same disaster in terms of public health.
Numerous studies worldwide show that in the fight against drugs, the action in the field of public health is the most effective way to reverse the HIV infection and reduce expenditure.
The British medical journal Lancet estimated that the US would have saved at least $ 500 million if they had set up a needle exchange program at the national level during the period 1987-1995.
A survey conducted at international level shows that HIV infection decreased from 5.8% in cities where there is a needle exchange program, but it increased by 5.9% in cities where there is none.
No studies of importance only showed a correlation between the existence of a needle exchange program and an increase in drug abuse.
Studies undertaken in the USA, Australia, and elsewhere show that if the number of addicts who receive treatment does not decrease, it is because the participants in needle exchange programs will have easier access.
UN agencies such as the Commission on Drugs and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC, ex - UNDCP) have no mandate to prescribe a specific fight against drugs strategy.
Nevertheless, their narrow conception of the fight against drugs has a strong influence on politics and the measures taken by states - members.
Many governments, obsessed with compliance with UN conventions, can not or do not want to take into account the negative effects in terms of public health of a strictly repressive policy against drugs.
In the 1990s, when AIDS began killing millions of people in Africa, infecting more than a quarter of the population of some countries, international institutions have turned away.
For similar reasons, this terrible epidemic is about to hit, among other countries of the ex - Soviet Union.
Have - we learned nothing?
It is not too late, policymakers at national and international level may still reconsider their strategy.
Despite the UN conventions, some countries have adopted a more pragmatic attitude towards drugs and AIDS.
Consider that it is primarily a public health issue helps fight much more effectively the AIDS epidemic.
The following measures would achieve it.
¬∑ Adopt anti - discrimination legislation to guarantee civil liberties and human rights of drug users and people living with HIV.
¬∑ Recognize that drug use is a public health problem and not of law enforcement or law enforcement and implement a policy that reflects this fact.
¬∑ Explicitly legalize needle exchange programs and methadone treatment and other alternatives.
¬∑ Establish national risk reduction programs that are pragmatic and accessible to all. This requires education, alternative therapies, detoxification programs and needle exchanges.
¬∑ Both nationally and internationally, to involve drug users and their advocates in the development of drug policy.
Refuse to reconsider the goals of the anti - drug and chosen strategies will only worsen the AIDS epidemic and contribute to the death of millions of vulnerable people.
Abandonment of the resolutions of Lisbon.
Upon taking office as President of the European Commission, Dur√£o Barroso - former Prime Minister of Portugal - will have to spend urgently reorganize and refocus economic policies of the European Union.
The thickest file that awaits is the resolutions of Lisbon, an ambitious program approved in 2000 by the Heads of State and Government of the European Union in order to make the EU "the the economy most competitive and dynamic "in 2010.
The main economic fields are covered: innovation and entrepreneurship, reform of social systems and social inclusion, skills and employment, gender equality at work, market liberalization of employment and property and sustainable development.
Certainly these are brave ambitions but which inherently belong to the sphere of national political decisions.
According to the European Treaties, the EU has no competence to establish a legislative and political arsenal in these areas, nor the power to enforce it.
However, the Council of Europe, encouraged by the European Commission, invented a new policy approach - called "open coordination" - in order to affect these areas.
Open coordination involves the determination of common goals at the EU, voluntary compliance by the Member States and internal control results in the Council of Europe.
Obviously, open coordination failed to keep its promises.
In addition, the illusion that the Council of Europe can somehow summon the growth and productivity has provided a diversion to national politicians who do not want to promote nationally unpopular decisions.
Thus, I suggest that Mr Barroso, at first, to get rid of the Lisbon agenda.
This is the only thing to do to make clear that national responsibilities remain in the hands of national politicians in economic performance.
This brings me to macroeconomic coordination in the European Union.
The Maastricht Treaty envisaged a simplified policy framework for monetary and economic union.
Monetary policy was centralized and entrusted to an independent central bank, while fiscal policy remains the responsibility of Member States.
National governments were subject to two constraints - depending on the excessive deficit procedure control - to prevent fiscal deficits above 3% of GDP and budget deficits of more than 60% of GDP (or at least around this value).
Thereafter, the Stability and Growth Pact added an additional criterion in the medium term, to ensure that national budgets are "almost balanced".
This was intended mainly to prevent irresponsible budgetary policies after the launch of the euro, while leaving sufficient room for cyclical oscillations of the deficit within the limit of 3%.
The credibility of this set of measures was greatly undermined by the November 2003 public controversy between the Commission and the Council of Ecofin on the implementation of the control procedure excessive budget deficits in France and Germany.
That does not mean it should be abandoned.
Instead, a common external constraint on fiscal behavior is needed as a guard - crazy together against an accumulation of unsustainable public debt, which could affect financial stability and inflation throughout the EU - an increased risk the impact of aging populations on pension systems.
Such a constraint also provides an anchor conducive to national decision-making in the Member States whose political systems are less reinforced.
But the system needs to be reviewed.
I do not listen to those who advocate excluding investment tax losses: this only provide further encouragement for creative accounting and unsustainable accumulation of debt.
Instead, we must focus on the sustainability of debt rather than annual deficits.
The criterion of debt, for example, could be accompanied by a limitation on (trends) growth rate of public expenditure, which would be kept below the rate of nominal GDP.
The Commission's power to initiate movement when there is risk of excessive deficits should be strengthened - as, of course, the Commission will never forget that monitoring of national policies is a task that requires a certain political sense and can not be left in the hands of managers and lawyers.
Finally, we must make European integration the main priority for the Union has at its disposal a powerful legal instrument to force open markets and strengthen competition.
The best therapy to stimulate growth must be both direct, by increasing competitive pressure, and indirect, by triggering the measures necessary for the adaptation of national employment policy, social protection and education.
This is where long-term effort.
State subsidies for enterprises in decline remain ambiguous and common laws designed to ensure the free movement of goods and services are not fully respected by Member States - public and energy markets are the best examples.
In addition, most service contracts - trade in securities, wholesale and retail distribution, business services, and local utilities - remain sheltered from competition and regulation free - trade.
The evidence is there to show that these market distortions services accounting for two-thirds of GDP are responsible for most of the productivity gap suffered by the EU vis - a - vis States - united.
In recent years, the Council of Europe has not devoted sufficient attention to these tasks, which involve a total and constant commitment by Member States to transpose and implement European directives.
All too often, the Commission has encouraged the development of new legislation and creating new spending programs rather than effective management of what is already in place.
So Barroso should forget the high-flying platitudes of the Lisbon agenda and focus instead on the effective implementation of the single market and put order in fiscal policies of the Member States.
You have to let local governments take responsibility for the economic performance of their country.
The emotional clash of civilizations.
Throughout the so - called "war against terrorism", the notion of "clash of civilizations" between Islam and the West has usually been excluded as politically incorrect and intellectually obtuse.
The most common interpretation instead is that the world has entered a new era characterized by conflict "within" a particular civilization, that is - to - say Islam, with fundamentalist Muslims as much at war against moderates as against the West.
Strategic conclusions derived from such an analysis was clear, ambitious and easily summarized: democratization.
If the absence of democracy in the Islamic world was the problem, bringing democracy to the "Greater" Middle - East would be the solution, and it was the historical duty of states - the US, as the most powerful and moral nation, to make this change necessary.
The status quo was untenable.
Putting democracy in place, with or without regime change, was the only alternative to chaos and the rise of fundamentalism.
Today, Iraq may - be on the verge of civil war between Shiites and Sunnis.
Iran, ruled by a new and more radical president is moving irresistibly toward obtaining a nuclear capability.
A free electoral process brought Hamas to power in Palestine, and the unfortunate episode of the Danish newspapers cartoons illustrated the almost combustible nature of relations between Islam and the West.
These developments open the way to new interpretations.
Rather than a "clash of civilizations", we might be faced with many levels of conflict, which interact with each other so that they increase global instability.
Indeed, it appears that the world is witnessing a triple conflict.
There is a divide within Islam, which, if the violence in Iraq spreads to neighboring countries, risks causing regional destabilization.
There is also a shock should not be considered between Islam and the West, but between the secular world and a growing religious world.
At a deeper level, more atavistic, there is an emotional conflict between a culture of fear and a culture of humiliation.
It would be a gross oversimplification to mention, as some do, a clash between civilization and barbarism.
In reality we are faced with a gap that is widening the role of religion, which runs between the West (with States - States in the role of the complicated exception) and most the rest of the world (the most notable exception being China), especially the Islamic world.
The divide reflects how religion defines an individual's identity within a society.
At a time when religion is becoming increasingly important elsewhere, we Europeans have largely forgotten our religious past (violent and intolerant) and have difficulty understanding the role that religion can play in the daily lives of others .
In some respects, "they" are our own buried past and, to a combination of ignorance, prejudice and above - all, fear, "we" are afraid that "they" could define our future.
We live in a secular world, where free speech can easily turn into insensitive and irresponsible mockery, while others see religion as their supreme goal, if not their last hope.
They tried everything, from nationalism to regionalism, from communism to capitalism.
Since everything has failed, why not try God?
Globalization can not - be not created these levels of conflict, but it accentuated them by making the differences more visible and palpable.
In our globalized age, we have lost the privilege, and paradoxically, the virtue, of ignorance.
We all see how others feel and react, but without the historical and cultural core instruments necessary to decipher those reactions.
Globalization has made the bed of a world dominated by the dictatorship of emotions and ignorance.
The emotional shock is exacerbated in the case of Islam.
In the Arab world, in particular, Islam is dominated by a culture of humiliation felt by the people and nations that consider themselves the main losers, the worst victims, of a new and unjust international system.
From this point of view, the Israeli - Palestinian conflict is exemplary.
It became an obsession.
This is not so much that Arabs and Muslims really care about the Palestinians.
On the contrary, the Islamic world left the Palestinians without real support for decades.
In reality, for them the conflict has come to symbolize the anachronistic perpetuation of an unfair colonial order, to represent their political malaise, and to embody the impossibility they perceive to become masters of their destiny.
In the eyes of the Arabs (and some other Muslims), the strength and resilience of Israel is a direct consequence of their own weakness, divisions and their corruption.
The majority of Arabs may not support al - Qaida, but they are not opposed with all their heart.
Instead, there is the temptation to regard Osama bin Laden as a type of violent Robin Wood, whose actions, unforgivable officially, have helped them to recover a sense of Arab pride and dignity.
This, may - be, what the real clash of civilizations: the emotional conflict between the European culture of fear and the culture of Muslim humiliation, especially Arabic.
It would be dangerous sub - estimate the depth of such a large emotional divide, and to recognize its existence is the first step to overcome it.
But it will be difficult, as transcending the emotional clash of civilizations presupposes an opening to the "other" that neither side is can - be willing to consider.
Globalization and anti - Americanism.
The anti - American sentiments are rising around the world.
American Democrats say that President Bush's policies have squandered America's attractiveness.
Republicans reply that America is bound to be resented because of its size and its association with globalization.
According to them, the anti - Americanism will persist because some people see America as a cultural threat.
Personally, I think these views lack historical perspective.
Contrary to conventional wisdom, globalization is not a factor of homogenization and Americanization of world cultures.
Although the United - States are at the forefront of the current information revolution, which allows the development of similarities in cultural and social behavior (such as television viewing or Internet use) that are attributed to the Americanization, although the correlation is not causation.
To understand why, imagine a country that introduced computers and communications at speed in a world where America would not exist.
One would expect still to cultural and social changes of importance because of such modernization.
Of course, because of the existence of the United - States and their presence at the cutting - edge of the information revolution, there is a degree of Americanization, which will likely decrease during the twenty-first century thanks to the technology spreads and local cultures modernize in their own time.
Historical proof that globalization does not necessarily mean homogenization is in Japan, a country that deliberately isolated from the rest of the world during the first waves of globalization.
In the mid - nineteenth century, Japan became the first Asian country to embrace globalization, and to borrow successfully from the world without losing its uniqueness.
During the Meiji Restoration, Japan searched broadly for tools and innovations that would allow it to become a leading power rather than a victim of Western imperialism.
He sent young people to study in Western societies.
Its delegations around the world in search of scientific innovation, technology and industry.
In the political realm, Meiji reformers were well aware of the philosophy and American institutions, yet they chose to turn to the German model they found more appropriate to a country ruled by an emperor.
The lesson that Japan teaches the rest of the world not only is that an Asian country can compete, but that after a century and a half of globalization, it is possible to adapt while preserving a unique culture.
Above all, the image of a homogenizing America reflects a mistakenly factor static view of culture.
Efforts to portray local cultures as unchanging often reflect reactionary political strategies rather than descriptions of reality.
In the words of the Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa, those who defend cultural identities against globalization betray a stagnant attitude towards culture not borne out by historical component.
Have - we know of any cultures that have remained unchanged through time?
To find any of them, go to the small, primitive, magico - religious, populated by people who ... because of their primitive condition, become progressively more vulnerable to exploitation and extermination.
Vibrant cultures are constantly changing and borrowing from other cultures and that borrowing is not always from the United - States.
Thus, many countries turned to Canada than the United - States as an example to their own constitution in the years following the end of the Cold War.
Globalization is also a double-edged sword.
In some areas, not only the backlash is felt against American cultural imports, but an effort is also made to change American culture itself - even.
A majority of Americans probably agree with the death penalty today, but the death penalty is considered a gross violation of human rights throughout Europe, in fact, almost anywhere in the world.
US positions on the environment and climate change or GMOs bring similar criticism.
More subtly, America's openness to immigration as well enriches and changes American culture.
Finally, globalization and the information revolution may reinforce rather than reduce cultural diversity.
Some French commentators express fear that in a world of global Internet marketing that would leave no room for a culture that cherishes hundreds of different varieties of cheese.
On the contrary, the Internet allows dispersed customers to come together in order to encourage niche markets, and even hundreds of websites devoted exclusively to cheese.
The Internet also allows people to establish more diverse set of political communities.
The use of Welsh in Great - Britain and Gaelic in Ireland is greater today than it was there half - century.
Great - Britain, Belgium and Spain, among other European countries have granted greater powers to regional and local representatives.
The global information age may strengthen rather than weaken local cultures.
Economic and social globalization does produce superficial similarities in T logos - shirt or soft drink brands, but there will always be a great cultural diversity under - lying.
American culture is now prominent, and it contributes to America's attractiveness, this is its soft power in many areas but not in all areas.
At the same time, immigrants, ideas, and events outside America's borders are changing American culture within the borders of the United - States.
As globalization spreads technical capabilities, information technology allows broader participation in global communications and the domination of the economy and American culture could very well weaken.
Less dominance may mean a little less anxiety vis - a - vis the Americanization, fewer protests against American arrogance, and less intensity in the backlash of anti - Americanism.
The United - States may have - less control in the future, but could be living in a world more compatible with the fundamental principles of democracy, free enterprise, individual freedoms and human rights.
Why America should join the world.
The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 on New York and Washington have changed States - United by moving the order of priorities on foreign policy.
The new national security strategy of the Bush administration, prepared in September 2002 identifies the combination of terrorism, rogue states and weapons of mass destruction as the primary threat to America.
Most citizens agree with the new direction taken by US foreign policy, but disputed the method used.
The threat is - it so great that America must act alone or the United - States must - they act only with the support of international institutions, even if it is stifling the country?
Events in Iraq illustrate this debate, but it is rooted in deeper causes.
During his presidential campaign in 2000, George W. Bush said of America: "If we're an arrogant nation, they will consider us as well, but if we're a humble nation, they will respect us."
He was right, but unfortunately too many of America's friends saw his administration in the first eight months after his election, worrying arrogantly limited American interests, focused on military power and despised case of treaties, standards and multilateralism.
The announcement peremptory Administration stating that the Kyoto Protocol on global climate change was "dead" led to a reaction from other countries that cost the United - States based in the Human Rights Commission the UN.
September 11 so - called changed all that.
Congress has finally paid off debts owed by America to the United Nations and the President has focused on building a coalition against terrorism.
But the rapid success of the war in Afghanistan has led some members of the administration and some commentators to conclude the functioning of unilateralism. Columnist Charles Krauthammer, for example, advocates a "new unilateralism" where America refuses to play the role of "docile international citizen" and pursues its own objectives without scruple.
New unilateralist make a mistake by focusing too heavily on military power alone.
It is true that the military might of America, supported by a budget equivalent to that combination of the eight most powerful countries after the United - States, is essential to global stability and plays a major role in the response to terrorism.
But the metaphor of war should not blind us to the fact that the suppression of terrorism will take years of patient unspectacular civilian cooperation with other countries in areas such as information sharing, police work the traceability financial flows and cooperation between customs.
The military success in Afghanistan has solved the simplest part of the problem.
Al Qaeda retains cells in fifteen countries.
Rather than show the view unilateralist, partial success in Afghanistan illustrates the continuing need for cooperation.
Similarly, it was much easier to win the war in Iraq than to win the peace.
The problem for Americans in the 21st century lies in the fact that a larger number than ever of problems and forces beyond the control of even the most powerful state. The attacks of September 11 demonstrated that the revolution and globalization of information have changed world politics so that Americans can not achieve all their international goals by acting alone.
The United - States lack the international and domestic prerequisites to solve own conflicts with other companies and to monitor and control transnational transactions that threaten Americans in their country.
In several of the current major issues, such as international financial stability, drug smuggling, the spread of disease or global climate change, military power is ineffective.
Indeed, his appeal may go against the purpose.
America must instead mobilize international coalitions to address these threats and common challenges.
The will of cooperation from other countries depends in part on their own self-interest but also the attractiveness of American positions.
This attraction is what I call the "soft power".
This means that other countries want what you want and the need to use the carrot and the stick to get others to do what you want is less present.
Hard power stems from military and economic power of a country.
Soft power is the product of the attraction represented by the culture, the ideals and policies of a country.
Hard power will always be important, but soft power will become more and more important in the treatment of transnational issues whose resolution requires multilateral cooperation.
Certainly no great country can not afford to be purely multilateralist and the United - States may have to take the lead of other countries, as was the case in Afghanistan.
But in Iraq, President Bush should have followed the example of his father and build a broad international coalition.
Now, as his administration returns to the UN to seek a new resolution that will allow other countries to contribute troops and resources for peacekeeping and reconstruction in Iraq, he pays the price of its method of entry into the war.
Granted, multilateralism can be used by smaller states to restrict the freedom of action of America, but that does not mean it does not, as a rule, in the interest of the America.
By integrating the US policies in multilateral structures, states - the US can make their disproportionate power more legitimate and acceptable.
Even well intentioned Americans are not immune against the famous warning that Lord Acton said that power tends to corrupt.
Learning to listen to others and to define US interests more broadly to include global interests will be crucial for the American soft power, and the vision qu'auront other countries of their preponderance (beneficial or not).
The paradox of American power is that the most important power since Rome can not achieve many of its objectives unilaterally in a global information age.
America should pay more attention to soft power and multilateral cooperation.
This is the real lesson of September 11th.
Socialism or global division?
For the first time in our history, we have the knowledge, technology and wealth required to design a different world.
We have the means to "make poverty in the dustbin of history" (Make Poverty History).
Although we have the power to change the world, we do not take the necessary measures.
In 2000, many governments around the world have adopted under the auspices of the UN Millennium Development Goals, which aim to halve poverty by 2015.
The international community does not show the political will needed to meet these basic responsibilities to humanity, causing a loss of confidence in politics in populations.
If we do not, our citizens will lose hope in the power of democracy and take refuge in extremism, fundamentalism and violence.
To restore confidence not only in politics but also in people their own potential, our policies must guarantee responsible governance and institutions working responsibly in the interest of citizens.
The Socialist International, the largest political organization in the world, may, therefore, unite the world's citizens around a new global program to achieve these goals.
Our first challenge is to democratize globalization.
We must redefine globalization from below and include two-thirds of humanity who are currently excluded from the process, in terms that reflect the socialist principles of inclusion, cultural diversity and sustainable development.
How - citizens in a democratic way is to participate in economic development when the IMF and World Bank are working on the principle of "one dollar, one vote"?
Democracy can not truly flourish in a world where capital and power are overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few - some, when multinationals challenge the power of democratically elected representatives, when organized crime can afford buy police, justice and politicians when monopolization of the media erodes fundamental freedoms.
Democratizing globalization will take time.
However, we can accelerate the process by strengthening regional cooperation and integration.
This calls for the creation of new channels of cooperation with progressive forces in other parts of the world, China, the United - States, India and the Arab world.
To meet global challenges, we must strengthen and democratize international institutions including the United Nations.
But we must go beyond the reform of the Security Council and start creating a democratic global architecture to make globalization at the service of citizens, not markets.
Today, the top priority for socialists is to restore the balance between economic productivity and social justice.
While we enjoy successful precedents, including the Nordic model, it remains difficult to achieve this balance for some countries.
Capitalist markets giving way to vast commercial networks and market economies turning into market societies, governments and unions are still being more restricted in their freedom of action.
This has paralyzed and divided our citizens.
Citizens of developed countries are feeling increasingly objectified by consumerism, while citizens of developing countries struggle daily to survive.
In both cases, but in different ways, people feel impoverished.
Surely we belong to different companies but we also have to deal with new forms of inequality.
Lack of labor standards in some areas of the world undermines the social well - being of workers in other parts of the world.
The migration of masses of poor countries has fueled feelings of fear and xenophobia in richer countries, especially in the working class.
Similarly, free trade has returned back to back farmers and employees of the tertiary sector in developed and developing countries.
The environmental issues have become the bed of the great blame game.
Developed countries fear the depletion of vital resources if they are shared with developing countries, which in turn accuse the rich countries to destroy the environment in their pursuit of profit.
To bridge these divisions, we must rethink the nature of employment in this global economy increasingly automated, open-plan and mobile.
Capital is globalizing, core labor standards must also be global.
Forced labor and child labor and discrimination in hiring, should be removed.
We also need to democratize our own policies.
We must fight against exclusion in our political parties as we fight exclusion in our societies.
This means welcoming migrants and minorities, creating greater opportunities for women and the disabled, to empower citizens through education and participation.
Empowering citizens means giving them the power to decide and the ability to make informed choices.
PASOK, the Greek Socialist party that I lead, we undertook ambitious reforms in this direction.
It is the same in the Socialist International that seeks to create a world governed not by free markets, but by free people.
The Chinese and Indian hare tortoise.
"India everywhere" was the theme of the World Economic Forum this year.
In the Western world, great importance is given to China's success so much as those of India come to mind after the fact.
To underscore the point that political stability must triumph in the long run, the Indians plastered Swiss buses with the banner "India, the fastest emerging democracy in the world.".
India media blitz was a monumental success.
In Davos, speaker after speaker touted the idea that even if China is ahead now, over the long run, the race between the two Asian giants is a toss.
At least for a few days, the emergence of India as a superpower on par with China, was a done deal.
But what - really in the race between the two economies with each more than a billion people?
On the surface, China has a comfortable lead over India.
There are twenty - five at the dawn of the current globalization movement, the Indian and Chinese domestic productions were approximately the same.
Now, regardless of the economic indicators, China is twice as rich as India.
But the real difference is not so much the fact that the best Chinese fare better than the best Indians.
The Indian elite champions. The bold offer of $ 22 billion proposed by Lakshmi Mittal to buy the French steelmaker Arcelor shows.
The real difference - whether we admit it or not - is that the Chinese Communist government has succeeded in globalizing a larger share of the population that the Indian democratic government has managed to do so.
However, it is impossible to say that wealth is evenly distributed in China.
It is only along the coast, home to roughly one-third of the Chinese population, people really seem to be back in the 21st century.
Much of rural China is still very poor and 150 million rural Chinese do not have jobs. In rural areas, health and education often recall the past centuries.
However, the numbers of exclusion due to the caste system in India are even worse.
It could be that only one in five integrated into the global economy.
For employees in call centers, it has countless Indians who only plod along.
While some 450 million Chinese are involved in the globalization of the economy, only 200 and 250 million Indians benefit.
More than anything else, it is this difference between the two economies.
What can India do to close this gap?
Its biggest shortcoming is the lack of roads, bridges, ports and other infrastructure. At this level, the contrast with China is striking.
If your products can not access the global market, how India could - it conquer?
Over the past five years, China has quintupled its road infrastructure.
Its 50,000 kilometers of new roads were built to accommodate larger aircraft, which is incommensurate with some airstrips Indian airports.
It is not a question of money: cash is flowing to the Indian central bank which primarily invest in foreign treasury bills with low yields.
The real problem is that China's authoritarian system faces little opposition when it decides to bulldoze a shantytown that stands in the way of a new airport.
The Indian government, however, has neither the power nor the will to trample over poor people to further enrich the rich.
Unfortunately, without infrastructure, the 800 million Indians who have not yet succeeded in life have little chance of achieving this.
India will never create enough jobs in services alone, it must be able to become competitive in the production of low-end products.
Without better infrastructure, the majority of Indians remain excluded from globalization.
Thus, the Indian economy could - she one day succeed to exceed the Chinese hopeless romanticism?
Not necessarily. The areas where India excels, notably services, offer potentially higher margins than manufacturing.
On this point, the Chinese, hampered by a vastly inferior legal system, will struggle to compete.
Western companies have more trust Indian firms with sensitive financial information or patents than they do in China.
Foreign companies know that if they outsource any high-tech process to China, they might as well publish their blueprints on the web.
India also has a much more developed financial system than China, an advantage that importance of growing gradually as the two countries develop.
Control and monitoring of Finance (directed lending, such as economists call it) works well when it comes to build bridges. They are much less so when it comes to choosing what companies deserve to survive.
The challenge for the Indians as with other emerging economies (Brazil, Russia and Mexico) is to find new ways to boost their economic sectors without strangling them.
If India is to ever catch up with China, it should include a greater number of citizens in globalization by providing better education, more efficient health facilities and a larger infrastructure network.
It is only at this price that "India everywhere."
G8 country of black gold.
Russia poor, so rich in oil.
She is trying so hard to find a place in the elite Group of Eight countries taken seriously.
President Vladimir Putin, who can hope - be raise the debate at the presidential summit in St. Petersburg in July, an ambitious agenda.
He plans to lead his colleagues in erudite conversations about education, infectious diseases, and to be sure that no one falls asleep, "energy security".
And Putin's efforts earned it - they?
Not much - much.
The Bush administration, led by Vice - President Dick Cheney (but with the explicit approval of the owner) recently accused Russia of backsliding into its old "evil empire."
Putin shot back, states - united "Comrade Wolf," ready to pounce on any nation showing signs of weakness.
How Bush and Putin will - they greet at the meeting in St. Petersburg? The suspense is over.
Europeans, meanwhile, are still at the edge of the nerves, so great is their fear of being trapped again in the gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine that dried their pipelines for a few days at the beginning of year.
For them, talking about "energy security" with Russia as akin to chatting about water safety with Comrade Crocodile.
Obviously, if we want to be mean we can always point out the absurdity of Russia's membership in a club that includes the giant economies of states - the United States, Germany, Japan, England, France , Italy and (to a lesser extent) Canada.
Why Chinese President Hu Jintao, whose country has the second largest economy (measured in world prices), did - it not instead awarded Putin at the table?
After all, even with all its energy resources, and despite the current high price of gas and oil, the domestic product of Russia is only about the size of Greater Los Angeles.
Can - Putin needs - we stop to collect all these criticisms and go on the offensive.
He could start by pointing to its democratic counterparts enough that he is probably more popular in Russia that none of them in his own country.
In fact, it could probably win an election tomorrow honestly (no risk he knows one day though).
Few leaders who might be said without laughing.
Obviously, the success of Putin recent years in eliminating anything that looks or indirectly to a free press (and when a former KGB "eliminates" the free press is not a figure of style) helped to silence any open opposition.
But this does not prevent Putin to enjoy a genuinely popular among a public longing for a leader able to secure the country without the flow.
Putin might also argue that the tax position of his country is much stronger than the other G8 members.
Certainly, the fact that Siberia has proved to be a giant oil well, with the government absorbs the bulk of revenues was very useful.
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is also trying to balance the books of account of his country, for now.
But to be fair, oil is not everything.
Most economists advocate rich countries to replace their old tax codes with a simple and low tax, single rate and bemoan the fact that so few countries have tried it.
Putin, however, has introduced this style of politics there a few years ago, and the results were nothing short of miraculous.
Of course, it is possible that other G8 leaders might be less enamored of some Russian practices in the resolution of budgetary problems.
Most G8 countries seem incapable of achieving the political consensus required to take the necessary measures, such as increasing the retirement age or significantly cutting the indexation of benefits to inflation.
Russia, it has essentially abandoned its pensioners after increasing the amount of their income.
In fact, many Russian elderly are forced to make their living from growing potatoes on the tiny plots of land that the government allows them to grow.
That is - to - say, if they survive: since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the life expectancy of men has fallen from 65 years to 60 years.
It seems that the stress of transition is the leading cause of death, even above big killers in postcommunist Russia - Communist like alcohol, crime and AIDS.
Putin must - he tell his colleagues that they too could balance the intergenerational behalf of their country by starving the elderly?
In fact, Putin would probably be well advised not to overstate the success of his country.
Can - be it - it better to let the vodka flow and hope round of smiles in the family photo.
Anyway, when Putin tells his guests that they must pay Russia more to improve their own "energy security," he may finally - be get the respect that he craves hard.
The Economics of fear.
The global economy seems to be walking on water, getting rid of a shrug of rising oil prices, policy paralysis in Europe, unsustainable deficit States - United and record property prices .
Would - that because, as would have us believe the G8 leaders, investors are optimistic, confident in the direction given to the world economy by their leaders?
Or are - we are governed by a pathology of fear, fed by events such as the recent terrorist attacks in London, which maintains the long-term interest rates at a low level, masking a range of underlying problems?
The role of long-term interest rates extremely low (adjusted for inflation), which hides a multitude of weaknesses in the global economy is all too apparent.
Rising real estate prices around the world supports the demand in many countries, and according to a recent study by the International Monetary Fund, interest rates continued decline explain two - thirds or more of the international rise prices.
Europe has benefited less, but its economies are far worse off if long-term interest rates returned to their average there 25 years.
Similarly, Latin America has a boom in recent years, despite the weight of debt and a mixed political reform.
The low long-term interest rates have allowed the region to manage its debt, while demand has helped push up prices of exported commodities in the region.
Why oil prices soaring it does not put the global economy to its knees, as was so often the case in the past?
Once again, the answer is low interest rates.
Usually, a sudden spike in oil prices quickly translates awaiting high inflation, followed by rising interest rates at all maturities.
This time - it yet the Fed continues to raise its short-term lending rates to control inflation and long-term interest rates, which are much more important, have declined, like magic.
Indeed, America is the single largest beneficiary of this situation of low interest rates, where everyone borrows money as if soon there would be more nowhere.
Homeowners, backed by rising property prices, accumulating debt.
The federal government has thrown out the entire fiscal prudence window.
The country as a whole absorbs an astounding three - quarters of global savings.
But as long as interest rates remain low and growth high, Americans can laugh at those who are forecasting that their excess plant the fruits of their ruin.
But if the low levels of long-term interest in helping so many economies walk on water, why are rates - they are so low and this situation it will last?
The situation may - be much more fragile than many politicians would have us believe.
People feel can - be less, not more, secure about their long-term future, either because they are concerned about terrorism, a global pandemic or a set of severe financial crises.
I'm not saying that investors are hysterical, just that they have become a little more worried about the long term prospects.
Therefore, they pounce on shares and debt securities they perceive, rightly or wrongly, as safe.
We lack other convincing explanations.
It is certain that emerging markets have embarked on an unusual savings, reforming their reserves and improving their fiscal balances, but nobody expects this to continue indefinitely.
Even the director of the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, the oracle of Delphi on interest rates, says of the current situation it is a "mystery."
History suggests that the technology boom has not completely finished playing his role, and with the US productivity gains ready to irradiate the world by raising growth rates everywhere.
Usually, rapid global growth translates into interest rates to rise in the long term, unless, of course, at the depths of self -, people have become worried.
Suppose investors are worried disaster possibilities within five to ten years.
(According to experts on nuclear terrorism and pandemics, the risk is real.).
Suppose investors believe that growth will likely continue to remain strong, but that may - be - just might - be - the situation d√©litera.
In this case, SetPoint quite possible the coexistence of low interest rates with strong growth.
True, some economists point to the halcyon days of the 1950s and early 1960s, when Europe, the United - States and Japan prospered, but interest rates generally remained well below the economic growth rate.
This time representing the golden age of global growth, why worry if we are seeing the same phenomenon today?
What the optimists forget is that these years paradisiacal also represented a period of great uncertainty.
There were many who feared actually triggering the Third World War, and rightly so according to many historians.
At that time - there, the Apocalypse spectrum allowed to keep loans at affordable rates.
Fortunately, the worst fears of investors do not come true, and we can now hope for the same.
But if insecurity is a major reason why the interest rates are low, while the G8 leaders should be less quick to commend.
The fragility of the collective investor psychology is well known.
If they settle down one day, interest rates will shoot up beautiful and this may well be latent imbalances in the global economy to a boil.
Political earthquake in Israel.
Israeli politics is undergoing the most impressive changes he has seen in 30 years.
The realignment of parties and leaders is particularly noteworthy given the unexpected nature of recent events dated: Ariel Sharon's decision to leave the Likud, Peres's defeat as leader of the Labour Party and the withdrawal of the Labour Sharon's grand coalition government.
It is all the more crucial to understand the significance of these changes for the future of Israel, the region and the Arab - Israeli conflict.
Schematically, the Israeli political system is approaching the end of its second era.
From independence in 1948 until 1977, the Labour Party has dominated before giving way to an opposition coalition of conservative, nationalist, and centrist parties allied in the Likud bloc.
Since then, the two parties have held power alternately, sometimes in large coalitions and sometimes in partnership with smaller parties.
On the surface, the rivalry between parties was played between "left" and "right" or "hawks" and "doves."
The truth, of course, is more complex.
Social class and economic problems, in the shadow of more persistent existential concerns, such as physical security and continuity of the state, played a much less important role in Israel than in other societies.
Here, the political divide could be defined as the clash of "optimists" and "pessimists".
The first, Labour, believed that some day a force would emerge among Arabs and Palestinians ready to make peace on reasonable grounds, while the latter, Likud, were more circumspect.
For years, the discussion remained an abstraction, a debate over what might happen in the future, until the Oslo agreement with the PLO in 1993 will put to the test the competing visions.
Since 2000, when the PLO leader Yasser Arafat rejected a political agreement and began instead a terrorist war five years, there is little optimistic.
The intellectual realignment which resulted in Israel has given rise to a new national consensus.
It is now widely accepted that, as the left has always stressed, Israel must be prepared to withdraw from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and accept a Palestinian state in exchange for real peace.
But it is also widely accepted that, as the right has always maintained, no partner is really ready to make peace.
In this context, Sharon won two landslide election victories as a radical while applying a moderate policy, including a full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.
That is where Israel today, facing a political upheaval fueled by two developments.
First, Sharon moved the Likud to the center, and made it the hegemonic party, while destroying every stereotype about his personality, methods, and worldview.
Yet it is for the same reason that many members of Likud view Sharon, who helped found the party, as a traitor.
Sharon now needs to institutionalize his reforms, even if it has to establish another party to do so.
Second, the Labour Party has demonstrated its political bankruptcy, since its only conceivable leader Shimon Peres was 82 years old and his optimism anachronistic Dove was ridiculed.
Accordingly, and with a low rate of participation in elections, the party's primary was won by Amir Peretz, outsider and populist who wants to revive the Labour Party in highlighting the social and economic problems, which means the withdrawal the national unity coalition with Likud.
While it should form a new party, Sharon will probably win the next election, he planned for February.
Peretz's strategy may draw - be electors other leftist parties, but Labor will most likely lose centrist voters (and those for whom national security is a priority) for the benefit of Sharon.
Ironically, all this will have immense significance in principle and can - be very modest in practice.
While Sharon has strong public support to exert moderate policy, Israel will be more ready than ever to reaching an agreement with the Palestinians, Syria and the Arab world in general in order to find a comprehensive diplomatic solution to the conflict.
Yet, given the chaos and paralysis that increasingly characterize Palestinian politics more, this opportunity will not be seized.
The growing power of Hamas, which openly proclaims its strategy of increasing terrorism and destroy Israel only strengthens this tendency.
We can say the same of Syria, whose radical government turns to a dangerously adventurous militancy.
Sharon might decide on partial withdrawals and dismantling of settlements in the West Bank.
But it is now widely recognized that such changes are a response to a gloomy outlook for real progress towards peace.
Hold on to the territories to make the issues of bargaining has much less sense if there is nobody to haggle.
Israel rather continue to give priority to its own security, strengthening its defenses against terrorism and consolidating control over the relatively small portions of the West Bank that it intends to claim as its share of any diplomatic agreement.
Secondary consequence of this strategy, combined with Palestinian attacks, international sympathy has grown in relation to Israel.
This could continue if the current political realignment is sustained, enabling Sharon to win its program the center and even moderate left.
Nothing is assured, of course.
Benjamin Netanyahu, who remains popular, may well become a powerful rival on his right, and Peretz may well make the Labour Party a serious contender on his left.
Nevertheless, the national consensus has changed sides, by undermining all beliefs on Israeli policies.
The February elections will submit these certainties to their severest test in decades.
The agreement on changes in the global climate has helped science.
Securing the Future at the Evian Summit.
The paradox of our times is that the richest countries in the world have the power to do good, but they seem to feel compelled to miss all the opportunities available to them in that direction.
The United - States constitute the typical example par excellence: a country that spends $ 450 billion a year to its defense budget and allocates only $ 12 billion a year in development aid for poor countries.
They can bomb Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq, but they seem ill-equipped to help these regions to develop.
Europe is not in a better position, as it is paralyzed by internal divisions and budget deficits.
At the G8 summit, to be held next week in Evian, France will have a chance to make a fresh start.
For the billion people is represented at the G8 Summit, life proceeds relatively nicely with the rest of the world, with average income of 25,000 dollars per person a life expectancy of around 80 years.
For about three billion people in the world today, including China, much of India and East Asia, economic development goes relatively well, even if it displays a many ups and downs (lately, the shock of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome).
Economic trends are emerging in Brazil and Mexico.
But for the remaining two billion, life is hopeless.
For about a billion of them, their survival is precarious.
Millions of people die each year for lack of access to medicines, food, safe drinking water and basic sanitation.
Their life expectancy is often less than 50 years and fall in many regions.
The G - 8 could end the suffering of billions of the world's poorest people if it adopted realistic measures to solve their problems.
He does not do it because it is not only greedy but also fearful.
He thinks that global poverty is inevitable and too expensive to eradicate.
But it can solve the problems of the poorest individuals, compared with less effort and without significant negative impact on their own standard of living.
The biggest problem areas are concentrated in Black Africa, in the Andean region and Central Asia.
Other pockets of extreme poverty in China and India are on the path to improvement through the rapid economic growth of these two giants.
But the problems in Black Africa, the Andes and Central Asia are not solved them - selves.
These regions are trapped in poverty.
Africa is by far the most affected.
The US government believes that these countries can not only blame them - even if they are poor.
But this is the ignorant boasting of a rich country that does not understand the situation on the ground.
Africa is trapped in poverty for deep-seated reasons.
She suffers from endemic malaria, which looks like an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome that would last for centuries, and not for a few months.
It suffers from a climate prone to massive droughts and soils nutrients are depleted.
It suffers from the fact that most of the population lives in rural areas without paved streets to reach the ports and to facilitate access to international trade.
Except for a few countries in West Africa, it suffers from a serious shortage of energy resources (coal, oil and hydroelectric power).
The United - States have never been struggling with problems of the magnitude of those imposed Africa.
Ultimate irony, these serious problems can be solved, whatever the cost.
It is at this level that the G8 must intervene.
The only commitment to be taken by G8 leaders in Evian is to follow through on their previous promises that were not kept for years.
Over the past three years, world leaders pledged to take concrete steps to reduce global poverty by half by the year 2015, in a series of commitments known as the Millennium Development Goals.
But only small steps have been taken.
The United - States have increased by 4 billion a year while they have also increased their military spending by $ 150 billion a year and cut taxes by trillions of dollars.
It is obvious that the United - States have the means to undertake more very large scale to help the poor countries of the world, if only they anticipated.
G8 leaders must commit to specifically provide financial assistance tailored to the Global Fund against AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, increasing food productivity in Africa through a new Green Revolution, to ensure that all poor children can attend school and that all poor people in all countries have access to safe drinking water and sanitation.
The total cost of this problem is remarkably less than 1% of the annual income of rich countries.
For the first time in history, the rich are so rich and the poor so poor a tiny effort by the rich could end a huge pain.
The Evian Summit clarify the situation and reveal whether greed, ignorance, and the bombast of war have completely closed the eyes of the United - States and whether Europe and Japan will look self - rather than outwardly.
Good reasons to slow population growth.
Global discussions on population policy are confusing.
On the one hand, it is argued that the growth of human populations threaten our environment and prosperity.
Land, water, energy and biodiversity all seem to suffer more stress than ever, and population growth appears to be largely responsible.
On the other, debate, mainly in rich countries, focuses on households and the small number of children they have, enough to take care of their aging parents.
Those concerned about population growth have the better arguments.
The questions to Europe, Japan and to a lesser extent the United - States and some middle-income countries, face in terms of aging population are manageable.
In addition, the benefits of slower population growth outweigh the adjustment costs.
By cons, if global populations continue to grow rapidly, pressure on the world's resources will increase.
Governments should therefore refrain from implementing natalist policies, even where birth rates are low.
The confusion of the public debate partly reflects different population trends in different world regions.
The fastest population growth occurs in the poorest regions.
Poor people, especially agricultural populations tend to have more children (often up to six per woman) and thereby experiencing the highest population growth rates.
The poor farming families rely on their children for farm chores and family's safety when they are old.
Poor families lack access to contraception and family planning.
Finally, poor families have many children as to ensure against high infant mortality.
Because of the very high birth rates in Africa, the UN Population Division expects the doubling of the African population for 2050, passing from 900 million today to 1.8 billion.
People with rapid population growth are also young populations because of the large number of children per household.
In Africa, the average age is now only 19 years and is projected to rise to around 28 years in 2050.
In Europe, the trends are reversed.
The United Nations predicts a decline in the population will fall to about 630 million in 2050, against 725 million today.
With fewer children and longer life expectancy, the average age of the population rises sharply in this forecast and spent 39 years in 2005 to 48 in 2050.
For the world as a whole, the population is expected to continue to grow by 2.5 billion between 2005 and 2050.
All of this growth will be in the developing world: 1.3 billion more in Asia, 900 million more in Africa, and the rest in Latin America and other regions.
Increasing global population of 2.5 billion people will not only increase the pressure on companies where population growth occurs but also on the whole planet.
The overall energy consumption takes off, reflecting the combined effect of the increase in per capita income (and thus increasing the energy consumption per capita) and the population.
The high energy consumption is already changing our climate in dangerous ways.
In addition, the tensions created by global population growth combined with income growth leading to rapid deforestation, depletion of fisheries, land degradation and loss of natural habitat and extinction for a Many plant and animal species.
Population growth in developing regions, particularly in Africa, India and other parts of Asia, must slow.
Public policies can play an important role in improving access to family planning services for the poor, expanding social systems supported, reducing child mortality through investment in public health and improving the education and access to employment for women.
Part of the European public, noting the decline of European populations threatening, wants to take against - establish and promote a return to larger families.
It would be a mistake.
Advocates of rapid population growth in Europe are concerned about the lack of young labor for public pensions.
But this anxiety can be managed now by higher savings from the young and middle-aged people preparing for retirement and by working - beyond the age of 65.
These workers will benefit from the biggest advantages if they live in societies with stable or slightly declining.
Their direct household expenditures related to children's education will obviously be less important.
They will also save on investments related to infrastructure such as new roads, power plants, schools and other public services.
They also benefit from less congested cities and less pressure on the environment in the country.
European economies have less costs to support the limitation of greenhouse gases due to energy consumption, which will lead to more effective control of climate change.
In short, the quality of life will improve with the decline of the European population in the coming years.
There is nothing radical here to call for slowing population growth.
For tens of thousands of years, the human population tended to rise and fall without really demonstrate a definite trend in the long term.
It is only in recent centuries with the rise of modern economic life that the world population took off, from one billion people in about 1820-6300000000 today and 9 billion projected 2050.
This explosive growth was made possible thanks to the huge advances in science and technology.
But this unprecedented growth has also put a strain on our planet.
We should intensify our efforts to slow population growth voluntarily and we should recognize that the stabilization of the world population now bring more to human happiness and strengthen environmental sustainability for the future.
Foreign investors - they still welcome?
The global foreign direct investment (FDI) have soared over the past two years, from $ 40 billion in the early 1980s to $ 900 billion last year.
The cumulative stock of FDI has reached close to $ 10 trillion, making it the most important mechanism for delivery of goods and services to foreign markets: sales by foreign subsidiaries amounted to roughly 19 billion dollars, compared to world exports of $ 11 trillion.
At the same time, the liberalization of FDI regimes by virtually all countries is a major force for commerce between businesses, the lifeblood of the emerging system of integrated international production and already around one-third of world trade.
But this time is beautiful - it currently coming to an end?
If FDI can bring many benefits, it also can have costs.
In the 1970s when the transnational corporations (TNCs) undertaking such investment began to get noticed, many governments believed that the costs of FDI outweighed their benefits and so they controlled.
The pendulum, given by developed countries, began to stir in the 1980s.
Once considered part of the problem, FDI became part of the solution to economic growth and development.
Nothing illustrates this better than changes in national FDI regimes.
As reported by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, among the 2,156 changes that took place between 1991 and 2004, 93% were aimed at creating a more hospitable environment for TNCs.
But the risk that the pendulum is beginning to turn upside is real, leading to a decline in the liberalization process.
FDI in developed countries (and increasingly in emerging markets) often takes the form of border mergers and acquisitions.
Resistance to such processes becoming more frequent when they involve companies that politicians regard as "national champions" or play a role in national security, economic development or cultural identity.
The growing involvement of capital companies - investment in M ‚Äã‚Äã& A activity implies additional controversy, as such transactions are typically regarded as purely speculative.
In the name of "economic patriotism", security and other considerations, resistance to M & A codified in an increasing number of countries.
For example, a committee of the US Senate recently tried to block the planned liberalization of foreign takeover rules for airlines, and Europe has implemented more restrictive takeover laws.
Moreover, governments are applying more strictly existing regulatory provisions concerning the vetting of takeovers by foreign companies.
This response is intertwined with a defensive reaction to the growing role of TNCs from emerging markets, the "little news."
TNCs already well established, and their country of origin, will have to adapt to this new constellation of forces and its implications for the global market.
Like other contexts we have learned, it is not easy to adapt to newcomers: compare, for example, the reaction to the reconciliation between French Alcatel and US Lucent offers by China National Offshore Oil Corporation for Chevron or that of Mittal Acelor.
Another type of defensive reaction, this time to outward FDI may well arise once the offshoring of services gathers more speed.
All indications are that offshoring has reached a threshold and that this will accelerate through FDI.
If the country does not implement adjustment mechanisms to adapt to the rapid revolution that makes tradable service sector jobs, a backlash against such outward FDI will be inevitable.
The growing unease with FDI is so far largely confined to developed countries.
But there are signs that it is spreading to emerging markets.
In the case of large-scale projects, some host countries are raising questions about the contracts that define their relationship with TNCs, and governments are reviewing such contracts because they believe (rightly or wrongly) that they have no have a fair market.
Of the 219 known international arbitration cases concerning investment projects, some two-thirds were initiated during the past three years.
FDI approaches have changed in the past, and they can change again in the future, depending on how governments view the balance of costs and benefits.
This balance involves not only economic, but also considerations such as security and the desire to control the economic development of a country.
The concept of "nationalization of the century", introduced by Peruvian presidential candidate Ollanta Humala, reflects the "economic patriotism" of French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
The reservations against FDI (as against anything foreign) can be found in all groups of countries, when politicians put them at the forefront protectionism is not far.
Yet it would be ironic if the developed countries, which led the wave of liberalization of FDI last twenty years, a backlash.
Hopefully the movement die - liberalization seen in developed countries can be checked before it spreads to other parts of the world and make all suffer undesirable consequences.
The culture of energy.
From climate change to volatile oil prices, all indications are that a global energy crisis seems about to happen.
To meet this challenge, humanity can no longer afford to ignore the inexhaustible resource of biological materials that the sun provides each day through photosynthesis.
Solar energy enables plants to absorb carbon and thereby produce not only oxygen, but also matter that the animal kingdom uses for food, and that our machines can use for energy.
Since Neolithic times, humans grow this biomass to feed.
In our time too, its energy potential is ignored.
From the industrial revolution, humans sought energy in coal, and later oil and natural gas, which leads to the depletion of resources that are not renewable.
Existing alternatives for diversifying energy production are limited.
Nuclear energy has a number of drawbacks, particularly in terms of safety and radioactive waste.
Hydroelectric power is already widely used, as for wind and solar energy, they are structurally sporadic and unevenly available.
Biomass, however, has several advantages.
It is widely used in large quantities throughout the world.
In addition, it has long been mastered the technology necessary to convert it into energy, including high yield charring, gasification and synthetic fuel liquefaction.
This technology is widely used during World War II, has seen considerable progress since.
The biomass energy is, however, a victim of unfair competition from fossil fuels.
Oil prices reflects its extraction, refining and distribution costs, but not those of the creation of the raw material.
Millions of years and 200 tons of plants are needed to produce one liter of oil, while it only takes 15 kilograms of plant material to make one liter of synthetic fuel.
When oil flowed to less than US $ 20 a barrel, the appeal of developing energy from biomass has decreased and attractive only to "green" militants and those interested in the basic sciences .
Yet the potential is immense.
The biomass of the planet's forests, grasslands, savannas, and crops up productive capital that generates a "yield" of 10% each year.
Just like a battery that runs out and is then recharged by the sun, this supply is renewable indefinitely, as long as it is properly managed.
The annual return on this capital is currently estimated at 60 billion tons, yet only two billion tons is consumed for food purposes and 10 billion tons for energy.
Increasing the responsible use of this energy source would contribute to the fight against climate change by reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and diminishing the amount of fossil fuel required to produce energy.
Moreover, its abundance in southern countries promises to facilitate their economic development.
Considered "energy poor" until today, biomass could become a source of wealth provided it is grown and operated with the support of the international community.
Thus, "energy crops" could be developed to produce biofuel.
Residues of forest, agricultural and agro - industrial could be collected and converted.
The six million tonnes of waste produced annually by Niger could theoretically be used to fully meet the energy needs of this country.
Growing energy surely would compete with food crops in many countries.
Estimates of the long-term project that by age 50, most of the arable land on the planet should be used to produce food and for the protection of forest resources.
Therefore, the areas dedicated to energy production, particularly biofuel, may not reach the desired level by corporations.
But although such competition reveals new global shortages, also leading to higher prices, thereby encouraging producers to increase yields and productivity.
Certainly energy crops would create new constraints, but also open new possibilities for many economic actors.
The farmer and forester could invest in the market, the minor interest to crops, the banker plant assets, etc ..
It is necessary to implement new policies in the countries of the north and south in terms of agriculture, water management and land, protection of biodiversity, fuel taxes, of information and public awareness, to prepare for increased energy crops.
The ancient Egyptians and the Incas practiced sun worship because they thought he was the source of all life on Earth.
Science has given reason for them.
Today, it has become more important than ever to use renewable resources, we should use the Sun to cultivate our energy, just as our ancestors did for their food.
The culture of entrepreneurship.
Governments around the world want to promote entrepreneurship.
While many start - ups will never magnitude, every small business is an experience, and it takes a lot to give birth to only one capable of transforming the economy of a nation, or even just to gain international dimension.
In short, entrepreneurship is an incubator, also essential to long-term economic success.
Nowadays, to explain the differences in terms of start-ups of a country to another, we look at the differences in attitudes and national policies.
But we must also take into account big differences within countries.
People in Shanghai are seems - it most enterprising of this view than Beijing.
The inhabitants of the Ukrainian Kherson city are more than those of Kiev.
In a recent study, Giannetti and Andrei Simonov Mariassunta, the Stockholm School of Economics, showed the extent of differences in the field of entrepreneurship in Swedish cities.
They define entrepreneurs as people who report resources from firms they control and in which they work at least part time, and find that the proportion of entrepreneurs in the population differs consistently in the 289 cities they studied, ranging from 1.5% to 18.5%.
These differences tell us about the real causes of business creation?
The political changes at the national level can not themselves justify the variations observed by Gianetti and Simonov.
In the 1980s and early 1990s, the central wage agreements thresholds were dissolved and the Swedish government has lowered income taxes and business.
As a result, the number of entrepreneurship in the country has doubled, but the response was very different from one city to another.
Why?
Cultural variables seem to take much: half of the changes is to put on the account of religion and municipal politics.
The cities have more entrepreneurs if they have a high proportion of retired members of the Church of Sweden (official state church until 2000) and therefore the right of voters.
In addition, there is a rebound effect: cities with more entrepreneurs tend to create many more.
Once an entrepreneurship culture takes root, it extends as people know more about the world of business and begin to feel attracted - even if the benefits are not immediately palpable .
Indeed, Giannetti and Simonov found that the average income of the CEO is lower in cities with the largest number of start-ups than in those who have less.
Similarly, studies from other countries show that entrepreneurs often earn less initially and see their incomes rise less quickly than if they were employees.
These studies suggest that the differences in entrepreneurial might - be less due to better economic opportunities (the "supply" side of the entrepreneurship equation) than to cultural differences that make creating more rewarding business from a personal point of view ("demand").
This hypothesis is put forward by Giannetti and Simonov, who believe that differences prestigious entrepreneurs in different cities can justify the disparities.
In some municipalities, entrepreneurs enjoy high social status, whether successful or not; Moreover, they are not considered, and other activities are more admired.
The idea that prestige is important is not new.
In his book Morals and money, the sociologist Mich√®le Lamont compared definitions of success in France and the United - States.
She asks the people of both countries it means to be "a valuable person."
In fact, she consults on what is important in life and their personal notion of identity.
Lamont's study confirmed the conventional adage for Americans, success in business is important, while the French place primarily culture and quality of life.
Likewise, open contempt of businessmen "greedy" and competition is more often expressed in France than in America.
But while Lamont focused on differences between the French and Americans, the most interesting finding of the research is the significant differences between the various French regions.
It compares Clermont - Ferrand, head - instead of Auvergne, in central France, and Paris.
The Auvergne have a reputation for parsimony and rigor, and very consistent despite recent progress, relative cultural shortage.
Lamont found that as the Parisians that Clermontois tended to have contempt for greed.
In contrast, Clermont believe simplicity, pragmatism, hard work, and commitment, while the Parisians focus more on the strength and talent.
It concludes that, in many ways, the Clermont are closer to the Hoosiers (people of the US state of Indiana in the Midwest) than the Parisians.
His research suggests that in Clermont - Ferrand, the intrinsic demand for entrepreneurship is stronger than in Paris.
Virtually all countries are sets of local cultures that differ in how they motivate people and shape their identity.
Differences in how these cultures define what it means to be a person of worth, and how that value is seen, probably explain much of the variation in levels of business creation.
Economists are not the only ones who often consider the country as a whole, and to designate the attitudes and national policies as the main factors in encouraging or discouraging entrepreneurship.
But, in fact, the national success in this area depends on the evolution of local cultures and their interaction with national policies.
Enthusiasm for business creation can take root in any culturally attractive region of any country, once lifted the economic constraints that make her dam and gain national importance by feeding him - even .
University Investments.
Yale University, where I teach, has entrusted its endowment portfolio to one person, David Swensen, for over 20 years.
During this period, the portfolio has grown from just over $ 1 billion to $ 18 billion, an average return of over 16% per year, which is the highest of any major university.
And he shows no sign of weakness; during the last fiscal year ending June, the yield was 22.9%.
If the Presidents of Yale have come and gone, but Swensen stays.
He has done more for the university than any other president, or anyone for that matter.
In a university, ideas count more than money, but $ 18 billion can create an environment for many new ideas.
With 11,500 students, it is more than $ 1.5 million per student (not including the university's buildings and art collection, worth several billion dollars each).
How it has been possible?
Swensen's how he was able to make so much money?
Everyone is wondering - including us at Yale.
Indeed, many here teaching the "efficient markets hypothesis", which claims that financial markets of the world have become so competitive that it is impossible to get a return on investment greater than normal.
Anyone who beats the market must simply be lucky.
Studies seem to confirm this.
For example, a 2004 study by Brad Barber and Terrance Odean of the University of California, Yi - Tsung Lee and Yiu - Jane Liu at the National Chengchi University, collected data on a transaction by transaction day of individual traders Taiwan Stock Exchange.
The study found that only 1% of day traders made a profit - after deducting transaction costs - in two consecutive six months and the median profit was hardly worth the effort: only $ 4,000 US about.
It is easy to conclude that it is useless to try to beat the market.
But then one remembers people like Swensen.
The constancy of its good results can - it really be attributed to luck?
Robert Kiyosaki, author of the successful series of books on investing Rich Dad, Poor Dad, based titles and themes of his works on a comparison of his own highly educated father and the father of his friend, who left the school in fourth.
According to Kiyosaki, his poor but scholarly dad tended to be pessimistic about the possibilities of each achieve something in real life, so he discouraged his son to try.
However, the father of his friend loved trying to do great things.
The fact that he has become rich - it a coincidence?
Kiyosaki may try - too hard to be inspirational, but I often think of him when I hear finance professors opine on the efficiency of markets and the absurdity of it has to earn money by through transactions.
It may be that many academics find it difficult to take action in the real world - and I have yet to meet another professor who has mentioned having read Kiyosaki.
But Swensen is an academic, doctor of economics.
It is surrounded by academics.
All this talk about efficient markets have not discouraged to try his luck and get there.
There seems to be a pattern here.
Two similar universities, Harvard and Princeton, have had nearly the same success.
The Harvard endowment, under Jack Meyer, increased its average annual return of 15.2% over the last ten years, which can be compared to 17.2% of Swensen and the Princeton endowment under Andrew Golden, earned an average of 15.6% per year.
In fact, Golden worked under the aegis of Swensen at Yale from 1988 to 1993.
Swensen has written two books about investing, one for professionals and one for the general public.
In the closing, I have not had the feeling of being able to do what he did.
But a few things stand out to me.
One of them is its long-term vision.
Yale lets Swensen invest for the very long term, and do not bother with quarterly results.
This allows it can - being to focus more on long-term fundamentals, and so make investments that do not necessarily have a good short-term performance.
But in fact, he consistently performed well in both the short and long term.
Part of the success of Swensen is "absolute return," a term now widely used in the investment community, he coined to describe unusual investment strategies involving such things as merger arbitrage - acquisitions and difficulties (distressed securities).
He also invested in non-traditional assets such as real estate, oil, timber, private equity, capital - risk and corporate recovery companies.
These assets are generally not followed by many analysts, and are not easy to understand, which gave him a greater advantage by leveraging its intellectual capacity and know - how his entourage.
In this sense, Swensen is completely different from day traders, who invest in the short term and trying to beat the most crowded market, the publicly traded securities.
But I also think that the phenomenal success of Swensen and others like him reflects the environment that Kiyosaki critical.
The problem is a defeatist attitude, not scholarship.
When an analytical mind, a trained mind to pursue the truth with rigor, as part of a mixed community of such people is set free from self-doubt, it can produce amazing things.
I know David Swensen, I can attest that this is not a lonely day trader trying to beat the market.
He knows how to listen, support the people he trusts, and is surrounded by many people in many and varied qualities.
And it has nothing of a defeatist.
A moral power.
According to forecasts, global meat consumption is expected to double by 2020.
Yet in Europe and North America, we wonder more and more about the moral aspect of meat production methods and eggs.
Veal consumption has dropped since it became widely known that to produce so-called veal "white" (actually pale pink), calves new - born babies are separated from their mothers, anemic voluntarily deprived of fiber and packed in stalls so small that he can not walk or turn around.
In Europe, mad cow shocked many, not just because it has parts of the image healthy and safe food beef, but also because the public learned that the disease was caused by feeding cows fed sheep brains and nervous tissues.
People who naively believed that cows ate grass discovered that flocks for our food could eat anything from corn to fish, chicken litter (manure included) of slaughterhouse waste.
Concern about how we treat farm animals is far from being limited to the small percentage of vegetarians or vegans, who consume no animal products.
Despite strong ethical arguments for vegetarian practices, they do not represent the prevailing view.
The most common position is that our meat consumption is justified as long as the animals live a proper life before being killed.
The problem, as Jim Mason and I describe in our recent book, The Way We Eat, is that industrial agriculture denies animals a chance to have a proper life.
Tens of billions of chickens produced today never go out.
Are packaged so that they have a voracious appetite and gain weight as fast as possible and then raises them in sheds that can hold more than 20,000 animals.
The ammonia levels in the air, due to the accumulation of their droppings stings the eye and hurts the lungs.
Killed 45 days, their immature bones can hardly bear the weight of their bodies.
Some collapse and, unable to reach food or water, soon die. Their fate is only a negligible amount to the whole company of the economic ladder.
Conditions are even worse for laying hens crammed into cages son of iron, so small that even if they were only one per cage, they would be unable to open the wings.
But they are usually crowded by four, often more.
Under such crowded conditions, the more dominant, aggressive hens can sting the lowest in the cage to death.
To prevent this, producers sear off all birds' beaks with a hot blade.
The beak of a chicken is full of nerve tissue. It is, after all, her principal means of communication with its environment, but no anesthetic or analgesic is used to relieve pain.
Pigs may - be the most sensitive and intelligent animals we used to eat.
When foraging in a rural village, they can exercise that intelligence and explore their environment and diversity.
Before they give birth, sows use straw or leaves and twigs to build a comfortable and safe nest in which to nurse their litter.
But in today's factory farms, pregnant sows are kept in crates so narrow that they can not turn around, or even make more than a step forward or backward.
They lie on bare concrete without straw or any other form of bedding.
The piglets are taken from the sow as soon as possible for her to get pregnant again, but they never leave the shed before being led to the slaughter.
Defenders of these production methods argue that this is a regrettable but necessary response to the population's demand for food continues to grow.
On the contrary, when we confine animals in factory farms, we have to grow food for them.
The animals burn most of the energy from the food just to breathe and keep their bodies warm, so we will reap in the end only a small fraction, usually no more than a third and sometimes only a tenth of the value of the food we give them.
In contrast, cows grazing in the meadows eat food that we can not digest, which means they add to the amount of food available to us.
It is tragic that countries like China and India, as they get richer, copying Western methods and parquent animals in huge industrial farms to supply more meat and eggs for their middle classes developing.
If this continues, the result will be animal suffering on a larger scale than what currently exists in the West, more damage to the environment and an increase in heart disease and cancers of the digestive system.
This will also be totally ineffective.
As consumers, we have the power and the moral obligation to refuse to support farming methods cruel to animals and bad for us.
Fear and Freedom on the Internet.
We learned earlier this month at the request of China's rulers, Microsoft closed the website of a Chinese blogger hosted by a Microsoft service called MSN Spaces.
The blogger, Zhao Jing, had published information about a strike by journalists at The Beijing New, who had followed the dismissal of the free editor - Journal thinker.
Microsoft's action raises a question - key: Internet can - it really be a liberating force that authoritarian governments can not control as easily as newspapers, radio and television?
How ironic, when you think that the founder and CEO of Microsoft, Bill Gates, has been an enthusiastic advocate of this view.
Last October, he just said, "There really is no way, in a broad sense, repress information today, and I think it's a wonderful progress that should all rejoice ... C ' is a means of communication with an opening and a total freedom, and that's what makes it so unique. "
Despite these sentiments, Microsoft is helping its best the Chinese authorities to censor information.
A door - Microsoft spokesman said that the company had blocked "many sites" in China, and is known for several months that the tool used to make Chinese blogs filters words like "democracy" and "human man "when they appear in the blog titles.
Microsoft's defense is that it must "comply with local and global laws."
But the MSN Spaces sites are maintained on servers States - united.
Local laws to be observed in this case are those of the States - United and discussions Zhao Jing on the Beijing journalists' strike does not violate any of them.
There is no global laws that prevent Chinese people from discussing events that their government would prefer not to see them addressed.
The New York Times, for example, is free to publish its report on the strike, even if it is broadcast on a website that all users benefit from free access can view.
If the Chinese government does not want its citizens to read a foreign newspaper, it is for him to find a way to block access to them.
The newspaper is under no obligation to do so in his place.
Microsoft's defense is so long.
We can only guess the real reasons that led him to close the site; and fear of repercussions against its commercial interests in China may well be a major factor.
Of course, a company can and should place limits on the use of its services.
The absolutist line, which is to leave absolute freedom prevail, crumbles in the face of uncomfortable examples.
According to Gates, Microsoft might prevent the use of its services if they were used to disseminate instructions for making a nuclear bomb, sending of Nazi propaganda in Germany, where it is illegal, and to propagate the pedophile pornography.
These examples are - they really valid?
In his classic defense of freedom of expression, On Liberty, John Stuart Mill argued that the most important reason for freedom of expression is to promote competition between the widest possible ideas and debate without hindrance is the best way to test them.
Protecting the ideas of criticism, the government turns them into rigid dogma and lifeless, they are true or not.
If we agree with Mill, then only one of Gates's examples falls into the category of expression that should be protected.
Recipes for making nuclear bombs are techniques, not ideas.
The pedophile pornography is not the expression of ideas.
We may therefore restrict both without contradicting the thesis of Mill.
(On the other hand, an essay arguing that there is nothing wrong with adults taking a sexual interest in children, and that such conduct should be permitted, expresses ideas, and also that ignoble 'they may seem to us, as such should not be censored.).
The most difficult of the three examples is that of pro Gates statements - a site for Nazi Germany.
It is easy to understand why Germany would wish to prohibit such statements.
The laws of many countries prohibit incitement to racial hatred, which can be justified, in agreement with the defense of freedom of Mill, if such legislation is closely focused on the incitement of hatred rather than on suppressing theses are as bad - they, that appeal to people's intellectual capacities.
A defender of suppression of Nazi ideas might argue that have already been tried and have failed, in the most horrendous manner imaginable, to produce a better society.
Anyway, the best possible sign that would show that Germany has overcome its Nazi past would be to focus its laws specifically on racial hatred, rather than on Nazism as such.
In any case, China's repressive measures against direct reports and discussion of events taking place in this country do not return to the suppression of a discredited political ideology, but that of a open and informed political debate.
If Bill Gates really believes that the Internet should act as a liberating force, he should ensure that Microsoft is not doing the dirty work of the Chinese government.
Weaknesses of a strong dollar.
It is always dangerous to write an article on the exchange rate.
If the exchange rate of a currency drops, it may very well be on the rise when the article appears.
Remains the perpetual question of how to think about exchange rates and their appropriate management.
The issue here is not only the dollar down, but rather what US officials intend to implement in this regard.
Paul O'Neill, the very direct US Secretary of Finance suggests that States - States can not and do not want to intervene to support the dollar.
His remarks were criticized by some who see evidence of abandoning the strong dollar policy that characterized the Clinton administration.
One of the responsibilities for economic leadership is to dispel economic myths, certainly not to create them.
The policy of "strong dollar" is a particularly egregious example of the economic myths that may develop. This myth suggests that the US Treasury could, and would, maintain a strong dollar and a strong dollar would be beneficial to the States - States.
When I headed the Economic Council of the White House, he was often asked if I supported the strong dollar policy.
I always answered that I supported the policy of "balanced dollar."
In other words, exchange rates are no different from other prices.
Like the price of apples or oranges, they should be set by market forces.
Anyone who declare prefer a policy of "strong orange" would immediately be mocked.
Yet many people seem to have the greatest confidence in the law of the market consider the exchange rate as governed by laws other than those of the ordinary economy that would a word or even a glance from the Minister of Finance may raise or lower the currencies.
Currency markets are of course very irrational.
Keynes once described the securities markets as beauty contests where the aim was not to evaluate the most beautiful person but which person would top the other.
The purpose of a foreign exchange market, in fact, is often to guess what others think.
And even if government policies can affect the short-term exchange rate in the long term, only market rules count.
The government can find a legitimate role to play in limiting the volatility of the market, but if the basic rules of the market does not lead the way in exchange rates, where does our confidence in the law of the market?
Sticking to erroneous notions inevitably leads to greater misunderstandings.
It happened one day that a journalist asked the Minister of Finance US on the negative effects of the strong dollar on exports (at the time, car sales and other exports were suffering from the strong dollar) .
He said that a strong dollar meant that the economy was strong and therefore, exports were in reinforced.
However, even the Ministry of Finance, as strong as it is, can not overcome the laws of the market economy.
The demand curves bend: so, when prices are high, US products are less popular, and a strong dollar means that American goods are more expensive.
The most significant counterpoint to the strong dollar policy is the fact that it encourages precisely this confusion between a strong dollar and a strong economy.
We should not we sentimentally attached to the exchange rate than at any other price.
A high exchange rate discourages exports, and to unemployment of its workforce, a country may see its economy go from bad to worse.
Moreover, a higher exchange rate may also help to lower inflation, as import prices fall.
If inflation is the primary concern when a high exchange rate can be beneficial for the economy.
The strong dollar policy reeks hints of an economic nationalism that stands out in the era of globalization.
If the dollar is strong, while the euro and the yen weakened.
And what then are the reactions of the political leaders of other countries?
Must - they simply comply with the strong dollar policy, even if this means the yen or the weak euro policy?
It is necessary to create the conditions for a debate with the States - United since the strong dollar policy leads to an unusual situation the richest country seems unable to live up to its means and must continually borrow hundreds billions of dollars abroad to finance its huge trade deficit.
The strong dollar fueled the bilateral deficit with Japan more than Japanese protectionism did.
He also contributed to the protectionist policies of States - States that we see at work today in steel prices.
It is high time that the ineptitude of the strong dollar policy be abandoned.
Paul O'Neill should be commended for its efforts in this area.
Can - could be - we now launch a serious reflection on the creation of an international economic system taking into account the devastating effects of the volatility of the market for the major currencies for the least developed countries, to ensure greater stability.
We have for too long accused the victims.
This has helped us to avoid seriously examine the system itself - even.
China she cheats on her world?
Cheating!
How to declare states - the US, China could - it undercut American producers in so many areas?
For decades, America seemed to dominate manufacturing, so that US officials have focused on liberalizing trade in manufactured goods.
They have devoted little effort to establishing a certain equality for farmers because they knew America could not compete agriculturally.
China now outweighs other countries, earning huge trade surplus with the United - States.
The US Treasury Secretary accuses China of deliberately keeping its exchange rate low and asked him to leave the market trends determine the value of reminbi.
The chief economist of the IMF, Ken Rogoff, who leaves his post, warns that trade surpluses threaten global stability.
For those who remember the crisis that occurred in East Asia five years ago, all this seems to contradict what was said at that time.
China was urged not to let its currency float.
Until the collapse of the Argentine peso, the fixed exchange rate agreed perfectly.
The US Treasury Department has welcomed government intervention in the market exchange rates and encouraged the IMF to support such interventions paying mega billion to countries in crisis.
If China had again let its currency float, it - it would deprecated and would have intensified the crisis.
Countries were warned: avoid trade surpluses and accumulating reserves since these are the main first-line defense.
The East Asian countries have followed this advice, for good reason: they had already seen the consequences of a lack of reserves.
The governments of East Asia knew then that the IMF's policies would only serve to exacerbate their economic downturn, but they have been unable to resist.
The IMF had the money they urgently needed.
China and Malaysia, lucky enough not to have to turn to the IMF or brave enough to follow their own course of action, acted as it should: they led expansionary monetary and fiscal policies.
China's economy continued to grow at 7%; Malaysia has experienced the economic downturn shorter and shallower possible.
To understand the issues of this economic struggle, it is necessary to explain some basic economic concepts in detail.
First, international trade is based on the principle of comparative advantage; countries export goods in which they have a comparative advantage and importing those in which they have a comparative disadvantage.
In general, America now has a relative disadvantage in manufacturing, while China has a relative advantage.
China has to export manufactured goods to the United - States.
Second, if a country invests more than it saves, it will have to borrow and therefore experience a trade deficit.
The emerging trade deficit of America resulted from the unprecedented bad management of the Bush Administration.
Tax cuts that America could ill afford turned a huge fiscal surplus into a massive deficit; rather than to save the US government borrows much of which abroad.
This is mismanagement, not China's exchange rate policy, which is the culprit.
In fact, the overall trade surplus of China is currently small (about 1% of GDP).
Of course, the Bush administration wants to blame others, but neither China nor any other country should not be fooled.
This reminds of the events that occurred twenty years ago, when President Reagan had developed huge tax cuts intended redress the situation, but have actually resulted in huge fiscal deficits, which in turn led to huge trade deficits .
At that time, it was in Japan that America had blamed the deficits!
The truth is that neither the IMF nor the Bush administration really believes in free markets.
They hinder market when they find it their interest.
The Bush administration has bailed out the airlines, has brought unprecedented agricultural subsidies and protected the tariffs on steel.
The IMF is right: there is a real risk of global instability, but under - lying cause of this threat is the massive borrowing by states - States abroad, which began under President Reagan.
The United - States have become a debtor country with massive debts.
If, someday, America's creditors decide to want to be reimbursed, they could trigger large movements in exchange rates and thus lead to global instability.
Why the IMF does not he severely criticized these deficits?
Why the richest countries in the world should - live in it - its means while the IMF reprimanded the poorer countries for smaller transgressions?
This problem is compounded by the global reserve system that welcomes applications from most US dollars applicants countries, but only penalizes them further.
The system requires that the country holding the reserve currency (in this case, the United - States) accumulates debts until other countries do more trusted.
But to solve deep-seated problems in the global financial system, we need to overcome complacency that has long invaded the G - 7 and the unilateralism that defines the current US Administration.
China has been right to ignore America's requirements.
The floating of the exchange rate would have exposed the country to instabilities that would have led to a host of other problems, including those with precarious hit the banking system of the country.
A higher exchange rate would have shaken the job creation process and contributed to the deflation that China is able to regrow.
China is fortunate to have the freedom to pursue its own goals.
Its huge foreign exchange reserves allow him to ignore the IMF and the US Treasury.
Finally, this freedom may be the most compelling reason why China should continue to run trade surpluses.
Once again, China has shown its mastery of basic economic principles.
Other countries in the region lament not having done the same.
Will Italy survive Berlusconi?
If history seems to store Silvio Berlusconi in the category of First Italian ministers second order, he will leave still remember a prime minister out of the ordinary and weirder.
Make a promise, but hold another was instead a principle of government action than a weakness.
Given its unpredictability, it is not surprising that since the 2001 election that brought him to power, the center coalition - left Unione has won every election that followed (administrative and regional elections European).
But the success of the left in the next election is not guaranteed and the fate of Berlusconi is not yet sealed.
Given the economic situation, it may seem ripe for change Italy.
For four years, the average income increased by only 0.3% per year, while it increased on average by 1.5% in the European Union, and for two years public debt has again started to widen.
The strategy of the coalition of center - right Berlusconi, Casa della Libert√†, was to do nothing until the European economy is recovering, instead of addressing the structural problems in Italy.
This is why it is not just the unions who criticize the government, but also the employers' organization Confindustria although it had put its weight behind Berlusconi in 2001.
It must also reckon with the incessant conflict of interest between Berlusconi and Prime Minister Berlusconi newspaper magnate who holds licenses in the audiovisual field giving it a position of semi - monopoly for advertising in the media and on TV .
During his term, his personal fortune was multiplied by three.
The parliamentary majority passed many laws for his personal interests and smoothed some - some legal obstacles that stood in his way. However, in early March, Berlusconi was again accused of corruption and tax evasion.
The conduct of his ministers was much better.
Two of them, Roberto Calderoli and Francesco Storace, were forced to resign one month apart.
The first, a leader of the Northern League, the third party in the governing coalition in order of importance, provoked riots in Libya by wearing a T - shirt with the abominable caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad.
The second, a former health minister and a leader of the National Alliance, the second largest party in the coalition government, is suspected to be the cause of political espionage, in a Watergate Italian.
Despite this disastrous situation, from the point of view of the economy of ethics, according to polls, the Unione displays a four-point lead just too few for the number of undecided voters to predict result of the vote.
What - what makes Berlusconi and his coalition are still in the race?
Above all, Berlusconi's electoral campaign, like that of Bush in 2004, aims to mobilize supporters and attract the growing mass of voters.
For this, he has not hesitated to use his semi - monopoly on television to praise the so - called marvels of his government.
His campaign rhetoric is based on anticommunism that we had not seen in Italy since 1948, coupled with a defense of the family and values ‚Äã‚Äãcherished by the establishment of the Roman Catholic Church, this although the Church has not so far left draw in the campaign.
The Berlusconi coalition also benefits from the weakness of l'Unione.
Its leader, Romano Prodi, obtained an extraordinary popular support with more than four million votes in primary elections, the first of its kind in Italy.
But he - even without a party, it continues to be the leader of too many parties.
The cohesion of the Unione has strengthened: the two major parties (di Sinistra and Democratici Democrazia e Libert√† - Margherita) gathered behind the emblem of the olive, the other parties went okay on a program Government detailed in a document of 280 pages and the left party Partito della Rifondazione Comunista has given signs of moderation unambiguous and loyalty to the coalition.
Nevertheless, in the eyes of voters, the coalition remains fragile.
Finally, the uncertainty of the election outcome reflects not so much the attitude of voters that change the electoral system.
During the last decade, the Italian electoral system was based on a majority vote at a round with a dose of proportional.
With this system, Casa della Libert√† managed in 2001 to turn a small electoral advance a decisive parliamentary majority.
But fearing that this system now has the Unione, the parliamentary majority center - right has changed electoral rules just months before the end of his term.
This is reminiscent of the military strategy of defeat before the looming on the battlefield, to poison the wells before retreat.
A proportional system with no possibility to choose individual candidates that they are the party secretaries, rather than citizens, will choose deputies, and in the absence of a real electoral threshold, parties proliferate.
Ballots will be 40 centimeters long and their containing all symbols of the new and old parties, but we will not find the name of a single candidate.
But the most serious is that the electoral system for the Senate could lead to a majority opposed to that of Parliament, causing political deadlock.
And that's not all, the mandate of President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi will end at a time when Parliament will be dissolved, so that his successor will be elected by the new members may have - be appoint a government with a different majority in each House.
Berlusconi and Prodi have ruled out a grand coalition of the kind that exists in Germany, a highly unlikely outcome after a campaign in which each of the two candidates has made it clear that the other has no legitimate right to govern.
And one more election would not solve the problem of the electoral system.
The snack - head of the political survival of Berlusconi reflects a wider problem in Europe.
Many Europeans, not just Italians are worried and do not know to where the continent is going.
It is therefore not surprising that opportunist and charlatan like Berlusconi continues to have the hearing.
Italians must decide the future of their country if they want a leader who has the necessary stature.
The game transatlantic critics.
As if the diplomatic spats about Iraq were not enough, relations between America and Europe are slowly poisoned by divergent economic policies.
Indeed, the differences between the economic strategies of the two camps are as sharp as they have been for two decades.
At first glance, the depth of this "policy gap" seems surprising.
The economic outlook for the rest of this year and for 2004 have improved recently in the USA and Europe.
In addition, the US and Europe face a similar challenge: encouraging economic recovery.
But the actions of their government (or lack of action) suggest that neither side can see the problems faced by the other.
During the introduction of the euro, most EU members (Germany in particular) looked forward to managing their economic policies with more autonomy and less strong US pressure.
Thus, the current structure in the euro area, with its unique mix of joint monetary policy and national responsibility for fiscal policy, was not constructed to facilitate coordination of macro - economic with the US.
But the perception of many American observers was different.
They saw the central implication of the Euro as requiring Europe to strip him of his supposed role of "free rider" on the international economic scene, a role that has left the US to shoulder the burden of policy adjustments to promote global growth.
Europe would inevitably be forced to coordinate its policies with America.
These two views were bound to clash and this is what is happening today.
Tensions hidden during the long boom of the Clinton era proved in 2001 when America tried to cope with the decline of its economy by quickly releasing its monetary and fiscal policies.
When large budget deficits resurfaced, European skepticism about the viability of growing external deficit of America and the overvaluation of the dollar also reappeared.
Between - time American critics judged the euro area as too conservative when slowly reduced interest rates and kept the fiscal constraints of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Originally, the Europeans had under - estimated the economic slowdown which they have faced.
Subsequently, they were constrained by the limits on their fiscal reactions limits set by the Maastricht Treaty; major economies of continental Europe had not reached sufficient budgetary consolidation during the years of continuous growth.
Monetary and fiscal policies facilitated growth, but Europe has not done much to redress the external imbalance of America.
Obviously, the euro area is so vast that it can not abdicate responsibility to stimulate global growth in America.
But US efforts to encourage Europeans to adopt their pragmatic and discretionary approach to economic policy inevitably lead to frustration: the problems faced by European economies are different from those facing the US, as the perceptions of challenges.
In fact, the main reasons for the massive change in US public finances (the surplus in 2000 to a deficit of more than 4% in 2003-2004) have little to do with stabilization.
In addition to the cost of the war in Iraq and other security issues and breaches in previous spending controls, US tax cuts obey structural and distributional goals rather than short-term goals.
A short-term stimulus would not have bestowed the most significant benefits to the wealthiest people whose costs are less sensitive to taxes.
Tax cuts should support private demand this year and next year, but at the cost of postponing improvements in economies and private debts.
Although the dollar has been depreciated for a year, continued growth in domestic demand will likely push the current account deficit to exceed 5% of GNP.
While the deficit is growing more, it is likely that the dollar is again depreciated despite the rather slow performance of the other major world economies.
The US will accept - they prolonged slowdown after 2004 and Europe it could make a greater contribution to global growth?
Probably not.
The equivalent of the emphasis placed by the USA on independence rather than direct public assistance is represented by the desire to maintain employment at high levels, regardless of the party in power, while most European countries have been prepared to accept unemployment rates of 8% or more.
The US should therefore opt for growth.
Despite three years of weak growth, the gap between the potential return and actual return in the largest economies of continental Europe is now smaller than in the US.
Tax cuts on income to boost labor demand - Lumber and investment are desirable, given the high rates existing in the largest economies in Europe.
But tax cuts that must soon be canceled mainly because of population pressure on pensions and public health care are unlikely to stimulate demand, consumers lose confidence in indeed the government's ability to control deficits.
Europe needs structural reforms and tighter fiscal management, not inflation.
EU countries are ultimately speeding up implementation of structural reforms, but the starting point has become less favorable and political resistance too firmly anchored, as illustrated by the recent conflict over pension reforms French and German labor market.
A further depreciation of the dollar and slower US growth would undermine EU exports, the one relatively successful component of demand in Europe.
The policy divergence and time horizon will be hidden by the improved growth outlook in Europe and the USA for the coming year.
But the medium-term perspective is that of a transatlantic confrontation could create as many divisions as conflicts over the war in Iraq.
If this occurs, the Round of international trade negotiations in Doha, which is being held, could be the first to suffer.
It will be harder to resist protectionism on both sides of the Atlantic.
The US can not afford a continuing massive drain of demand through an external deficit, while complaints about loss of competitiveness will intensify in the EU.
The thought that the confrontation macro - economic future could subside quickly or quietly puts imagination to the test.
A multilateral commitment to energy security.
The different countries of the world are also strongly linked by their common need for energy security as the global network that distributes this energy.
A failure in a network point, and we are all affected. Local interests and persistent conflicts that interpose, including the unresolved issue of supplies to Ukraine and Europe with Russian gas, remind us once again that energy can be used as a means of political pressure.
Energy security is one of the priority themes of the G - 8 that receives President Vladimir Putin in Saint - Petersburg.
The G - 8 was able to identify the key economic issue, namely energy interdependence, and now is the time to take specific multilateral commitments in this area.
For some countries, who are fortunate to have vast reserves of oil and gas, it is tempting to use exports to reward friends and punish enemies.
But nowadays, such a strategy is likely to destabilize both friends and enemies, and a loss to the producer.
Embargoes do not usually bring the expected results.
The price increases triggered by the actions of OPEC in the 1970s were not sustainable and encouraged consumption savings and the development of production in countries non - OPEC members.
This led to a fall in the share of OPEC in world oil exports in the twelve years following the embargo of 1973 - 1974.
Experience has taught us that transparency and price stability is in the interest of all.
It is essential to increase the growth potential of the global economy, to keep these principles while encouraging the development of international markets.
When Russia proposed this year to quadruple the price of its gas exports to Ukraine, she claimed applying the market price.
This seemed fair and, for a time, some policymakers and investors unfamiliar with the situation were seduced.
To be clear, measured and gradual evolution of prices has never been challenged; some adjustments were necessary for Ukraine.
But, unfortunately for the neighbors of Russia, it is not the market that sets the price of Russian gas or transportation: it is the company Gazprom and President Dmitry Medvedev, also first vice - Russian Prime Minister.
The price charged by Gazprom is different for each neighbor of Russia, and determined largely by the diplomatic relations of these countries with the Kremlin.
Prices depend more on the political situation of supply and demand or transport costs.
Ukraine was threatened to have his gas bill immediately quadrupled - or interrupted supply - because she had taken of independence from Russia during the Orange Revolution.
Georgia, which had angered Moscow with its Rose Revolution, also might suffer significant price increases.
However Belarus, still very close to the Kremlin, continues to receive significant subsidies in the energy field.
Of course, Ukraine was not the only country affected by these intimidation: some suppliers such as Turkmenistan, as location requires transit gas through Russia, also suffer.
As for the consumer countries of Central and Western Europe, rising prices and fears of supply disruption had important consequences for them.
This is probably the immediate multilateral intervention by the European Union and the United - States that prompted Gazprom to reopen the valves.
Natural gas can - be the raw material supply is most vulnerable to political uncertainty.
The fixed interconnected pipelines compel producers and consumers to almost absolute fidelity.
The diversification of the transportation of natural gas is a long-term cross-border project, which requires considerable investment and a multilateral political commitment.
Many solutions are under consideration: new gas storage devices, increased efficiency, development of domestic oil and gas, and other fuels such as coal bed methane.
In addition, the liquefied natural gas (LNG) market is growing rapidly.
It is easier to diversify the supply chain, even gradually, by importing gas from distant producers rather than from neighboring suppliers enjoying a monopoly.
All these initiatives are expected to absorb impact and create more energy self-sufficiency.
But we must go further.
First, the G - 8 should consider applying standards for transactions in the energy sector, and require open and transparent contracts in line with best business practices.
It is essential to minimize the impact on a global scale local politicians behavioral pursuing non-energy goals, or just their personal interests.
Such problems are observed in the Latin American state enterprises, with political instability in Africa, tensions in the Middle - East or some opaque intermediaries, like the dubious contract for gas between Ukraine and Russia under the name RUE (RosUkrEnergo).
In the end, energy security for all of us in Europe is the recognition of our interdependence.
This is why it would be useful to create an "energy alliance" of consumers and suppliers, in which European countries refuel each other in case of major disturbances.
The Energy Charter, which emphasizes market access and transparency, is a laudable effort but it is insufficient in a crisis. Our markets are not yet sufficiently equipped to manage supply disruptions.
The Energy Charter could be the basis for a collective energy security, provided it is deeper and wider.
It is our duty as leaders, to find a path to the future energy security.
While some today suspicious transactions tolerate political expediency, we all will pay dear one day when the other.
When the inevitable conflicts arise, public confidence, political credibility and market forces are sacrificed unnecessarily. This is clearly what happened with Russia and Ukraine.
Threats to energy security must be tackled and resolved multilaterally, with the participation of all stakeholders.
Our interdependence requires us to adopt a multilateral approach.
It is our future that is at stake.
Reform or Revolution in Iran?
Lebanon at risk of manipulation.
In recent weeks, Lebanese politicians from groups as diverse as Hezbollah and the Christian Lebanese Forces meet from time to time as part of a "National Dialogue".
Their first objective is to build consensus on the future of Lebanon after the withdrawal of the Syrian army, which took place last year.
But that dialogue has shown that Lebanese politics continues to play out of Lebanon.
The Syrian regime of President Bashar Assad retains huge influence on the Lebanese state, especially regarding security issues, the secret services, the army and the police, not to mention its alliance with the powerful militia Hezbollah.
Syrian troops left Lebanon a year ago, but the regime of Assad has never accepted its withdrawal from Lebanon, and it seeks to regain some form of hegemony over the country.
Syria's position is made more difficult because of the UN investigation, which accuses him of involvement in the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri on 14 February 2005.
Lebanese allies of Syria want to improve the links between the two countries, but the Hariri assassination will probably not allow them to succeed.
At the moment, the Lebanese parties have agreed not to leave the country as a basis to threaten in any way the Syrian regime.
At the same time, Egypt and Saudi Arabia want desperately to avoid the downfall of Assad's regime.
Publicly, they are in favor of the UN investigation, but privately they have encouraged, the Lebanese government to release the pressure on Syria.
In Lebanon, the adversaries of Syria have resisted such demands, but the position of Egypt and Saudi Arabia shows that Arab leaders do not want the fall of the other despots in the region.
The attitude of Egypt and Saudi Arabia can not be more different from that of two very influential Western powers in Lebanon, the US and France, which support the UN inquiry wherever it leads .
Nevertheless, all four states agree that Syrian influence in Lebanon must be curbed, and they are in favor, at least in theory, the disarmament of Hezbollah required by Resolution 1559 of the Security Council, even though their views differ on how to get there.
Another regional problem, the endless cycle of violence between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq, shaping Lebanese domestic politics.
Sunnis and Shiites of Lebanon - the two main communities in the country due to their demographic weight and the backing they enjoy in the area - are far from being at this stage, but recently the political tension is palpable between them.
Hariri was the leading Sunni politician, and after his murder both communities have adopted diametrically opposed positions with respect to Syria.
The divide between Shiites and Sunnis in Lebanon reflects broader regional differences between the majority of Arab countries (including Saudi Arabia) are backs Saad Hariri, son of the assassinated prime minister, and Iran, which supports the Hezbollah.
In Saudi Arabia, the Shiites are concentrated in the east, which contains most of the oil fields and the Saudis fear discord between Shiites and Sunnis in Iraq from spreading in the Arab world and reaches them.
That is why Riyadh has encouraged Hariri to keep lines open to Hezbollah, the main force in the Lebanese Shiite community.
Apart from this concern, Saudi Arabia and Egypt are concerned that if Iran manages to own nuclear weapons, it will lead to a dominance of the region by the Shiites.
Add to that the tension between Iran and the US, fueled by the controversy over nuclear power and the conflict in Iraq.
Arab countries are sandwiched between the two, as the Lebanese, who fear the price to pay if American or Israeli attack against Iran's nuclear facilities. For Hezbollah could then attack Israel from southern Lebanon.
Hezbollah has interpreted UN demands for its disarmament as a Bush administration plot to weaken and display the American supremacy in the region.
He refuses to disarm at what he called "Israeli threat", but it has so many times changed its definition of this threat that one wonders if he never give up arms.
It recently agreed to include this issue on the agenda of domestic political negotiations - can - perhaps because Iran does not want this to become a cause of tension in the country - but it is unlikely they lead real disarmament, at least in the short term.
Finally, the Lebanese must not only operate according to regional and international policy considerations, but must also consider domestic American politics.
Whatever opinion one has about the war in Iraq, it must be admitted that the US presence there has helped Lebanon to thwart the attempts of Syria to put foot in Lebanon, and those of some Arab countries to force Lebanon to deal with a regime that does not adapt its sovereignty.
If the US administration in full withdrawal from Iraq would likely become indifferent to the Lebanese situation.
In that case, who else that Syria and Iran would benefit from that?
Such an outcome might satisfy some parts of Lebanese society, particularly Hezbollah.
But the vast majority of Lebanese want a Lebanon in peace, free from the isolation and activism that characterize Iran and Syria.
Unfortunately, Lebanon has always been buffeted by its surroundings and once again, against the will of the Lebanese people, it may serve as an arena for destructive regional conflicts.

Transactions with ƒåEZ shares reached almost half the usual daily trading.
Tuesday at the start of trading, the Prague Stock Exchange reestablished with its fall the day before, when lost almost six percent.

The market's reaction to the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the plan to stabilize the US financial sector, so is also evident here.
Shares Fall in Asia.

According to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal supports the financial system.
Otherwise, we risk that other countries are impacted.
The bloodbath of US equities.
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the project supports the financial system, which she would have had to spend up to $ 700 billion (almost 12 ridges of Kƒç).
Legislators and disowned the call to supporting the project of President George Bush.
According to Bush, the project should address the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
US stocks lived Monday bloodshed and major equity indices experienced the largest drop in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones lost nearly seven percent have experienced a drop of this magnitude for the last time in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress gave: the US government can inject $ 700 billion into banks.
Leaders of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of financial aid agreement to the US financial system.
It will be put to the vote early next week.
US lawmakers ran a turning point in the talks on the adoption of a bailout in the form of financial assistance amounting to $ 700 billion (about 12 billion crowns) granted to the US financial system .
Success does not mean safe.
Indeed, before publishing the final version of the law and submit it to the vote, the Congressmans must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system supports plan will be discussed Monday at the House of Representatives.
Told Reuters on Sunday Barney Frank, the chairman of the banking and financial regulations of the House.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should a priori be voted on in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the bailout plan will be adopted should be a first major psychological factor to revive the financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms by which the aid market to be effective, will follow a "disappointment."
Paulson: Plan must be effective.
"We have made great progress.
We resolved our differing opinions regarding the form that should have the package of measures to stabilize the market ", entrusted to the Agency Bloomberg Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
According to her, the final vote could take place as early as Sunday.
In the night from Saturday to Sunday, representatives of legislators met the Minister of Finance Henry Paulson US, to give the government the bottom of a final form.
One - should redeem from financial companies, real estate assets that result unmarketable financial firms in considerable losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are about to come to an agreement on a plan that will work and which should be also effective on the market.
It should also pursue this market recovery plan, but I think we're at it, "said Paulson.
A signal for Asian trade.
The global financial crisis had a significant impact on the equity markets fall.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid does √©vadiez, legislators are so that Congress would lead to a final agreement on Sunday.
They want to calm investors prior to the start of trading on the Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone where the decision of Congress may affect trade Monday.
But for now, it is impossible to say with certainty when both chambers of the US Congress will proceed to vote or if negotiations are not likely to remain blocked at the last moment, for a given problem.
Lawmakers hope it will be adopted in the coming days.
Nevertheless, the law still experience many changes.
The total amount for using the system should be divided into two parts.
The first $ 350 billion, as desired by President George Bush, should be available as soon as possible.
But if Congress will have the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, it has the ability to block the granting of the amount remaining following two steps: first an additional 100 billion dollars, and then, finally, $ 350 billion.
Bush hailed progress in the negotiations.
Although the president can to veto this decision, Congress, however, has the possibility of one - one in the minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe program, which was to get finance for the purchase of bad real estate securities whose value dropped because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed Sunday to vote on the law, and the Senate on Monday, "stated Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President George Bush's it - even pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His door - Tony Fratto said speech that Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and enjoyed "the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of golden parachutes.
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said that lawmakers have agreed on the responsibility of financial program, protection against losses contributing the agreement of rebates, the progress of the plan the time axis.
The new law also said plans to limit golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the program and set up a committee which will monitor the fund.
It should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We worked very hard on the issue and have made significant progress toward an agreement that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also provides assistance to homeowners who have problems paying.
The government should negotiate new payments in the case of mortgages it will buy, while reducing monthly payments receivable and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help.
According to the chief economist at Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its realization will be very difficult.
"And this is because we do not know what the mechanism and the price of the redemption of problem assets.
This will be crucial to decide on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government, "said Marek, this week, the server iHNed.cz ..
If the plan is adopted now, or early next week, is not, according to Marek, not that important.
"It is much more important than Congressmans agree, this week, they support this plan and they devote as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, the most important thing right now, "Marek emphasized.
A struggle carried to extremes: MP3 players against mobile.
We will advise you how to choose.
While virtually all mobile can read MP3 files, no MP3 player knows phone.
It seems clear that result is worth buying just a phone.
Nevertheless there are sufficient reasons to obtain an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy an expensive home gramophone upscale to put the new album Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such music products do not come out on vinyl, and the quality point of view, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
But if there is your shelves crammed vinyl, with rock art, jazz or blues, you dream at least probably such a gramophone.
It is the same music on the go, ie compressed music, to put it in a simplified way - music to MP3.
Here, too, there are categories according to price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a drive in the same way that a fan of Pink Floyd could hardly bear headphones purchased for twenty crowns to the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The battery life is also decisive.
Some high-end music players are capable of a lot more than a simple music playback, but this is of unknown functions, of course, the most mobile.
No current device is as universal as the telephone.
Besides the primary functions, phone calls and sending SMS, it is able to play music and movies, save them, it has a variable quality camera and can, for example, up to be used for navigation.
And if we take into account Smartphones and communicators, you will have in your pocket a small computer.
Since no one knows fridge grill meat and no television will take photographs, we are seeing almost a miracle.
However, the mobile universal is not without drawbacks.
The more features you use, the greater the interval between reloads will be reduced.
And playing music is one of the largest energy gluttons.
Are few mobiles that are able to play music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases, this figure is much lower.
In this regard, music players (especially the most rudimentary) are significantly more efficient.
For cheap mobile, expect they will play music for hours.
If, in addition, if you happen to call from time to time, purchase - you, to be sure, a second charge for the job - this applies even for the more expensive units.
If problem does not arise for MP3 players, who are able, after reloading, continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including underperforming.
Another problem arises when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices features a USB connector universal, especially since not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
One can, of course, record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to do without reduction, given the tiny size of the memory cards used in mobile.
Regarding the players, you do not need, with exceptions (iPod), no software.
Simply fill through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobile and readers will create self - a classified media library after the name of the artist, album title, style, and then according to the judgment of the user.
Some devices display an index with a tree structure, like the Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with the operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile longer know - how.
In choosing a specific device, interested - you especially the life of the battery, the memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and, of course, ease of command.
If music is for you, essentially, a background noise in the day and if you listen for a limited time, for example by tram, simply any mobile reading MP3.
Virtually all mobiles are now capable.
You do not even have to do too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or the drive is able to read.
All should come to play MP3 and the vast majority of the music that will be sent to you precisely this format.
He is one of the most common formats and to himself, the great majority of devices can read also the WMA format music.
The AAC (the format used by the Apple company and its iPods), meanwhile, is less common.
The high-end mobile also allow, for example, buying music online.
Just visit from the mobile phone, the operator's web pages (or those of another provider) and corresponding buy the song or album in question.
This alone service should be a compelling reason to buy a musical mobile.
The offer of the operators is miserable and unfortunately it is limited in most cases to radio quickly made tubes.
The prices are not lower.
Nevertheless, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether by GSM, internet or by wireless internet) dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their mobile home.
Each time you want to listen to something, you just have to get out of your pocket mobile while you have forgotten your MP3 player at home.
But it is also important if you still have on you or a handsfree earphones with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the built-in speakers, which have almost all phones, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of mobile music is their price.
Cheapest normally cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three four thousand crowns, you can get a very decent walkman already.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the lack of outlet for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best phones and better equipped, also feature an entry for ordinary headphones does not exceed fifteen miles.
Readers, for against, have the advantage of easy control.
Really anyone manages to maintain control of the most basic drives - which does not necessarily correspond to the cheapest (see our choice).
A minimum functions; and likeness of the command with that of a cassette station, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision as a mobile Internet connected by chance, followed by a huge data bill.
Which device.
Even the cheapest mobile (eg. The Vodafone 527) generally have a slot for memory cards exchangeable (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models do not support the principle that cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive is the same coming out with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon a Creative, Sony, Samsung, a Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2GB), you should not spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are among the most demanding listeners rather choose mobile - Specialized walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control buttons for MP3, and thus the ease of control is similar to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, the mobile of the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one who went furthest in this area.
The same service in the same price, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a life of the battery (normally 15 hours up to 35 hours) above, is provided by a MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned above.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year - the same.
May be.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, our operators offer virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator who would force the classic operators to lower prices.
It may not fail for long.
We have already mentioned repeatedly on Mobil.cz fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The CTU (Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher that the rest of the Union, has confirmed.
Thus, following the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation may occur - text messages sent from abroad will be for some customers of Czech mobile operators cheaper that the country.
How - what possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks competition that would really get into the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we have still three mobile networks and penetration far beyond 100%.
Instead, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely concurrenciez.
In this, Pavel Dvo≈ô√°k, the Chairman of the Czech Telecommunication Office (CTU), which has repeatedly stated that the Czech Republic there was room for another operator, chimed with operators.
It is probably true that a classical operator with its own network has apparently much luck (besides, now he only difficult to find frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators in the mobile market has led to a significant decline in prices, which were subsequently also react conventional operators.
Yet even before the entry of the disorder - festivals such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, similar to those voices that we hear today from us suggested in Great - Britain.
However, it appeared that it was room for such operators and they could have a real success.
We are also not forced to look too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch in Poland, Mobilking virtual operator.
In just six months, this operator has managed to gain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
Adding that behind the Mobilking, there is the financial group Penta, which owns, among other U: fon in Czechia.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a target group much more concrete.
For that to function effectively, they indeed need a lot fewer customers than a classic operator.
They are, in fact, free of construction costs, operating and maintains the mobile network, relatively high.
Thus in the world, virtual operators are emerging as low cost carriers - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often offset by a limited range of services.
For example Tesco Mobile offers, Great - Britain, SMS at least two times cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking Poland, bet on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity stunt.
Indeed, this operator is specifically men.
"Real men choose Mobilking - an operator that they like and which they can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, exploiting this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if such a concept would likely also walk home.
Miroslav ƒåepick√Ω the door - word of Vodafone, questioned: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach is based on which most virtual operators.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the perspective of the supply of services. "
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators.
Nevertheless, it seems almost certain that there will be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but negotiations in the Czech Republic are not very promoters.
The launch of Mobilking will instead take place in other countries in our area, "said in a telephone talks to Mobil.cz Jana Studniƒçkov√° door - word of the Penta financial group.
It thus indirectly confirmed that operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favor of this idea.
Instead, they try to do everything possible to a potential competitor can arise.
GTS Novera group, who would go one step further and to become a real competitor Telefonika in the field of corporate clients, does not hide long enough, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We are keen to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunication services but also mobile.
And the sooner the better.
We have already held talks about this possibility several times with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we managed to move forward in the negotiations, "said the door - word of Pavel Kaidl group.
The future is can - be promising.
According to information non - formal, it seems that we might - be hosting the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for now, its creation is accompanied by total silence.
"Right now, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
Czech market is compared with other very specific.
For the moment, no subject provided a complex and serious project in this area contacted us, "said Vlastimil Sr≈°e≈à of Telefonika O2 Press Department, in its statement to Mobil.cz ..
Other operators are also related to the specificity of the Czech market.
The door - word of T - Mobile Kemrov√° Martina says in a rare agreement with O2 statement: "We have not yet registered a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could be the basis."
She adds: "It is virtually impossible that appears in the virtual operator T network - Mobile by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited time, we should have now a concrete agreement. "
Vodafone directs his attention instead on the fulfillment of requests for its own 3G license.
Miroslav ƒåepick√Ω said in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãshared costs and infrastructure.
This is what we believe means more inputs from the customers' point of view.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is finding a partner to develop a common network for fast mobile internet. "
Responsible authorities: in tune with the operators.
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entrance of another operator would mean increased competition, would have led to lower prices and thus a drop in profit.
So what good to facilitate the achievement of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know how to listen as thick as thieves. The baffle accompanying the creation of U: fon also testifies.
The apparent greater pressure on the CTU during the creation of the U: fon, was that exerted by T - Mobile.
Evidenced by publicly available information from the web pages of the CTU.
But today, U: fon ready to use as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrov√° remarked on this: "Competition in the mobile market has been more recently enhanced by the entry of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of an additional player would submit, and especially its services to high standards. "
But given the attitude of the mobile operators here, indifference of Czech regulators seem disconcerting.
This is, however, not only the attitude of the CTU, which, unlike the Great - Britain and other developed countries, has unfortunately not, the Czech Republic, the power to intervene in economic competition.
One - it belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (√öOHS).
But it passed, deal with this problem, its typical position.
"The entrance of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question concerning the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached for the moment, because the supply of potential interested parties did not a priori shown enough interest for conventional operators, "said in response to our question Kristi√°n Chalupa the department External Relations √öOHS.
A declaration made and would not surprise on the part of representatives of operators.
But from an office, to represent the interests of consumers and among other also take care that no one takes advantage of its market position, such a statement is more than confusing.
Especially as Kristi√°n Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual operators are normally present, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to a decline in prices of mobile telephone services."
Or, to put pressure in the direction of an honest market functioning and lower prices apparently not part of the interests of √öOHS.
What is actually shocking is almost touching harmony of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, this is really a chance, naturally arises.
Similarly, strictly identical gasoline prices at all service stations is probably due to chance and hard fought competition.
"The board has not identified in this regard, signs of a anti-competitive behavior, so it has no reason to intervene in one way or another.
None of the operators has a dominant position, none has therefore increased corresponding responsibility for his behavior on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators probably miss even telecommunications regulator, "said in its statement Chaloupa.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of relevant markets developed by the CTU, that telecommunications is, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some law experts propose another vision: for the creation of a virtual operator is possible, obtain, each time, the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has logically monopoly on its network.
Thus he must play a dominant role in a certain segment of its business.
But even without admitting that argument, it should be at least worrying for the √öOHS three mobile operators obviously proceed in a similar way.
Yet the complaints of many stakeholders (including GTS Novera company, already mentioned) show that they face in negotiations with all operators, similar constraints.
Put the blame on the CTU is a fairly common trick in communications, whereby the √öOHS washes his hands of the matter.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in many similar cases.
Unfortunately we have not managed to get in the novelization of the Telecommunications Act recently adopted a widening of CTU's authority over the area of ‚Äã‚Äãeconomic competition in telecommunications, although many experts promised improved situation.
This, the √öOHS representatives must know very well, but their interests are apparently other.
When no one is looking, it can work.
That said, the operation of a kind of pseudo-virtual operators, several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These companies publishing their own price list of mobile telephone services, but these are not public in part.
In most cases it is a question of companies dealing with the multi - level marketing.
Mobile telephone services particularized are proposed for example by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these firms generally manage to elect.
The magic lies in the fact that the company did before the operator figure of a typical enterprise customer, who control a large amount of SIM cards.
As a valued customer, she received price offers (and other) Special.
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If it happened that you mention, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would consider and that could lead to a judgment of the collaboration with the company in question," he answered our question on Martina Kemrov√° this problem.
Nevertheless, it is quite unlikely that echo such activity did not reach to the leaders of mobile operators.
Particularly in the case of the three companies mentioned there may be thousands of clients.
Auncun operator, however, did say against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring their non-profit - negligible, and at the same time, as opposed to the real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav ƒåepick√Ω indicates possible problems: "The law enables such speculation, however, the services of these companies are only used by a significant percentage of customers.
In addition, they - are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, they therefore can not fully dispose of, like ordinary customers mobile operators. "
Yet it is precisely this that should seem strange at CTU.
In addition, there is another question √öOHS.
If mobile operators condone such a procedure, why block - they create a virtual operator?
It should be added that the √öOHS has relatively broad powers to be able to disclose such activity, and if he does not wish to be content with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual terms prohibiting .
When we will not be the most expensive country.
As we have already mentioned several times, entry of virtual operators in the mobile market has made a significant drop in the price of services.
However, in virtually all countries appeared virtual operators, traditional operators tried, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by them were about the same - too small a market, or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc ..
But it is precisely at this level that have occurred in developed countries, regulatory bodies, which not defending the interests of mobile operators, but those of their clients.
Both by formal measures by informal pressure, they finally get to create a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies treat this issue like a hot potato which is discarded by transmitting to a nearby target.
Following the experiences we have, we can not get rid of the impression that the confusion in competencies in these cases is their highly profitable.
But do not throw in the towel on.
If slides are true information and a virtual operator will soon appear here, the Czech mobile market recovers may - be moving.
If one of the operators accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the √öOHS can not easily remain impassive face of rejection (discrimination) other stakeholders.
And can we stop - be called more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best.
Listen to the four goals of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
Sunday, on the occasion of the Day of Czech nationality, Prime Minister Mirek Topol√°nek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov m≈Øj (Where is my home?).
The anthem was again recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji≈ô√≠ Bƒõlohl√°vek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo vocals, an interpretation with choir and an instrumental version.
The song is performed by Kate≈ôina Knƒõ≈æ√≠nkov√° and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremi√°≈° and Jaroslav Krƒçek are the authors of the hymn arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the server .. iHNed.cz
Bƒõlohl√°vek considers the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As already told before in ƒåesk√Ω rozhlas (Czech public radio), he chose to interpret the solo versions of the singers with young, representative voices that are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I tried to take care that the two singers and the choir have good diction, so that one understands the words they sing simultaneously," he said .
The Czech national anthem will celebrate next year's 175th anniversary.
The song Kde domov m≈Øj heard for the first time in 1834 on the stage of Estates divadlo (the statements of Theatre) in Fidlovaƒçka (Kermesse cobblers), Czech original piece of Kajet√°n Josef Tyl, accompanied by the music of Franti≈°ek ≈†kroup.
It became popular and people have spontaneously appropriate.
After creating the Tch√©coslaovaquie in 1918, the first verse naturally became part of the national anthem.
He remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How sounds the "new" anthem.
Public transport (MHD) introduce Prague on Wednesday, the chip in their ticketing system.
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be recorded in the history of Pra≈æsk√Ω Dopravn√≠ podnik (the Prague Transportation Agency) as the date that come up in the metro, trams and the first passenger bus, which, instead of having a paper ticket, will have in their pocket electronic coupon.
At this point, it is accessible to almost one hundred thousand people, owners of the smart card Opencard.
Passengers can buy a voucher 30 days or 90 days (one - will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both the register on their smart card into the information points and offices of Dopravn√≠ podnik (l Agency transportation), located in the metro stations Muzeum, Mustek, Hole≈°ovice, Andel, Roztyly, Let≈àany, Kobylisy, Rajsk√° zahrada, Kaƒçerov and Luka.
From yesterday, there was also the opportunity to buy coupons online through the web pages of Dopravn√≠ podnik: www.dpp.cz ..
More than four hundred people took advantage of the service during the morning.
Those who begin to use the online store can definitively forget the machines in metro stations, where they were far trample impatience in long lines in order to get paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their internet coupon and register it on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Mƒõstsk√° knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these points contact, there is available to the passengers a window with trained staff who will help interested parties with purchase over the Internet, and more, save the coupon they bought on their card," said the door - word of Martin Opatrn√Ω project.
Besides the library, it will also save digital coupons on Opencard in vending machines in the lobby of several subway stations.
What resemble those distributors?
They are red, reminiscent machines compost tickets and passengers may have - have already noticed in the metro stations Roztyly, Budƒõjovick√°, IP Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk√°.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be four to twenty," added Opatrn√Ω.
PLC control the voucher in place of the driver.
The controllers that will work from tomorrow, are easy to use.
Just insert the card Opencard chip and previously purchased coupon will save him - even on the map.
The electronic coupons are valid beginning tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the vicinity of the city.
Namely in suburban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, mainly used by the inhabitants of the municipalities of the Central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In trains integrated Pra≈æsk√° Integrovan√° doprava (Prague Integrated Transport), controllers are equipped with card readers, by which they establish temporary and zonal validity of coupons;" explained control Filip Dr√°pal ticket Ropid the organization that designs timetables of public transport in Prague.
Suburban buses are equipped with integrated card readers to the body of the driver.
When boarding it is necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but it must also place the Opencard at the location indicated on the side of the box.
Thus, the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"If the passenger would need to check the validity of the coupons recorded, there is nothing easier than requesting this information to the driver," Dr√°pal completed.
Passengers who do not take the suburban bus and do not remember the date expires the validity of their coupon, can rejoin vending machines, originally used to record the coupons on the map.
It was there, on the screen of the device that will display information about the validity of their document.
Sudeten demanding a referendum in the USA.
The Sudeten Germans demanded in 1945 that ≈†umava is incorporated in the United - States.
This follows a letter deposited in the collections of the Jihoƒçesk√° Vƒõdeck√° knihovna (Scientific Library of South Bohemia).
If we can not be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United - States of America.
In 1945, some of Sudeten Germans supposedly addressed groups to the US president with such a desire.
This stems among other a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihoƒçesk√° Vƒõdeck√° knihovna.
ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov Germans pray in the letter the American president not to allow "≈†umavsk√° ≈æupa" (forest area south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - is rendered to Czechoslovakia.
"We understand the situation and want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that American troops are not on the German territory oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter, signed "People, whom fate ≈†umava close to the heart. "
Since the rally in Czechoslovakia is allegedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - that brutality, inconsiderate attitude, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter request the President US to take in his hands the protectorate of ≈†umava for now and forever.
"We can not believe you would give this land to a foreign country to us, oppressing and destroying the minorities and has contributed nothing to the Allied victory without taking into consideration the opinion of the quarter million residents "is written in the letter.
The purported reason for the authors can not sign the letter is the fear of revenge of "Czech oppressors".
If the US president doubted the opinion of the ≈†umava Germans, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish whether its people wanted to be part of the USA, or live under the patronage of the United - States.
Although the text contained in the letter can, given the current knowledge of the history of post - war seem somewhat naive, some survivors, it illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans of the time.
While the Czech Germans had to at least glimpse the issue of expulsion of the republic will arise, very few of them admitted such a possibility.
Some expected that the United - States and Great - Britain would get for the Sudetenland some kind of autonomy.
Others believed they would stay just in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice, agrees.
During the war, the - it was, as a German from ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice, joined the navy in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war, he was captured by the British and placed in the capture of the camp Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to him that he teach them Czech.
"They believed that once back home, Czech would benefit them," said Chalupa.
None of the captured Germans living in Czechoslovakia before the war felt, he said, that following the Bene≈° Decrees, it would be expelled from the republic.
You do not think - you pay!
An emotional campaign attack drivers.
The action against the most expensive road safety in the Czech history.
One way to characterize the emotive media campaign that intends to launch on Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
The Office of the Minister Ale≈° ≈òeb√≠ƒçek believes it will discourage drivers of dangerous driving behavior.
The campaign cost 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and drunk driving.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
She especially wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What appears in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack the emotions.
Also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign.
You do not think - you pay!
The phrase "You do not think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
Then, in a pool of blood, there is the phrase "You will pay."
What should symbolize that can pay life a moment of inattention.
The spots will "haunt" the viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo - Saxon countries, where one can commonly see pictures with drastic images of accident victims.
He believes this will bring down the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
The strategy of the sugar and whip against drivers.
"What works with drivers, the system sugar and whisk.
For them, the sugar is shown, for example, by the fact to save time when red lights.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
Risks should be reminded of drivers, "said Martin Ko≈ô√°n the transport psychologist hospital Na Homolce.
Thus we need information campaigns in the press and especially the negative ads, says the psychologist.
The signs indicating the danger to drivers, according to him, already less effective.
"When a static sign that warns against danger is installed, it will probably soon merge with the environment and the drivers will notice most," pointed Ko≈ô√°n.
Olmert would make peace in exchange for almost all the occupied territories.
Ehud Olmert, the President of the Provisional Government of Israel, decided in favor of the restitution of practically all territories occupied in 1967, thus including the West Bank, Jerusalem - East and the Golan Heights in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means it will be necessary to make almost all the territories (occupied), if not all," said Olmert everyday.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), since without it, peace will not happen," he added.
He admitted that can include restitution Jerusalem - East.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem, and especially does not want tractors and bulldozers crush his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will relinquish parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noticed referring to two attacks in the city in July, during which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Temple Mount, sacred and historic sites" located inside the Old City.
"Whoever would maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That will not work, "he emphasized afterwards.
Retreat of the Golan Heights.
Olmert also ruled in favor of the retreat of Israel from the Golan Heights, which is, he said, an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a retreat from the Golan," he reported.
"The Syrians know very well what they are going to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (Hezbollah); they will have to give up the constant supports they give Hamas terrorism (Hezbollah), Al - Kaida (terrorist network), as well as that of the jihad (holy war) in Iraq, "the prime minister clarified .
Questions that arise after the accident: The stewards are on the bus - they illegal?
The law ignores; walking into a long-distance bus is prohibited.
In the context of the tragic accident of the bus of the company Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can move during the journey inside the bus.
"If we wanted to respect the strict and formal law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the Law on Road Traffic," said the door - Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka transport.
The accident, during which a hostess died aged 22, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the path of the bus.
The girl appeared at that time unfortunately sitting next to the driver on the most dangerous vehicle seat, although it has at its disposal two seats.
But the coach can have an accident or slow abruptly, also when the steward serves coffee or distributes newspapers.
What matters is whether the coach is under the technical sheet equipped with standing room or not.
If this equipment to standing room is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
Long distance Student Agency coaches do not have standing room; This was confirmed by the Aktu√°lnƒõ.cz company director Radim Janƒçura.
"This is an issue we dealt with the Ministry and, at first, it prohibits passengers travel.
Then they canceled and we got that passengers can go to the bathroom during the journey, provided they have their own seat, "he unveiled his position.
The law ignores the steward.
"There is no unambiguous legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal requirement only deals that role.
Furthermore, no legal requirement does not prohibit the carrier to offer services.
The law on road transport only knows the term vehicle recipient; it does not define its rights and duties, "adds more ambiguity holder - Hanzelka word.
Josef Pokorn√Ω, director of the department of vehicular traffic, said on the contrary, that the law sufficiently address the problem.
"Everything depends on whether the coach has in his approval permission to offer standing room.
Everything lies there - in it, "says - it.
Buses are divided into urban, where there is standing room and limited maximum speed, long distance with standing room and a higher speed limit and no long distance buses instead standing with the highest speed limit and seats equipped with safety belts.
As the plane, says an expert.
Jaroslav Ho≈ô√≠n, expert BESIP (traffic safety) Security in transport, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"During a regular flow, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of the service in aircraft.
Again, it is not certain when turbulence will occur and the stewardess can hit their head. "
"But if the bus would have slowed abruptly, the laws of physics would obviously valid.
In the same way that in a city bus or a tram.
The carrier must manage security stewards through internal regulations, "said - and he also believes that the point of view of the law, the issue is not resolved.
Janƒçura is ready to remove these services.
Student Agency bus is the only carrier to offer the stewards services.
He hires two percent.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their job as a profession at risk.
"However, once I have the impression that it is a risky business, I will delete.
Passengers can get their coffee and newspaper in embarkation.
This will also reduce the costs, "says - it.
Security concern is the reason given to the absence of stewards in his vehicles director of the Asiana Alexei Litvin, which ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We have no hostesses. We oppose it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident, "he said, there was one, to T√Ωden.cz ..
An immense tragedy occurred.
A young hostess of the Plze≈à Region, who worked for the company for two years, died in the accident on the line of Naples.
Slovenian truck probably antiquity the emergency lane without using a flash and it blocked the way to the bus.
The driver of the latter to try to avoid it by a sudden maneuver, but it was close by his right side.
Janƒçura denies that the two seats reserved for the rest of the flight attendants were sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to book these seats, they are blocked."
The company has a complaint against the truck driver.
Compensation for the family of the girl, the agency will not wait for the judgment of the court, but in terms of financial compensation, it also relies on the culprit.
A change in the law?
Not in sight.
A change in the law, which is being developed for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide clarification on the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"But it did not lead to any conclusion on this point.
Actually, she is not interested too much in the bus, but the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile at the wheel, "said the expert Ho≈ô√≠n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards as something fundamentally jeopardize passenger safety," concludes the door - Hanzelka speech, stating that the control buses security is under the power of the police and the office for safety.
The hopes of D√ºsseldorfois based on Frankfurt.
Big words were not lacking in the letter sent by the management committee of WestLB employees home.
By a union of entities from D√ºsseldorf financial institution with Deka - Bank in Frankfurt, "the central institution of the financial markets of the financial group of the Sparkasse" could be, according to the letter made public Monday.
WestLB would bring a "competence bloc" doubled for sustainable productivity in such a case.
After all, such a relationship could be the deciding kick to other levels in the Land banking sector.
Here is what it looks like when Executive Committee wishes to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
For WestLB, hurt, always under great pressure.
It is not just the European Commission, but also the Federal Authority for Financial Services Supervision that, it only recently made it clear to the government of the Northern Land Rhineland - Westphalia that time was running out in the search a future solution.
However, it is matter for some time - also from near Frankfurt - an any form relationship between Deka Bank, who knows the Sparkasse customers through their investment funds, and WestLB.
Certainly the head of the Deta - Bank Franz Waas reported during the presentation of the figures for the six months late August that he saw no sense in merging the home of the Mainzer Landstrasse with Land Bank, whether the Helaba or WestLB.
However, the board of Deka, each half is supported by the banks and the L√§nder and groups of savings banks, instructed the Steering Committee to conduct talks with WestLB for joint business activities .
Then it could be financial market flow, or parts of it - it.
The talks, however, have only just started, says - is the financial center.
This is not the first time that the Deta - Bank, which, with its 3,000 employees, account for one of the largest employers in the financial center of Frankfurt comes in lorqu'il comes to consolidation of the sector savings banks.
In 2003 it was believed for a while that the Deta - Bank could merge with Bank of Rhineland Palatinate and Halbab.
Nothing is yet emerged from this ternary bouquet.
Only the plans had they been made public that the government of the Land Hessen was against any participation in those Hellaba - one.
Subsequently, the other two houses either was joined, do not.
The Bank of Rhineland Palatinate was attached instead to the bank of Baden - Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there has always been new negotiations on the reunification of the Deka - Bank with banks L√§nder.
Finally, G√ºnther Merl, Chairman of the Steering Committee of the Hellaba, however, had decided against any business strategy merger with the bank.
Regardless of this, the feeling seems to be spreading that the grouping of various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to Parliament of Bavaria passed, a union of BayernLB with the bank of Baden - Wuttenberg could materialize in first.
For Helaba, it is not particularly good news.
If the pressure which requires further mergers were to increase, potential partners gradually escape him.
In the South, it would now be a junior partner, although it has so far weathered the crisis better than banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The grouping of savings and transfers of Hesse - Thuringia, which owns 85 percent of the capital of Helaba, has instead taken a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB.
Would rigor NordLB.
Such reflections geo - strategic however reflects one facet.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can match.
In June, Merl said that the decisive question, namely through which business model the future ability of the L√§nder banks should be ensured, had not been previously resolved by the German group of savings banks and transfers.
Eventually, a butchering of WestLB could take place, butchering, which here is obviously not desired.
This is also referred to this in the letter of the Management Committee in place: in any case, would be covered a 'comprehensive solution' to the institution.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with Deta - Bank remains to be seen.
The second week - end of the beer festival is also known as the week - end Italian.
For Elena, it's the first time for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies as a girlfriend, and therefore nothing is the same, says - it.
Behind them, near a five-liter barrel of beer Kaiser brand stands a well built bearded man who shows about 200 visitors to the beer festival which deep sounds his throat may occur.
Elena first tape Luca, then kisses him.
Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, the bus station near the Puorta nueva station, four buses are tonight starting at 23:45, 'destinazione Monaco, festa della birra' arrival at 6:30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italian in a bus traveling from br√©silens exclusively.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South - American singing golds already beside their flag, they have already celebrated last night.
And as noisy, says Marco Guarda, this is not for Italian.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat lined with faux fur and glasses with broad silver mounts.
For five years, they go to the Oktoberfest, already three trips this year alone.
They go at night, stay the day at the party, and go to 22:30.
Y overnight involve unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including welcome drink with Kaiser beer, brewed according to the Bavarian Purity Law, health insurance and an official of the German-speaking group - Marco did a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses run at night on the Autostrada direction 'Brenner'.
There is no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes quiet in the bus, passengers are sleeping.
That's better, they will still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while many other bus with registration plates of Italian are once again a break shortly before Munich on Highway 8.
When at dawn, the Marco group finally arrives at six-thirty as planned on the parking near the square Theresa, about 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a last speech, explains the plan of attack.
First: her hair the little yellow cap.
Above is written left 'Oktoberfest' in Gothic, and next the internet address of the travel agency Marco 'conoscersiviaggiando.it. "
Second: 'When the doors of the beer tent open, there is a' Marco shouts into the morning.
'Run! 'Run and reserve seats at the back of the tent.
'Not in front, otherwise it crashes, not all yellow hats on the same benches, we must allocate in the room! '.
The mug, shouts Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And do not forget the set!
'Show the security guards that we behave well!
Once you leave your seats, they are gone! '.
Third: 'Tonight, be back here in ten thirty sharp!' Understand?
And that's it, let's go to the Oktoberfest.
On the way, someone forges yellow caps trees to find the way, panels and even an election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
It wants to be ready for the return.
This is the second week - end of the beer festival, known as the 'week - Italian end'.
There are no exact figures; talking about 50,000 who set off across the Alps and collapse in the kiosk beer, 10 percent of visitors would come on purpose from Italy this week - end.
The Munich police is reinforced by seven policemen from South Tyrol by Italian rescuers volunteers who support the Bavarian red cross performs a statistical on the countries where the Italians occupy the first place before the British (60 interventions) and Austrian (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
One that is particularly popular with Italians is the tent of Hofbr√§u brewery.
Sleepless nights for the shareholders of Hypo Real Estate.
The German banking system is relatively stable, insisted the Federal Minister of Finance there a few weeks.
What luck that the politician used the word 'relatively' and he slipped the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis moves.
This - is indeed occurred this week - end.
Financial real estate Bavarian Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the DAX side, gets a consortium of German banks credit billion to protect against market turbulence.
A person in the know of the situation told Reuters on Monday that aid credits are issued up to an amount of 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the portion in which she would be entitled.
The money comes from both private banks and public law banks.
Back - plan is the - subsidiary Depfa, which bears the losses.
The financial status was, according to a newspaper article, very short-term refinanced for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible because of distrust markets.
In the first half of 2008, the liquidity reserve bank was reduced by 95 percent to 2.37 million, the rate of equity also had weakened slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Profits ongoing and net from financial transactions were compared with the same period the previous year, fell to zero, profits from the allocation of debt and securities determined and the termination provisions in credit operations had fallen by over 70 percent to 5 million.
And only thanks to significant profits from the repayment of downstream accounting costs from restructuring the former Depfa Group, as well as interest payments according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for businesses Konzern the deficit gains of about 16 percent turned out to be moderate.
After its privatization in 1990, the former financial status had initially speculated poorly on real industrial loans, which then were subsidiarised to Aareal Bank.
Because what the classical state funding was not profitable enough, Depfa had then more intensely engaged in infrastructure projects and financing of joint projects between private investors and State (Private - Public - Partnership PPP) and diversified internationally.
The value of the company - daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must provide for depreciation that should have on the calculation of gains and losses group an essential material effect still remains unclear.
The fact is that the dividends were amputated.
Already in 2007, they had been truncated to two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate is, from the acquisition of Depfa, a state investor and highly significant infrastructure.
It is stronger than other dependent institutes refinancing on the market inter - bank since it has no deposit customers.
With the bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of funds between banks has dried up considerably again, banks have accumulated liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for part - about 50 billion euros - of all credits Depfa refinancing of short-term.
According to a statement of the Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing needs is covered with the medium-term credit and now protected from the influence of international financial markets largely out of working order now.
Other sources say that refinancing would be provided with the funds until the end of 2009.
The chief executive Georg Funke HRE committee explained however that the Hypo Real Estate Group should not have to resort to medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institution for the Supervision of Financial Services (BaFin) assume that the capacity of the Hypo Real market group is now assured.
The shareholders and bank creditors have only to hope.
However, given the dynamic and weightlessness of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is also not inconceivable that we should not use the funding to its full extent.
But either can not be ruled otherwise.
After that the bank is, according to the latest releases, even the gates of insolvency late Sunday evening, this rescue at least provisionally will fail to reassure minds either.
The share price has collapsed by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, however, are particularly well.
While the debt in the first place have barely budged, courses loans second-flex.
Most affected are primarily the investment funds of the former - daughter W√ºrttemberg Hypo and those of course who have a life beyond 2009.
The obligations of the bank Hypo Real Estate previously seemed to be an alternative investment speculation, now their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net tightening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the same institute has brought the crisis in the institution by the acquisition of Depfa Bank.
As long as the issuing institutions, governments and less affected commercial banks are still willing to support the system, we can assume a reduction of arrears on time.
Or happen that no hope at the moment - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But faced with renew a partial nationalization noise, the probability approaching safety is now a mere founded hope.
This should book sleepless nights primarily to long-term creditors on the decision of whether they should separate their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use that on which they have drawn a line to form a forward of losses for the years ahead on the next income tax automatically deducted from capital market gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box Bento.
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, must report for the first day at Tachibana Highschool, girls begin to giggle: the German is so "kawaii"!
What does it mean?
Sylvana already knows the word through Manga - in her new exchange log she speaks Japanese.
"The first day of classes in Japan.
What - what - I was excited.
Already the way to go to school scared me.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I took the train 40 minutes until the Highschool Tachibana.
I had to find the way alone, luckily I'm not lost me.
The start of classes does not seem to be fixed as strictly as at home in Lower - Saxony.
Students appear one after the other from eight o'clock until at eight forty, a round begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the course begins, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the type to enjoy speaking in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As I did not yet have the school uniform, I put an old skirt of my host mother and a shirt, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
In this outfit so I introduced myself to the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana ...' - My name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time - then I was very happy to have started to learn the language well there two years.
The 31 girls in the class have all been whispering, giggled and waved, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew through my manga.
It is the essential vocabulary for the survival of Japanese teenagers and means "cute cabbage."
Then I quickly slipped my place.
The girl next to me gave me a big smirk, she thought it was an honor that the corresponding should sit next to her.
The rest of the time was pretty quiet, but when the bell rang, I was assailed by the rules.
Everyone was talking to outdo, burst out laughing and asked me many questions - in this case, it is quite difficult to understand the English Japanese.
During the break, then they all went their Bento.
My mother was also home to me this kind of Lunchbox - it really is something else in the miserable - German cases.
I had rice with herbs, sausage, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and some kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Things have a weird look and taste completely new.
What is certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except perhaps - be salted candied plums, brrrr!
The Bentos are not only lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a Bento she prepared her - even, which is then particularly carefully prepared - hoping to be able to do a little better knowledge of the boy during the break.
I read that in my manga.
I'm curious to know if I could watch it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
So I always replied.
"Because it fascinates me what".
Ultimately, read manga, it is already my favorite for years.
And to better understand manga and culture there, at one time, I also started to learn Japanese.
For me it was really clear that I had to travel a day.
Because I also have a soft spot for traditions, habits and customs.
And here they are given much importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the land of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I never felt lost me here, though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen. "
Rats also have sensations.
Rat or cockroach flees the danger is - it - does that mean that it also feels fear?
The neurophysician Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
But how could - we verify that feel the same way when it acts in the same way as we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions are published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents a series of articles answers to the question "What do - you be true without being able to have proof?".
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else has so far been able to prove just as one can not prove that other human beings have consciousness.
But in this case - here you can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and that we address the issues of felt or general consciousness, we enter the rough terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in front of danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: It plays dead, leaking or attack.
Humans behave the same way, which is why some scientists deduce comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not.
Two aspects of brain structure make the implementation of our subjective experience than the challenging animals.
One aspect is that the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include lateral prefrontal cortex (due to his participation in short-term memory and the functions of management and execution).
This vast area is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be completely absent in other beings.
Least so for these aspects - one of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including awareness of who we are, and the ability to anticipate and decide it is reasonable to assume that the human being is different from the same other primates.
Another significant feature might lie in the linguistic nature of man: a large part of its existence being linked to language, this often means that his conscience depends.
In this case, one could exclude animals.
But even if awareness was not dependent on language, it - it will surely influence, so that animal consciousness, regardless of how it is produced, is probably many would differentiate most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what may look like consciousness in other animals.
If this internal and subjective, can be neither measured nor, because of this particular hardware, analyze, based on our own experience, then its observation causes us big problems.
Most of my developments refer to the contents of conscious experience, but there is next to another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
One could consider conscientious process of animals regardless of their content, and that is exactly what happened in studies on short-term memory of primates, particularly with the example of visualization.
But in this approach that followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the focus is more on nerve correlates of consciousness as the causal mechanisms: both are the same or not.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal cortex in achieving visualization.
But what he then results for emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in a conscious brain of its own affairs.
What we refer to as "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) takes up RAM.
Thus observed, emotions are closely linked to areas of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our voluble nature emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize the states to impute to others than ourselves.
In contrast, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from primitive activities in the areas of body sensation cortex and brainstem, as Jaak Pankseep which, however, focuses more on the brainstem.
As the network has not much changed during human evolution, it could quite involved cross sensations of all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I can not contradict him, but I think this unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear among men and in rats is probably also felt as such in both cases: how could - yet we check whether rats and men feel the same when they act similarly?
A cockroach flees from danger, but if he feels fear?
In my view, similar behavior is not sufficient to prove the same experiences.
Certainly nerve comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain stems, cockroaches against by not even have a brain.
But - that - the brain stem is causing sensations?
And even if you could prove that for humans: how could - we demonstrate in rats?
I believe rats and other mammals, can - even roaches (who knows?) Have sensations.
But I do not know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are likely to differ completely from ours (since human awareness is based on special circuits and on language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior that emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress on the nervous poignent plan since the gauge is the same in rats and humans.
Since I did not explore the language and awareness in rats, neither sensations, I do not know if they exist.
We may consider this as short-term, but I prefer forward rather than constantly bumping me against a wall.
I am indeed a pragmatic emotional.
Platini, UEFA president: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine.
First Deputy Minister Wasjunik Iwan explained that preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government considers the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as a proof of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organize, together with Poland, the European Championships," announced Wasjunik.
"But it is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to do in the two countries. "
In the timing of the construction or destruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, both hosts are running after time.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can not waste time.
We have to work at full speed, "said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA has constantly an eye on us."
An even more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The direction of the Polish Football League PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent director.
The Committee was convened at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN is not able to act within the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish PAP news agency.
"We assured in a letter to the President of UEFA and the preparations for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer."
Several members of the First Division League were already in the previous season, convicted for handling compulsory relegation; in the end, the beginning of the league even had to be shifted at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indignant against - attack.
She wanted to do promotion for a new movie, talked about his private life in an interview - and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan unveiled his ex adulterous Dennis Quaid.
It foams - and against - attack.
A war of late Rose for the former pair Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are engaged in an ugly battle - in full sight of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan was expressed in an interview with American newspaper InStyle on the causes of marriage breakdown "Dennis long been unfaithful to me, and it was very painful."
She became aware of the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - is the story of adultery.
The reaction of Dennis Quaid on her unfaithful husband qualification fell clearly, it would be "monstrous," said one - one at the "New York Daily News," 54, that "Meg chews again the story of our relationship and manipulated. "
It would be more "regrettable" that "the trouble and turmoil that have a divorce for every child are again revived in public" for their common 16 year old son Jack. "
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
Thus was his response to scratch: "In any case, my life continues.
I consider myself fortunate to have a wonderful family that goes better. "
Prices of air tickets and hotels are falling.
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, the flights would be even reduced up to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would again become attractive - this is the result of a study of the financial services provider American Express and travel.
The company has analyzed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and has, after a price increase in the first quarter net profit decline in the second quarter.
After prices on hotels market have increased over the years, the hotel nights have reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities examined again by 6.9 percent on average compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, prices, however, already were 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend has been particularly marked in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent lower than a year earlier.
The causes of this reside for American Express in the low dollar has led to a "desire to travel down American tourists."
Financial centers such as Frankfurt or London would be even more affected by declining prices of the hotels industrial sites such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish town hotel prices are held with an increase of 26.3 percent, a record in Europe.
As for prices of flights, the trend was on the rise in the first quarter.
Due to the rising price of kerosene, economy class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long flights - mail, very consumers of fuel, even increased up 29.2 percent.
From April to June, prices of economy class tickets dropped by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, business class and first class however, price changes were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have grown even larger drop than in other European countries.
From January to March, prices rose 11.9 percent in the second quarter, they fell by 23.6 percent.
German domestic flights have even been halved according to the study.
The reasons for the fall in prices would be on one side a declining economic growth, says the firm.
The request would sell the land in many segments of air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure of competition in the Treaty "Open Sky" liberalizing air traffic between the states - the US and Europe.
Sign of the tense situation is the removal by airlines journeys non - profitable, as well as the high number of airlines that have filed for bankruptcy during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies in Europe alone.
HSV asked Gladbach 1: 0th
With one goal and simple methods, SV Hamburg becomes the first ranking.
In Borussia Luhukay has still not managed to find eleven functional.
Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Hard landing for international player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player did not return until late in the game and his shot failed up against the frame of the goal.
His message was specifically formulated, it was out of his mouth persuasively.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal, 'Hermann Rieger hissed in the hallway locker room of the arena in Hamburg.
It did not happen much in the locker room, half - time was over and most had sat down in their place.
Rieger has been for nearly three decades the physiotherapist of HSV, it enjoys a great reputation like many former protagonists.
And that is why his application was received at strategic places.
The coach assistant Cornelius Jol acquies√© and thumbs to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
Whose orders seem to have been similar: and it jumps with this second goal!
The implementation failed.
"Everything was not very nice to see today," confessed later Marcel Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard would "also wanted to be more relaxed."
This 1: 0 (1: 0 at half - time), the team of Hamburg should when typing the successful head Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players Gladbach could not hurt the weak players in Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," summed Marin Jol.
SV Hamburg will celebrate its 121 years on Monday.
Already Saturday after - noon, fans were celebrated self -, the blue sky above the arena and standings tables on the big screen that showed their club as top of the class.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know to step back," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the intermediate result table reflects more of the unpredictability of the first League that the dominance of his HSV.
The team with late arrivals committed - Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as debauched Jansen FC Bayern - forms admittedly slowly, but it does not shine again.
"We need more charm and more dribbling," Jol demanded.

Dark matter influences the flight of space probes.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon leaves researchers in the perplexity of dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" flying in space.
Due to fuel conductions soon jellies, cryogenic death threat.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon is causing confusion among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
The gravitational support is a maneuver space probes, by which they get an extra boost in the gravitational field of a celestial body, the Earth, for example.
Thus, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
Search probe Americo - European Cassini - Huygens used this physical trick, as did the solar probe Ulysses.
That's what surprised the researchers elsewhere for years: the flying objects do not always behave 100 percent how you would expect according to the venerable law of gravitation.
Moreover, irregularities appear at the speed.
The probes unexpectedly become faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this.
They christened the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that the theory of general relativity, Albert Einstein, which describes the gravitational pull of matter due to the curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was right and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, material that is also close to the Earth," writes - it.
Researchers from space are aware of the dark matter only for about ten years.
He apparently emanates from it an attractive force whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
She, for against, is completely invisible, it is - to - say that it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to calculations of scientists, dark matter still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free.
After ten days in the hands of their captors, tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released and the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs confirmed it.
Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shooting before the release, six hostage-takers were killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans have been removed.
The negotiations for the ransom would already incurred.
The Germans are constantly in the crosshairs of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE depicts the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This was communicated together the Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al - Arabija and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the bulletins of the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and the other hostages were released.
We are just checking their health, "Frattini told.
The five Germans, five Italians and the Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions are doing well and are safe, announced the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of the tour in the desert should already be on the way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the release of the hostages are still unclear; thus, the kidnappers were ready to stop the removal, in the words of an Egyptian security guard, before the Sudanese army killed six kidnappers without warning.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom, "said the agent.
It only remained to collect the hostages, "when suddenly" this surprise "occurred.
Sudanese soldiers had shot this Sunday six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two of them.
The kidnappers had demanded a ransom of Germany in the amount of six million; the money was to be delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The "El Masri El Jom" Daily said that, in the words of a German mediator, the release of the hostages was falling behind because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to liberate women hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men were to be withheld until the kidnappers have found a safe route to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on this story.
Abuse of a father - "that led to suicide."
A court was told that years of abuse by his father - led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57 years, of Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after he admitted eight counts of indecent assault facts.
The High Court has referred Truro he regularly bound step - daughter Stephanie Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7 years.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court was informed that Melle Randle, aged 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007.
Child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had tied and bandaged before forcing her to perform sexual acts, while his mother worked at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 80s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
Step - daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Melle Randle, diligent volunteer National Trust, was haunted abuse that had been imposed on him twice a week.
The Attorney General, Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told that Miss Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, since 2006 seemed "emotionally dead", and "had lost all hope towards life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she committed suicide by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr Randle confronted the stepfather of her daughter who had also written a confession letter that concluded: "I clung hard-and regularly."
"I have not abused her sexually.
"I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise "You are really weird fetish as your victim should certainly be scared, especially at the age of 7 years.
"This unpleasant saga ended with the suicide of the victim.
And what even more amazing is the fact that if she had committed this act, history certainly would never be finished in court. "
He added: "I note in particular, as describe his father and his mother, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
"Without those - one, it would probably now a happy young woman, promising and successful."
Conviction for loss of official data.
The officer of the Cabinet Office who had forgotten top secret documents in June on a train, will be sentenced by the Official Secrets Act, knew the BBC.
The man of the Ministry of Defence was traveling when it forgot two highly classified documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents are passed into the hands of the BBC before being delivered to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any hint of criminal intent.
The BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said the episode was a lot people from Whitehall.
"They will have thought this case would have remained within the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," he said.
An employee who can not be named, is accused of violation of Section 8.1 of the act, that is - to - say the clause which deals with safeguarding information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the highly sensitive nature of his work related to the Associate Committee of Secret Service.
The documents he lost contained assessments on Al - Qaeda and the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from home to a secret location.
Building societies face B & B bill ..
British building societies may have to pay a bill of over ¬£ 80 million to cover the rescue of the bank Bradford & Bingley.
The Government provided ¬£ 14bn to protect the deposits of 2.6 million savers Bradford & Bingleys.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies who collect the money of investors, including 59 building societies.
The director general of the Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it is "irritant" to know that societies and their members will have to pay the piper ...
The ¬£ 14 billion loan will be repaid when the mortgages of Bradford & Bingleys will be identified.
But the interests that are at the same time increase will be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that collect deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building societies are included in this list.
It is irritating to see that the institutions that had a cautious behavior ... now have to pay some of the bills of the institutions that were far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA.
It proclaims that each company has to pay a sum proportional to the deposits it holds, and the intermediate companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the loan interest will rise in 2009 to ¬£ 450millions.
This means that companies will have to find ¬£ 81 million to settle the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Trade Committee of construction companies, told the BBC that the decision seemed unfair.
This is "irritant" to see that the institutions that had a cautious behavior during the recovery of the housing market, now have to pay for much less conservative institutions.
According to the BSA, no society has failed since 1945, when the first record.
"We have to consider all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks, to evaluate options to be adopted to prevent the building societies and their members pay the hefty bill" Cole said.
Interest for 2009 cover seven months from the end of September this year through March.
In 2010, it will pay interest on the entire year, which could also double.
Since building societies are organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the bill either through higher charges or lower interest rates for savings accounts.

This case is one of many accusations addressed to him.

Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh a few weeks, but his party, the Awami League, demanded that the interim military government of the country of first gives it its full freedom.
Corresponding emphasized that the terms of his release are contradictory because if we allow him to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why it could remain free on her return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers announced that it will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the petition of Sheikh Hasina saying that she does not need bail because it had been allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said his lawyer Rafique - ul Huq.
"We will present an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court".
His lawyers argued that she needed bail to return the country to prepare for elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, said a former leader of the Awami party.
She was detained last year after the interim military government has assumed power, but was released in June to receive treatment abroad.

BSkyB loses ITV legal battle.
BSkyB lost its case following the verdict of the Competition Commission, which would require it to reduce its stake in rival ITV transmitter.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The commission said that in the past, the participation of MSkyB prevented competition and allowed it to influence ITV unfairly.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement actually prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media buys ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition by BSkyB, the ITV shares has cast doubt on the actual independence of ITV, prompting a result, the Competition Commission to investigate.
The Virgin boss Richard Branson, a group of consumers and the regulator Ofcom were all contrary to that purchase.
BSkyB responded that force it to reduce its ITV shares would be unreasonable and contrary was excessive - especially considering that BSkyB has just given up his voting rights.
New investigation in the case of US prosecutors.
The US attorney general appointed a special prosecutor to check the issue of dismissal of nine US attorneys in 2006.
Everything is born of the record of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, which criticized the actions of some judicial officers.
The report was critical of White House officials, lawmakers and the former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The survey is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
The accuser Special, Nora Dannehy now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation, lied to investigators and obstructing justice.
"Serious allegations of potentially criminal conduct, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed nor resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine, in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor able to force witnesses to testify was one of his biggest recommendations.
The argument begins with the removal in December 2006 of nine US attorneys made by the US Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had said that prosecutors were dismissed because of poor performance.
But it then emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were not most criticized their colleagues, prompting some observers to attribute to these dismissals a political connotation.
Some prosecutors have been accused of being close to Congressional Republicans, while others have refused to investigate about vote fraud charges against Democrats.
US prosecutors investigate and prosecute the courts for the government.
Certainly they can be fired at any time, but may not be for political reasons.
The head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, eventually accused of being involved in the dismissal case, and in the end, he resigned.
A number of judicial officers of the Justice Department have also resigned.
The report of the Inspector General was very critical of the role of Mr. Gonzales in the case, stating that he considered the "primary responsibility" for the terminations, and eventually "abdicate" leadership role ", succeeding remarkably not involved in this case.
Other officers, including former associate of Bush, Karl Rove, were criticized for having failed to cooperate during the investigation.

The song nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the hit album by Meat Loaf in 1977.

A Dark Street in the City, Often Forgotten and Can Be Soon on Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other side roads, some famous, others only functional.
. And even some veterans taxis and local long-term residents will know how to give directions to get to Extra Place, because they have never heard of it.
The street is in the East Village and runs north from First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
From about 30 feet wide and 120 long, it resembles a dusty alley rather than an active thoroughfare.
. Some panels indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find on a standard atlas.
However, this street has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the manufacturer of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would repave Extra Place and create a smoother transition to the shops and boutiques, which are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers including longtime neighbors said they were charmed by this shortened simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of the block.
But the Department of Preservation and Development of Real Estate of the city that manages the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month - this, at a meeting of neighborhood ownership committees, representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal to allow the manufacturer to buy property on the street.
But the committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and asked to submit a new proposal next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of the No. 3 Committee.
"There are only a few spaces belonging to the city, and we hope that the city retains Extra Place" she said.
"They may offer to repair it and manage it, what else could Avalon, but we want to keep the public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to repave the little street and install seats, some are also used by a cafe to which the builder concede space.
The proposal of this potential acquisition was made public at the meeting this month - one.
Michele de Milly, the Avalon Bay spokesman, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not necessarily mean she wants to be the owner.
"The main interest of Avalon Bay is to revamp the abandoned alley, and make it public," she said, noting that it was the city suggest the sale. "
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation of Property, confirmed that the city wanted to sell well the street, noting further that the mission of the agency was to develop property rather than manage.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a light historical footprint.
Some believe that extra space that name since 1802, when the legacy of the large farm of the many children of Philip Minthorne was divided, leaving next to this little piece of land, which remained since abandoned.
The entrance posterior CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, opened to re Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo album cover of the Ramones' Rocket to Russia ".
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photograph in November 1976.
It was full of scrap metal, rags, barrels, posters, leaves, ropes. "
Some residents, including bloggers who had already discussed the evolution to the luxury of the East Village, have opposed the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãselling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others proclaimed Extra Place as a true raret√©- virtually identical fragment in the city that should be damned in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who operates a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (sub - titled "The Book of Challenges: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Extinction") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small cul - de - sac narrow, dark, day and night, and delimited by the doors of a warehouse and rusty iron shutters, full of newspapers last week that fly along the gutters. "
With few exceptions, the street has always the same pace.
A rat runs nimbly to the bottom of the alley near a door that once led to CBGB, which has now become the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, a bottle of beer 22 ounces empty, lies next to newspapers, which have just been discarded.
Some passersby said they think that rarely Extra Place, and suggested its development.
Mr. Field, for its part, said think that some believed in the attraction of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were held in dark, damp and disgusting."
The Bilingual Debate: immersion in the English language.
In this part of Supervision Program of Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' positions about bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former member of the studies in California, and former director of the education department at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co - author of "not as Good as You Why Did the middle classes are. to choose their school. ".
Woo Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Proposals for Barack Obama on Education are an interesting example.
The Obama campaign points out that "students African - American and Latino are less likely to graduate than white students." it is a true fact.
To combat these differences, the Obama education program supports in particular among many other topics, "transitional bilingual education" for those who are learning English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve a bilingual education which defends the language classroom instruction other than English, is in addition to its interest to eliminate the differences.
Take for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students of this school are in great majority Hispanic, and low income.
More than a third of the students, made up of many newcomers, studying English.
Among students of CM1, 100% passed the state exam in 2008 math expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students passed the English exam - language - art.
This incredible success was achieved thanks to an ingredient other than that advanced by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street put on analyzes, practice, constant assessment of capacity and an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and this is an example that Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, principal of Sixth Street, the school has implemented the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
Total immersion in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in the statement.
Melle Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, I affirmed "We had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you were going without his class, you would have had no chance to identify it. "
"It works, she observes," it worked for us. "
Obama should - it not follow the example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate in other schools made up mostly of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results obtained by this school speak for themselves; but political education within his party (the National Education Associations have long bilingual education) and enormous support for bilingual education obscure the prognosis of the response M . Obama.
While welcoming the fact immigrants learn English, Mr. Obama recently considered this question as insignificant, when he proclaimed that we all need to stop arguing about the wording of the English laws.
"Instead, he said," you must ensure that your child speak Spanish. "
If Obama really wants to eliminate differences, then it should consider carefully, education models that work rather than scorn them or consider them insignificant.

Oil prices fell sharply Monday as people fear that the bailout plan for the financial markets, manages to revive the economy.
The futures of crude oil fell 7 percent reaching $ 99.80 a barrel. Mercantile Exchange in New York, on sales this morning.
Prices have fallen more than $ 20 a barrel since last Monday.

After experiencing in July, an increase of up to $ 145.29 per barrel, prices fell to near $ 90 per barrel this month, before rebounding again in the sight of deep uncertainty in financial markets.
Monday, investors are again worried despite the agreement on the bailout, the largest in history, concluded this weekend with congressional leaders.
The news was tempered by recent concerns that the crisis would durative.
In the latest episode of this financial disaster, "Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said Monday.

Barclays Capital analysts said the frantic negotiations this weekend, concluded with the bailout agreement "appear not to have managed to revive the market."
While the economic situation d√©t√©riorasse, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to slow.

The celebration of the Second Decisive Time for the Improvement of the Record of the team.
After spending during the past eight seasons, longer than anyone in uniform of Shaun Ellis Jets defender thought he had seen everything.
He watched the second time, when the Jets transformed a 0-0 in an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like this," said Ellis.
The second phase began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals have played badly under clouds obscure.
Then quarterback Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, precursor to an afternoon during which their relationship took a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a corner fell back and the second, 10 seconds of the half - time.
"I'm not out of my zone" Favre said about all his passes in Coles.
"It is a mediocre player."
"We communicated extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing catch, defense beat the Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a loose shot and had 32 yards to touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens let out the ball because of Warner.
The last change, the loss of Bowens ball, may well be the most charming event.
The Cardinals took control of the possession during the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a goal from 20 yards taking an advantage of 34-0.
It was better than the Jets were able to score in a while.
"The coach of the Jets, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said" the second or third time? ".
When he was told the two-Jets have missed 21 points in the third incontestable time- Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed more the second time than the third.
. "Many points have been scored in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, beyond its world record.
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia, has again proven to be worthy of the title of the best distance runner of the century, after beating his own world record in Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win in 2: 03: 59 accommodative race on the flat, Gebrselassie broke 27 seconds his record of 2: 04: 26, played last year in Berlin.
At 35, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career during which he won the world championship or world record for any distance, the 1600 meters of the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, craignant- can be so exaggerated in the eyes of today - that air pollution does not increase his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
Under conditions almost parfaites- sunny weather, 48 degrees from 55 to arrival- Gebrselassie won Sunday maintaining an impressive average of a mile in 4 minutes 43 seconds.
The track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyan, converted into distance runners, contributed to the decrease of more than two minutes marathon record in the last ten years, since 1998, when the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won Berlin in 2: 06: 05.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters, having suffered calf cramps two weeks before, and having missed training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest has allowed him to remain bright, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
Started again last week, and today I had my doubts; but in the end, everything went for the best ".".
We reproch√©- him especially in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia-having too orchestrating his races, avoiding the marathon world stars, counting actually hares as if they were in a track competition and considering more world records as the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie capabilities as a runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1: 02: 04. halfway.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the lead compounds have disappeared.
At a little over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final ascent to detach from Kwambai, which finished second in 2: 05: 36, improving his personal best record of five minutes.
Kamathis arrived third in 2: 07: 48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, was a remarkable year getting the seventh time of 2: 19: 19.
The British Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2: 15: 25.
Last spring, Mikitenko 36 years old, has surprised everyone winning the London Marathon in 2: 24: 14.
She could not participate in the Beijing games because of a hypothetical bad back, but promised to win in Berlin, improving on his third marathon, his personal best by nearly five minutes.
She ran by using a clever strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners have a great advantage, exceeding approximately 18miles then ¬Ω after.
Askale Tafa Margasa Ethiopia came second in 2: 21: 31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenya, finished third in 2: 25: 01.
In Part City, Pride and trials of life Noire.
Hidden in the development of its vast park, a few miles from the sun, the bright and giant Orlando, is a quiet town where the pride born and complications of the African experience - American.
"Eatonville, the first all-black town to incorporate, childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, this description it did in 1935, is no longer so easy to do these days." The city in five lakes, three croquet courts ,, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty guavas, two schools and no prison. "
It has now become a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to Zora Festival held each year in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in many ways, the city she became described- tourism thanks to its inclusion in the tourist guide published by The Florida Depression- era Federal Writers' Project-remains a place apart.
It is also independent, dignified and private as it was already in the 30s, when Hurston told that Florida black rural population was often reluctant to share their true thoughts with the white man who "know us so little, does not know what he's missing. "
Although it is the year of the election of a black president, Sen. Barack Obama, who has also invoked an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain wary gaze of abroad.
"We are very careful about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59, a resident forever and oldest parishioner of the city.
"It must be consistent with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historic model of empowerment of black and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
This is a central point but also an example of black rural culture sudiste- sometimes disdained, sometimes reminiscent acclam√©e- birth of American slavery.
Which would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in Eatonville image born with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through books sincere, full of dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "" Their Eyes Were Watching God "(1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guidebook transformed the town, located just off of Route 17, a road that runs through the center of Florida, often forgotten, that results in terms of black history and human drama.
Bold like a bass drum in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parties.
"Past the road on the left," writes - she, "you will find modern brown and white public school, with its gardens and the well preserved playgrounds which Howard Miller always took care, though he knew barely read and write.
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and all that is for people passing through.
So in just a hundred words, Hurston Eatonville associations to self government but also illiteracy, remarriage and sex.
Obviously, Fodor was not so.
It was not actually a portrait everyone appreciated.
Zora has described the reality, "said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the girls Johnson qu'Hurston immortalized, citing colorless songs, performed by men who rented their beauty."
She added: "Some people did not like."
We always remembers Hurston as a lively and eccentric, who frequently returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston arrived in town usually without warning, on board of a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and was wearing pants here, where even today we are proud traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told, while many mocked her.
"People were always glad to see Zora," he said.
But he also adds, swaying in his chair rear patio overlooking Lake Sabelia where Hurston was certainly known, that "she never stayed too long."
On the death of Hurston in 1960, she was poor and her books were out production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten.
Although it was once a star of literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman from Barnard College of the 20s, she was buried in one grave in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no major commemoration or plate to the general public.
I do not think they understood the contribution or the legacy she gave to the world, "said Valerie Boyd, author of" Wrapped in Rainbows, "a Hurston biography published in 2003.
A crucial moment came in the 1980s.
Public servants Orange County wanted to pass a five-lane highway into town to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main street two-way community.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the western corner of the city.
The proposal was made while qu'Eatonville just was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 50s, the dispute over racial mixing led hate the doors of the community.
"At that time, a gang of white youths were throwing oranges or objects against the people sitting on the side," Mr. Franklin said.
"One lady even died.".
They threw a watermelon from their car. "
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the request of the Supreme Court to forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insulting rather than glorifieuse of my race."
Residents now claim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, diluted Eatonville cohesion and undermines confidence of young people.
"Black children were accustomed to be embrass√©s- I remember it well kiss our teacher in the morning, and also night," said NY Nathiri daughter of Ella Dinkins and senior director of the Backup Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
That lasted, she added, until the teachers and students came no more the same place.
"You do not kiss your white teacher because he is white-I mean that there is here a line of demarcation cultural" said Miss Nathiri.
Civil, moreover, have created space for many more Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who went further injury, as, armed with a cheerful own confidence and driving lines such as: "How can - they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company".
That beats me ".
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker visited the unmarked grave of Hurston and began to struggle to revive its reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway, a real bestseller, and reintroduced to the American guns.
The highway project arrived just as the most famous daughter of Eatonville had regained its appeal.
And this time - one, old neighbors Hurston see it as a savior.
The community began to organize a Hurston festival to show the disastrous consequences of such hiring highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the inauguration of two years after the festival, and many come back in January to commemorate.
After many years, told rejected the proposal from the highway.
"A Test of five-lane highway, extremely fast, a real civic pride," said Miss. Nathiri.
Miss Boyd summed it up saying "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the proposed highway has allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents of as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who attends our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville is classified historic city since 1998.
A single theme library (of course Hurston fame) was opened in 2006 on a beautiful Kennedy Boulevard, repaved.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: six miles of Orlando, it may at any time be considered a back street later during a summer rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(There are now 90 percent of blacks).
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, its reason for being, are still treated with caution.
We must ask permission for most interviews, and certain things-like walls of the old Eatonville church, painted by the white man, showing black men in Farmer Field should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a brave teacher who has a weakness for bright red, still fear that their insular community is well understood.
However, due to the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride is emerged.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, problems and all, no better or worse, but as proud, creative, hardworking, crazy and mixed than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is the sincere civic affection that we hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or forces Police, who need additional forces.
And even younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon of 11 years, twins of Winter Park, seem to have properly learned the Eatonville description.
"Most people who spend in this area there will think," Oh, this town is nothing compared to other "Alondra Kenon said after Sunday mass.
But if you stop and you take the time to contemplate the story, it is a beautiful city. "
Here in New York, all speak fluent finance.
Still, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from newsstands and giant TV screens in Times Square, they would realize that they are not in the eye of the cyclone.
They never would think that in glass offices and honeycomb over their heads, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, pass the worst "office day job" from the crack 1929.
Delivery drivers continue to sneak on sidewalks, with their carts and trays of muffins for matini√®res meetings.
Latin still lag between apartment buildings carrying, like mules, fifty luxury shirts hanging from a yoke placed on his shoulders.
Office workers continue to queue to buy their sandwich Matinier street vendors, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 16h and 19h on weekdays.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Luckily I was scheduled me to work in the late afternoon, as I discovered to my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, twenty people queuing.
Not in front of the wickets cashiers or to withdraw cash or make a payment but before the customer of the service desk, where regular customers ordered their checkbooks, tourists asking management for Macy, and new customers opened the accounts.
Most of those before me, I learn later from Starr, my "licensed personal banker", were all in line for the same reason as me.
Not in the same way as they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They withdrew their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building society), credit associations, and type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that work only in one state, and say treat customers like family.
In the recent past, 15 of these banks failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with a capital of $ 327 made use of the bankruptcy trustee, and as New Yorkers came home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, accounts Savings valued at $ 440 million, sought a buyer desperately to save her.
Office and store employees in front of me, scared of another potential debacle, have transferred money from a bank they think is reliable, the one that makes the most of life on Wall Street.
New Yorkers of any became very familiar to the world of finance in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and its CEO Dick Fuld lean, with the same familiarity that it could have to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed doorman in my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or deliveries of my merchant of fruits and vegetables.
She told me, after my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the market for money market funds.
"I changed, I do not want to take any risks."

"I photograph the master out of the scene to capture elements of his character" G√ºnther Bauer - Photographer.
Neither heels of opening or clothing.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, free from all tensions for relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On the one hand the artist.
On the other, the person.
Inseparable except in private, in these times unknown to the public, where we discover intimate gestures and glances stolen artists who do not care to go on stage.
German G√ºnther Bauer mixture "Flamenco - people" theatricality of some productions with singers, dancers and guitarists with this side less known artists.
In this project, the photographer takes the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programming of the Month of Photography Flemish, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, more every day," explains the designer, which clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but after seeing the photos, the viewer realizes that these are not typical image artists on stage.
They photographed "on the street" are artists able to convey passion on stage, sadness, joy ... by captivating the audience.
To capture the moments of personality of these artists do not do pictures on stage.
They have a personality and own character.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera personality moments of flamenco stars. "
With the festival "Song of the People's Mines," Bauer began in 1997 on a long journey to photograph the singers, guitarists and dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits, through the choice of the camera and equipment, recalls classic photography.
The implementation of different stylistic break with the classical side of the image, giving it a modern twist, this reflects the perception of flamenco as Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots which evolves and surprises every day ".
It's not dancing or singing in itself, but the personality and character of the artist who captivates the audience with his art ..
The search for the essence and magic was constant in this work we present these days in El Fot√≥mata gallery.
Les vedettes du Flemish comme Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, entre autres, font partie de la s√©lection faite √† partir d'environ soixante - dix Photographies artistes.
The project has turned into an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book collection of portraits exhibited at the gallery.
The passion for portraits Bauer led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of old sports" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits he loves photographing portraits of people know them and be able to enter their lives for a moment or longer.
I believe in photography a portrait is the most difficult genre.
You find yourself in front of people, characters that sometimes you do not know or who leave you only a few minutes to do their photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try my ideas become reality. "
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is exposed to El Fot√≥mata Gallery, located at number 20 of the Rue de la Mata (street parallel to the Hercules Peupleraie) which will be open until 16 October.

Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival to the majority of the participants, was packed to Juan Bravo theater.
The presenter of the Festival, F√©lix Romeo, found himself facing a fascinated audience who did not see the time passed during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great sense of humor, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst to read" and "new experiences"; how he wrote a "very methodically" through an intense work of documentation, correcting and rewriting part of the text to meet his "lack of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and his memories inspired her novels.
The Spanish novelist - US acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and whether the books change lives. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure fun, a short-lived experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that - it "affects" and "makes people less similar" because we asked writers "not to indulge in frivolity" and assume their vocation.

Llamazares requested the Andalusian Federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the case Silva.
The General Coordinator and member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to make a decision on the case of the former councilor of Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of conduct for treatment to family members.
"In these cases - there I am a federalist, and this will be the Andalusian organization that will assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares regarding the behavior of the political party that will be adopted in the Seville City Council .
However, the leader of the United Left has requested that investigations are evidence of "transparency" to the irregularities that Silva could have made "The United Left has always defended this kind of business so that they have a maximum degree of transparency ".
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all staff."
"Sangre de Mayo" he dared pari Garci.
Inspired by the stories of Benito Perez Galdos, Jos√© Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spaniards against the French in "Sangre de mayo," which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with nearly 15 million budget .
The filmmaker has tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he said today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Guti√©rrez and Paula Echevarr√≠a at the head of the long list of actors.
The film lasting over half past two, "Sangre de mayo" will make its release in theaters next Friday, which then become a television series for Telemadrid more than four hours.
A great admirer of the literature of Gald√≥s, Jos√© Luis Garci assures to have done with this shoot "a childhood dream" by Esperanza Aguirre, who charged it three years ago, shooting a movie for Memorial two years of 2 cents Madrid May, something he has always accepted when the account was sticking to national historical facts.
15 million provided by the Madrid City Garci constitute a "unique opportunity" to play with the sets and clothing appropriate atmosphere of "a Spain that was wrong leader to fight, since, the struggle for independence led the people to rebellion in the reign of Ferdinand VII ", he said.
But the director regret not getting funding for films like "Captain Alatriste" or "Goya's Ghosts" - more than double that obtained for "Sangre de mayo" - because he could not turn some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valc√°rcel, with whom he has worked for most of his career.
The director of "Begin the Beguine" influenced in his usual way of working on the staging of the actors, with whom he used to say before you start shooting and that he does not cast since it seems to him "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the director is to go to the theater and the cinema to stay informed."
Many actors in "Sangre de mayo" repeat on camera, as Miguel Rell√°n, Carlos Larra√±aga or Fernando Guill√©n Cuervo.
Four-time Oscar nominee (he won one), Garci considers that the three films candidates who represent Spain at this year's Hollywood Academy, "Sangre de mayo", "Seven French billiard tables" and ultimately the winner, "The Blind Sunflowers", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which deserves to be better known," he said.
With this movie Garci does not expect a price.
"At first you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you work for prosperity, and now you're happy to make a film more," said Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bay√≥n gets into the skin of the Sevillian dancer T√≥rtola Valencia.
A Sevillian dancer will also pay tribute to a Sevillian dancer.
T√≥rtola Carmen Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenc T√≥rtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and at the age of three years will go to live in London with his family .
It was a free dance dancer who specializes in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer of the liberation of women, as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and pleaded for the abolition of the corset which prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman that has marked the history of dance in Eastern Europe - between - wars, fascinated Isabelle Bay√≥n.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and it asked me to interpret the Sevillian dancer T√≥rtola Valencia and it seemed incredible."
According to the dancer, "We're not trying to tell his life but to translate his thinking.
The titles of his dances reminds me of flamenco.
Thus, "dancing butterfly" made me think of a Cuban popular dance and "snake dance" some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to his, "she says.
The staging was done by two outstanding contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again Isabela in one of his shows, as he did in "La puerta abierta"; and Professor Matilde Coral, which exceptionally kindly cooperate with one that was his pupil.
"Matilde T√≥rtola transforms into a mature character.
I am happy because she agreed to play a role in my work and it honors me. "
The staging was done also with the musical composition and guitar Jes√∫s Torres y Paco Arriaga, popular song of Michael Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Mor√≥n; El P√°jaro percussion, as well as violates Rafa El Viola and collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Ju√°rez "who plays the role of eternal companion of such artists were considered divas ".
This work also tells, in a sense, the life of this woman who has exhibited in such distant places, especially for the time, as in India, the United - States, or Russia, but throughout Europe, as ordinarily resident in London.
"I wanted to remember because I think that it is these women who have a huge influence in their time, and now no one knows and showcases his work," says Bay√≥n.
The show will start at 20:30 at the Lope de Vega theater.
The publication of "Diary of a recently married poet" concludes the triennium.
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a recently married poet" in St. Stephen's Church in New York, where Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities under the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "triennium Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006 - 2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the concession of the Nobel Prize for Literature and death.
In this way, the "triennium Zenobia and Juan Ram√≥n" comes to an end with the reissue of this work, the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and the traveling exhibition "Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez: This light poplar "which was inaugurated last May and, after traveling in different provinces of Andalusia, will go to New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia has bought eight hundred copies of "Diary of a recently married poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo P√©rez - Enciso, to perpetuate a work the most famous Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them. "
This sentence is the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of Malice" and illustrates the despair of American cinema, and throughout America, facing the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had trouble getting an Oscar.
It turned over since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
This was a hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond all expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to its existence."
No one was afraid of ridicule or exaggerating.
One of the film and the homeland fathers died during a particularly dark period, where terrorists and stock markets are scary, esteem US has fallen far down, desperately seeking dignity patterns.
When times are so hard and no reason to live, it only remains to humans that admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He played for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and defender of lost causes and overcome as the foundation for the anti-drug fight created in honor of his deceased elder following an overdose and creating its own organic food brand.
It was a victory for a country that has been difficult to win against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood carelessly or nationalities or passports.
The latest James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, James Bond found that none died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar winner Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the peak of his career.
The bad boy arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He put us the bar high," noted George Clooney, who may - be the only now trying to break the screen as did Paul Newman: being very Honnet and having a serious privacy and away goals.
It is still not easy or possible in the media jungle nowadays.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married fifty years Joanne Woodward, who was faithful even though he had plenty of opportunities not to be.
"But why should - I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a steak in my fridge?" Had - he used to joke.
In heaven, he attends with pride to meet her daughters with her fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
"Of all the major roles he interpreted, it has never been as proud as the devoted husband, father, lover of the great - attentive father and philanthropist," say - it.
Madrid in the race to host the 2016 Olympic Games.
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we are ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but to me it was the worst race I've ever attended.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, those - it would be a pass mark.
But look at everything in detail and from the beginning.
Errors begin with the collection of numbers, which forces you to go ahead.
This is not bad but if they make you move it would be better if they give you everything (including the chip for racing).
Well no.
They made you go there - only to take down the bib (first mistake, move only for this) and (after a long queue) surprise, there was only the size 'S' for the shirt (! second mistake because I need a size XL).
What kind of world do we live?
Is it that because of the crisis they have decided to buy only small jerseys with less fabric and cheaper sudden?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the races.
Apart from the fact that you have to go early to remove the microchip, the queue was 15 minutes, and more, leave the backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, it is incomprehensible as 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, competitions have started and we had not even left our backpacks at the entrance, but once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, rain accompanied waiting over 40 minutes that took place rebellions and attacks from the house.
I believe that about 500 people have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, do not even will figure in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me which I think has not properly marked departure.
Of course, if they asked me to cite an example of perfect race, the one - will certainly not come to my mind.
So I think we can always dream to become the host city for the 2016 Olympics.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual).
At the conference on Emerging Technologies of Microsoft MIT was presented a new image recognition system and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence has little intelligence, but able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to get around the corporate campus) in response to what he was asked during a conversation.
With a camera and a forms and face recognition technology, this "receptionist" may know how many people there are in the place, which they - including remember what positions they occupy - and listen and hear key words in their conversations.
But group them by conversation groups.
In the video presentation, the receptionist detects a third person, but she understands that she does not belong to the group is talking with her and she is not part of the business.
She asks if she's here to visit someone and she tells him she will meet him in a moment.
All this without blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course this is the future.
Now the company has other things on which to focus, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about it more than a change in strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers were sold with the essential instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This is a discovery since Microsoft release after release, has steadily added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change in strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome has arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is the first step on the part of Google to compete with Windows.
Several people have rightly pointed out that a Web browser is not an operational system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the indispensable basis for the hardware and the software included.
It occupies the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother -.
That is true.
It will never go away but you have to see the "death" of the operating system, not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are less and less attention to the operational system but more and more Internet browser.
Computer is lit only to run Firefox, IE or Chrome and every day people spend more time surfing the Internet than to go the windows.
A serving half of the applications in the system?
Who can do more can do less.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, cluttered months, less complex.
For now, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services to finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The picture is in this article was taken earlier this month in one of the lounges reserved for employees of Microsoft in Redmond.
On the drink machine, a poster asks them to use their own search engine - "Your search our future.".
A 2006 study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not come out in early 2009 but by the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will surely try to launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Phone 7.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android being late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dearly.
Le Fabuleux Marcel.
Pablo Picasso endorsed on the French Riviera, Leonardo DiCaprio wore one in the 'Blood Diamond' Edward Zwick, like Al Pacino in 'The Godfather' of Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the holding the association of muscular gays.
And if we begin to list all of his appearances, one could also quote this burly mustache who lifted weights in a traveling circus.
It is not just a male body jersey cotton sleeveless and tight.
The English called 'tank' but the Brussels Fabuleux Marcel stands out among all others.
First, by its flamboyant name - although it is known under the name of 'Marcel' - that has to do with the sport since it takes the name, according to legend, the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel' differs from others by its excellent cotton by its unisex cut by its distinctive logo and the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) as the most famous vests have in the neck.
But be careful because the Belgian brand does not only produce as tank tops.
But it also produces sweat - shirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton trousers, babies, mini - shorts ...
Clothes designed for comfort sub - clothes.
While it's a shame to wear them only as sub - clothes.
They have too much charm.
"I like to be a young mother, the candidate does not care."
Its huge resemblance to her sister did not stop him to develop his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take very seriously their new activity in fashion.
According to Monica, they are not only beautiful and famous girls who lend their names.
She was there to promote the brand Mango was in Paris at its new headquarters, but as well as the presentation of the most important awards of the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Says - we are you doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection my sister Penelope and I have created for the new Mango autumn - winter, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
A very intense day but at the same time exciting, waiting for us.
On what is your new collection for Mango created for the fourth season?
The cinema of the 50s and 60s delights us and we inspire much for our collections.
I love wandering into town and watch the women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman is - Right?
I think so, but in the end everything comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was little I liked the clothes; I desired to go to my grand - mother to look in the cupboards to see my aunt and her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my way I dress.
The dancers really like to dress up for courses and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you endorsed clothing is at this point where you're actually put into the character's skin.
So, everything is connected.
You were no longer 30 years: it was hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30-year-old delight me.
I find that women are more mature, more experienced and savored life with fewer problems.
The biological clock does not scare me.

The drunk driving repeat offenders will install the system 'alcolock'.
The Interior Minister wants the driver who had more than three administrative penalties for alcohol, has installed in his car a system that prevents starting the vehicle while intoxicated, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was already announced in last June and now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which the initiative is seen as a pilot project last year.
Its aim is the reintegration of the driver by offering road rehabilitation course.
The Minister of State in charge of road safety but also the General Directorate of Road Safety and Technological Institute Foundation for Automotive Safety participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers arrested for driving more than once drunk, took the car.
The alcolock would avoid this as it is a connected system to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not blow before; or when the alcohol level of the driver is higher than allowed.
The cost is higher than 1,000 euros and is the responsibility of the driver.
In this regard, a study in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced to 65% of offenses during the first year of installation.
And Spain it is estimated that this could save the lives of 115 people each year.
This measure is sticking only to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviors before they turn into criminal offenses.
And to facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform may be made by ordinary means but, however, the reform made by criminal ways requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available in the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some trucks and function already has a experimental basis.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote an initiative of the Spanish socialist party that proposes to install school bus system as has been done in France.

Andik, the owner of Mango, a gentleman, and Baron Rotchil finished the evening without a jacket because they had lent the two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who ran the store with pants and shirt - his own collection - and for dinner has been transformed by donning a sexy black robe, was moved when during the night tour opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballet rehearsal room and remembering the good old days, she grabbed one of the bars and she made the gesture of a 'large folded'.
In√©s Sastre did not stay for the visit of the dependencies of the palace, but she showed us in on his cell phone pictures of his son.

The alarm - morning almost saddens us when it rings every morning at 7:00, but it's even worse when you consider the pace we needed agitated life today.
The office is synonymous with tension and pain in the back of your computer.
Stress is the evil of the XXI century.
But there is neither one nor two ways to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the workplace.

Sleep talking.
Some children speak during the night.
I do not bring myself to those who wake up very woken by telling us something that happened the day before, but the children who talk in their sleep.
The first time this happens it may surprise you, but in reality it does not matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep is called sleep talking.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Sure there are more than one who speaks during the night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in life for example associated with an episode of high fever) or more periodic (daily, weekly, monthly ...), the day after the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often associated with other sleep alterations such as nightmares, night terrors, nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting), or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they may also be associated with very high fever, in situations of stress or excitement.
Anyway it is a phenomenon little studied.
The intensity with which this product is also highly variable.
He may speak with a quiet voice with single words, murmurs or otherwise with cries, tears, long speeches ...
In case somniloquy becomes very frequent, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist to see if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to obtain an explanation to this problem .
We have said that this is a benign alteration, therefore there is no treatment unless it is linked to another alteration of sleep that can be treated (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What one can do is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:.
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV shows that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who have difficulty in relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a peaceful sleep.
Once the somniloquies appear try to remain calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and the next day he no longer remembered what happened.
Helpful tips.
Do not wake up.
It is useless because it is unconscious and you r√©veilleriez.
While he speaks, he sleeps and therefore based.
Remember that it is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or to check what causes so much anxiety in children.
If you understand what he says (which is unusual), do not be tempted to ask him for information.
You will get nothing, because sleeping, he is not aware to be able to organize his thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he said, but you will not know what it is dreaming, suddenly pay attention to the way that you will interpret information and conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can query at night to know his secrets.
Even jokingly.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, do not worry, it's nothing too serious, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern ... finally.
Illhaeusern has finally found the way to victory on his land after a long period of scarcity.
Without a great match, the Yellow and Black have created the largest number of occasions and have managed to turn a profit for the match.

The start of the second half - time would be decisive with first two signed occasions Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after opening the scoring for the Illhousiens by Marais, well positioned to take a shot cleared off the first attempt to Diebold (53 ').
But the striker Illhousiens can not enjoy happiness long and will be obliged to return to the locker room a dozen minutes later and let his teammates and outnumbered.
But Dannemarie not know enjoy it and will not cause big problems to illhousien Eleven who just fell a little to "compress" his defense, except in the very last seconds of the game when, after a big mess, the ball going very near the bar.

In the first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House has succeeded another to know who John McCain or Barack Obama won.
Not surprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters declared their own victory in the televised duel which was followed by a third of American families.
The analyst David Gergen believes that the political benefit John McCain, though honorable, was not enough "brilliant" to allow it to halt its decline in the polls to five weeks of the presidential.
The Gallup, a poll published Saturday gives a five-point lead to Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), considers that it is the Democrat who pulled out of the game.
Among undecided voters, who are the ones that count, Obama was the winner with 39% of respondents, while 25% of them give victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.

She has good instincts, "but warned Bill Clinton this week - end.
The septuagenarian McCain has repeatedly put forward his unquestionable experience in foreign policy, while stressing the "naivety" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face - to - face.
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that" ... he accused several times.

In Minsk, "you've noticed that there was an election, do you?".
Youth and opponents showed Sunday night on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislative.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening at the closing of polling stations on the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent parliamentary elections.
While no results have yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the regime of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation."
Some admit they have not even voted: "What good is because they do what they want of my voice," said a youth.
They do not believe that the regime did well to foreign observers in order to resume talks with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
Sanctions, the visa ban on 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of assets, could be lifted if the elections were considered clean by observers.
They have not been according to the opposition.
"We were kept out of electoral commissions and our observers were unable to attend the count," lamented Yuri Potemkin, the door - the Union of Democratic Forces words, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkevich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and leader of pro-European movement because what matters is who counts the votes and with us is the executive.
If opposition members enter parliament, is that they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament could mean space on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. "
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "we must open a dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted vis - a - vis Russia, is in crisis, and we do not we are reforming, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Now we want to be independent. "
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe that followed the election process does not recognize the validity of the election.
It stresses that the participation figures seem too high, and the generalization of advance polls (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way for all manipulations.
"You noticed that there was an election, you query the social leader - Democrat Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was nobody in the polls.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in parliament, those that are best suited to power. "
The silence of the night falls on October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Committee welcomed their success.
The interview - Blood again become safer.
H√©ma - Qu√©bec yesterday celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding, and its president, Dr. Francine D√©cary, had reason to rejoice, because H√©ma - Qu√©bec has become one of the most safe and effective blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, he has regained the public trust that had been seriously shaken by the tainted blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood supply managed by the Red Cross Transfusion Service - Canadian Red were infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C during the 1980s.
Faced with this tragedy and public discontent, the Government of Canada established in February 1994 a public inquiry, headed by Justice Horace Krever inquiry aimed at shedding light on the circumstances that led to this tragedy and to make recommendations for such a disaster from happening again.
While Justice Krever delayed to file its report, while some provinces have set up a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the G√©lineau committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following G√©lineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: H√©ma - Qu√©bec to serve Quebec and Canadian Blood Services to supply all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when H√©ma - Qu√©bec began operations, only 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, remembers Dr. D√©cary.
The situation was discouraging.
By dint of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and field work during the years that followed, we have regained the public trust, "said - before she proudly say that in early 2008, almost 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in H√©ma - Qu√©bec.
Dr. D√©cary however keep in mind that "confidence is something extremely fragile".
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, H√©ma - Quebec applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we witnessed in Europe at the outbreak of many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt - Jakob says that holding the fort since its founding in 1998.
"And we did not know at all if the disease could be transmitted by blood.
It was then relied on a key recommendation of the Krever and G√©lineau Reports, that when we do not know and that a serious illness can result, in this case Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease which is characterized by degeneration of the brain leading inevitably to death, it introduces measures of exclusion.
In April 1999, it therefore refused the blood of people who had been more than a month in the United - Kingdom since 1980.
However, there a few years ago, it has been shown beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode has shown that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense. "
In 1999 appeared on the market a much more sensitive technique for HIV testing: the nucleic acid testing (NAT) that detect directly in donated blood the virus to him - and not even antibodies against the virus, based on which the tests previously used.
The TAN helped to shorten the silent period, which extends from the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
It was able to reduce this period to a period of less than one week.
It has substantially reduced the risk that some donors were infected without knowing it and that we can not detect them.
These improvements have greatly lower the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million at risk of receiving blood contaminated with HIV.
"In other words, this means that it will distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected with HIV.
As H√©ma - Qu√©bec distributes each year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products, it will take more than 24 years before the onset of a case of HIV transmission through a blood product.
I think we can now feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to restore health, "said the CEO of H√©ma - Qu√©bec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogen will emerge in the system.
As recently as last year appeared on the island of Reunion the Chikungunya virus which, like the West Nile virus is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant, "continues Dr. D√©cary before emphasizing that in addition to a secure supply, H√©ma - Qu√©bec must also provide a sufficient supply.
"The needs are increasing because the population is aging.
Cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a refill in red blood cells or platelets.
The aging population also has consequences on the network of blood donors which includes an average of 3% of Quebecers eligible to donate blood. "
Any healthy person, aged 18 years and older who meets eligibility criteria may nevertheless give blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people whose blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria is prevalent, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we can maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But we must renew the members of this network of donors as they get older and can not donate blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but especially to retain and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life today is so rampant, we rarely find the time to spend an hour to donate blood, "laments Francine D√©cary.
With an annual budget of $ 297 million, H√©ma - Qu√©bec provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burned.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at H√©ma - Quebec which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once regarded as biomedical waste is full of a rich blood stem cells can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We celebrated it a few weeks ago, the implementation of our bank thousandth sample of cord blood and is expected to draw more than a thousand a year.
We should start to propose for transplants early next year, "says Dr. D√©cary describing this cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed at not being able to access" because H√©ma - Qu√©bec can not afford to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.

He had a nice ovation. "

The Prime Minister does not rule out an election before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Council of the Liberal Party finished, Jean Charest yesterday visited Jean - Talon, in Quebec, where the new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected on the occasion of by-election today.
"Pushing the limits of our last great northern frontier" is the goal in the long term that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while remaining broadly at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, L√©vis yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a kind of Image Mill.
Turning loop on three huge screens, spectacular shots of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen through "Google Maps", maps, etc ..
The great ways as at election time.
During a press conference, moreover, the Prime Minister has refused to rule that would trigger the election this fall, although he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth pan of a "vision" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labor - work with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister recently opened North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, is merely to explain why the North was "a jewel in the immense potential" but gave no date, investment amounts or specific priority in future projects.
At most a few avenues that could be further developed: including hydropower, the forest, but especially the mining sector, boosted by growth in emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds", according to the enumeration of Mr. Charest.
This "area twice the size of France," "This is our home, it is in Quebec.
Not only is it home, but it's us, "he insisted, as if to show that he solicited a national founding myth.
Quebec has many built in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It is for us, it's our future," he added, after a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, said the Prime Minister at the press briefing.
"This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line where there is no agreement for a long time and when the opportunity arises, I reiterate that position - there for the government, "he said.
Moreover, "with climate change, we must rethink our vision of the North", he said in speaking of the passage of the North - West, which will open all year due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes only occupy the territory is a duty.
And the inhabitants of the territory, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially the young.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel L√©tourneau (former member Ungava PQ), have already started consultations with thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Beno√Æt Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place began work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a time when "we give a common vision."
Development of the North would also comply with the principles of sustainable development.
The Plan Nord will be "coordinated, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as continuous with that of Liberal prime minister who preceded him.
"As the Liberals who have preceded us, we thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This has also been a recurring theme of the weekend, which started Friday with a great cocktail to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage to lead the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposed to rename the Central Beauharnois Dam in Ad√©lard - Godbout.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro - Quebec, Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa who made James Bay, our party has been able to shape the future," said Jean Charest .
In the briefing, he invoked another reference, conservative one - there, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing the proposed hydro - electric dam of Eastmain1a - Ruper, Mr. Charest stressed that commissioning was scheduled for 2012.
"Just Between us there, but I plan to be there," he told his supporters, instilling in them applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of triggering an election this fall, what the law it permits.
He stressed that his schedule is filled, however, including a mission from the Council of the Federation in China and a Quebec summit - New York.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader a platform containing the nationalists resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" which rose like a letter in the mail: the PLQ in particular calls for the recognition of "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec appoints members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications and that they have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
The side of the opposition, we welcomed the outline of the Plan Nord with skepticism.
The PQ leader Pauline Marois has emerged Northern Development Policy - du - Quebec that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
She said the Liberal government came to power in 2003, gave up applying.
If he had, "there would be more advanced today," commented Ms. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean - Talon (ballot which takes place today), Fran√ßoise Mercure.
The ADQ expressed support for the adoption of a Plan Nord by the government.
"But what we want is that it is not just a show," said the leader S√©bastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returned from vacation today.
Letters - A disgraced country.
It is Mr. Vic Toews, ex - Minister of "Justice" (ironically) in the Harper cabinet, which allowed himself last summer to say that Louise Arbour was a "shame" for Canada.
Jeter and opprobrium on the woman who led a constant struggle for justice and who deserves our admiration also speaks volumes about the entourage of Prime Minister Stephen Harper on it - yourself.
We are a government that is the only one among all western countries involved, not to have repatriated its nationals imprisoned in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the charges against him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks his word and let languish in inhumane conditions a child - soldier.
The only one that relies on a travesty of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Let us recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among others, argue for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he receives a fair trial in Canada.
This is the same government that condones torture: it does not matter that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of abuses.
We did not even realize it, but we are seeing currently in an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", this word that Harper continues to brandish and that sounds so hollow in his mouth .
Now is the time where no moral no longer exists: one can bully, torture, arbitrarily detain a Canadian citizen at the whim of a minority government until manager (that it will be after October 14 .. .).
Number of voters believe they will find salvation in a party that advocates Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has abandoned what made the reputation and dignity of our country.
Shame, Mr. Toews, it is here, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Free opinion - The Orwellian speech Barrick Gold.
In its edition of September 17, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice - President of the Canadian Barrick Gold mining.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the - it says that the biggest gold company in the world brought a defamation suit of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without a penny in order to launch a "transparent public debate" .
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, this is not the truth that they consider, especially in the case of defamation, but the law.
Not surprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be - it lead to ruin anyone who dares to support a contrary position to his?
Whatever the outcome of the trial, the authors and the publisher of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight, with very unequal arms against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets mining.
Tactics, in these unequal struggles, often is also ruining the defendants to impose a settlement that b√¢illonnera opposition in addition to scare anyone dare to revisit the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate is before the public it should have presented his vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in many countries where works Barrick Gold, the debates in Canada are normally through the exchange of ideas, not with batons.
It was thus sufficient to mining to open its books, records and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and funding independent research teams that could shed light on the issue .
But Barrick Gold appears not to trust public opinion and discharges of hand petitions and letters of support to the authors of Black Canada.
May - be Garver could - explain how he can both ask for a "public" debate while despising the opinions of the same audience?
In the world of Vice - President, it seems that this word refers only to highly paid lawyers and not all Canadians; this is a narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even the critics have the right to speak.
That does not understand - or will not understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public which supports Black Canadian authors and publishers the fact primarily because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchange of arguments, not as part of what many perceive as a prosecution - gag (continuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just Besides filing a notice at the place of the authors of Black Canada telling them to stop using that word ...).
To - beyond the surreal speech of Mr. Garver, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack against the freedom of academic research and the search for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies en bloc the right to quote from credible sources and debate on the facts and interpretations, which are the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that displease the richest companies in the world in a country like Canada, under penalty of prosecution repeatedly, which can?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right of reply.
Academia, to which we belong, has long been managing the debates and disagreements and conflict resolution.
The excessive pursuit of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims it does not want a transparent debate.
This is a loss for academia, as well as for public debate in Canada, and it is time that governments put in place measures to limit this kind of malicious prosecution.
Rescue of Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans agree.
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 30s.
The new version of the plan of 700 billion US dollars to curb the financial crisis gripping Wall Street for months has yet to be ratified by both houses of Congress.
It provides for: better control by elected its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure repayment of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as control over the salaries paid to executives of companies rescued.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, president of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative to the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday at term a marathon two-day negotiations.
"We have made great progress toward an agreement that will be effective on the market," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"Everything was done so as to shelter the real economy and ordinary Americans of the current crisis on Wall Street," said the Democrat.
"This is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, the trauma, chaos and disruption on the daily lives of Americans will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned to sprint in the final hours for fear of the effect another failure would cause on the mood of investors.
The deadline we had given was the opening of markets this morning.
Associated late to the negotiations, the two candidates for the US presidential election were rather favorable to the agreement, however without missing to express their dissatisfaction that one is compelled to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was awarded the addition of certain provisions in the agreement, including that to allow homeowners to keep their homes and that the wages of leaders of enterprises rescued by the state.
"When you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary, "he commented on the airwaves of American television.
Asked another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, responded: "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The outline that I read [show] that this is something we will all have to digest and with which we can move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable, "he said.
The plan seeks $ 700 billion to buy with the money of taxpayers bad debts, assets at risk and unsellable US financial institutions.
It happens after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble which first led to the collapse of subprime mortgages (subprime) before spreading to other more common forms of credit securities (ABCP) and lead to a liquidity freeze and the stampede of banks and financial institutions.
This is a group of elected Republicans who had derailed the first draft agreement last week.
Is believed to be out of this impasse since the Democrats have agreed that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
To round off the corners for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that if the government were to assume losses for five years with this program, it could set up new taxes to help recover his bet.
The new plan provides for payment of a first tranche of 250 billion to which may be added another 100 billion if the President deems necessary.
The payment of an additional 350 billion expected to be endorsed by another vote of Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get stakes in the rescued companies that earned him dividends in case of profit and he can sell when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the ability to delay foreclosures procedures regarding housing attached to home loans affected by the plan and to set limits to compensation and severance payments to executives of companies affected.
The architects of the plan would see voted on by the House of Representatives today, and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite their best efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Voices have indeed continued to rise yesterday against it in both the Democrat Republican camp.
"Obviously, Washington does not hear you," said to the address of his constituents the Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Committee on the House Finance.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not one that is to take advantage of taxpayers. "
Leader of a small group in Congress dubbed "the caucus of the skeptics," Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but reaches the same conclusion.
"Four hundred prominent professors of economics, including three Nobel Prize, wrote in to say: we ask the Congress not to hurry and to examine carefully the way forward," he said yesterday.
Meanwhile, in Europe, there was a further proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands - the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas has indicated that it would not acquire its rival in full sinking since she lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US) in the crisis of subprime States - States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"It is not money lost, said yesterday the Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos.
In exchange, we get voting rights in the bank and influence.
It is precisely something that investors and households appreciate now that uncertain times ahead. "
Meanwhile, the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed on track to nationalize another bank battered by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would resume its consideration of all outstanding loans in the bank Bradford and Bringley, more than 41 billion (75.5 billion US) home loans.
Spanish bank Santander said yesterday that it was she who would buy branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock, the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925 - 2008) - Death of a committed icon.
Its beauty with blue eyes was long his trump card, some would say his weakness.
Had - he released the narcissistic mirror, the American actor in charming smile?
Yes and no.
Her modesty, sensitivity and talent flowing from the source will also be away from the power register which gives birth to the true superstars.
But what a great runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at age 83 of complications from lung cancer at his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the boom years.
Less monumental than Brando, who he resembled and of which he was long a sort of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic conventions.
The mixed blood children are often magnificent.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
These European roots born a glorious faces of the American dream.
No big ego, the ultimate mark of quality.
For in him the whole country was projected enamored of the self-made man, the Pacific War veteran, wounded in battle, which in the early 50's studied drama at Yale and attended the Actor's Studio in New York before to triumph in theater, television, cinema soon.
The same man who campaigned for civil rights was also the racing driver who came second at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979, coupled with a sex symbol, though a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward.
Go with him as the shadow areas of this secret star, discreet, committed, allergic to bursts of show - business, which we will not quite pierced the riddle.
An honest man in the noblest sense.
The disappearance of Paul Newman has given dizziness moviegoers this weekend, while his major roles collide on the black screen of memories.
More than a half - century of a seventh American art constantly changing scrolls through him.
Back shoving remember the cow - charming boy Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to home (1990), evokes his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill its promises.
So many other Paul Newman have passed into history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (marked by hatred), Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, taken after his death, that really launched Newman in 1956.
This friendly crook in the brilliant The Sting (The Sting), Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
Player bitter and vengeful in the magnificent pool The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), it will take the character on the return in The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, which earned him his only Oscar in 1987 for nine nominations.
This face throughout the ages, it was him.
Again it.
The times are scrambling across his path.
Young people know mainly through the cult Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, coach of a hockey team unorthodox ice.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen brothers.
With a last godfather role of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition Sam Mendes in 2003, full circle.
Unlike several film legends let go early occupation, Newman will long remained in the saddle, while denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its splendor and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humor, "as a living challenge to" underplaying "judging his too-supported services.
The profession has not always been kind to the beautiful Paul Newman to whom roles fell while long cooked in its beak.
However played less often the first youth that marginal: neurotics, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, with perfect features refl√©t√®rent drifts and revolts.
As director, Newman revealed unfamiliar facets of his modest real sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (based on the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott overdose dedicated his movie Harry and Son in 1984, out of shame and sadness.
Among the rain of tributes that was sweeping yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former comrade Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) stated very saddened: "His presence made my life and what better country. "
Generosity, love of life are vibrant features of the missing actor.
By - beyond his legendary career, also clears a great activist for civil rights, ecology, the independent cinema, a protestor Hollywood excesses.
We have seen many enthroned on his hoe dressing jars, sauces, biscuits and other food, the taste judging process pretty bad, though gag out.
Proceeds from these sales were nevertheless paid to his Foundation for children in difficulty.
Newman, rather than sit on his myth will have committed to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these sentences: "Always and to the end, your father has been incredibly grateful for his good fortune.
It was a privilege to be there. "
And a privilege for us to have followed the journey of an American artist so lucid and generous.
Model citizen, in short and extra.
What could well make Zuschlag & Company in their plant in bills?
Soon, October 8, will begin hearings relating to pending criminal proceedings, against J√°nos Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud in the form of criminal organization, a permanent and regular basis, which has produced major damage. Other charges were brought against them, for example, forgery and use.
According to prosecutors, the money from grants was spent for personal purposes, while benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money from the state and municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, was one hand in the coffers of the movement Fiatal Baloldal and secondly, in the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the authorities responsible for the investigation, was touching grant money obtained by issuing fee invoices, behind which no real benefit was provided and so the associations never meeting their commitments .
According to the indictment, much of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they obtained invoices books market Jozsefvaros, while they made the stamps in Kiskunhalas.
For corporate names would appear on invoices, it was decided, inter alia, in the northern province tours of Lake Balaton, conducted by Istv√°n Lados the request of J√°nos Zuschlag.
According to the testimony of the latter, it was required to locate pensions and restaurants.
For personal consumption, he requested an invoice, the model of which they realized the other bills they would introduce, among others, with the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and Municipality of the Capital to access grants.
The majority of bills was created by Istv√°n Lados and his accomplice Andr√°s Ori, which according to our information, was mainly concerned to write the records necessary for obtaining grants.
During a "tracking system", a choice of Lados was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by Zuschlag in 2003, this place has ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members Biztos Pont Egyes√ºlet association.
However, in the words of the manager, could not have been so many people occupy this place, same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice issued in the name of the foundation Jobb J√∂v≈ë√©rt, which later will be named Egy√ºtt has Harmadik √âvezred√©rt, crawling errors of form and substance.
A pension, located Badacsonytomaj, had actually only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night. However, the bill mentioned hundred thirty clients.
Billers to the imagination also fell overboard when mentionn√®rent society Pigal Kft, also belonging to the hospitality industry. In their accounts, nor the name of Jobb J√∂v≈ë√©rt, nor the Hoppa did not appear, according to information given to the public prosecutor.
Gy≈ëz≈ë Farkas, the manager of the company, said the site hvg.hu when prosecutors summoned him and showed him the bills, he knew right away that this was false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a wrong place on the stamp."
He added: "In addition to the form, the fact that according to the bill, a hundred people have stayed there, nor stuck, since this institution has only eleven rooms that do not have much space.
In addition, the bill also mentions meal, and the restaurant is closed for a long time. "
Issuers of zealous bills are not be informed about Budapest travel agencies as part of their choice, but as organizing trips abroad. So, naively, they indicated accommodation in Hungarian on bills to pay in cash, which also goes against the accounting practices of the agency.
In addition, as it appeared during the investigation, they also added the VAT on these documents, while benefits on travel activities, including the destination is outside the European Union, are billed without VAT.
Likewise, VAT rate of the four invoices in the name of the Hotel R√©vf√ºl√∂p about Jobb J√∂v≈ë√©rt was incorrect, since the company's services do not support a VAT of 25% as indicated, but VAT at 15 %. In addition, the hotel staff only issue paper bills, while false were handwritten.
The survey reveals that the prosecution "issuers" also erred in stating that the delivery goods transport by road, the company issuing the bills could not exercise, as his profile was as investment advice.
In addition, it is also defective in forms, such as types of improper invoices and false stamps that invoices issued to the order of a Egy√ºtt Harmadik √âvezred√©rt Alap√≠tv√°ny of XXI. Sz√°zadi Kultur√°lis Egyes√ºlet and Biztos Bridge proved false.
As in the case of the company Ravenna Bt. Or athlete internship Kunfeh√©rt√≥ that while both deny being the authors of invoices issued in their name.
Counterfeiters have not paid attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., Established in Ny√≠regyh√°za, was in liquidation at the time (2001) the group of Fiatal V√°ros√©rt Egyes√ºlet was supposed to have a meal at home. According to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidator of the company denies having issued the invoice.
Invoices deliberately.
Another category of billers is the one composed of those who were well aware that he was asked to issue fictitious invoices.
La Fondation Chance Foundation for Budapest, √† la demande du Groupement de Young Left - Young Socialists, the ETABL Facture une √† l'ordre de la Fondation together for the Third Millennium, pour une de Somme de quatre millions USD.
According to the indictment, the manager of the company Collab Kft. was brought to issue false invoices by one of the defendants, Ludovic Gy√∂rfi.
Similarly, cooperated with Zuschlags the company Biogate Kft., Which is currently under liquidation, which in 2003 issued invoices payable to the foundation Jobb Alap√≠tv√°ny J√∂v≈ë√©rt, association and the association Atlasz Egyes√ºlet V√∂r√∂sfeny≈ë Egyes√ºlet, totaling about five million HUF, but behind which no benefits were actually provided.
No financial movement has occurred, either, since the issued invoices were later canceled, but this, agencies have well avoided mentioning it in their accounting.
The next category of issuers bills societies is directly linked to that of the accused companies.
Thus, the administrative representative of the general manager of the company Delta Trio Kft., Dealing fuel trade and motor vehicles, whose headquarters was in Budapest, but where there was found, was Iv√°n Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment in the amount of approximately 18 million HUF.
According to the survey, these equipments were purchased by the company Cash Investment Kft. Kiskunhalas, which was in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, who Iv√°n Kubatov have also sent documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
From what we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that issued invoices to the order of Atlasz companies Hoppa and Egy√ºtt has Harmadik √âvezred√©rt Alap√≠tv√°ny, and he pocketed them against - value.
It is precisely at the request of Iv√°n Kubatov that Romanian masons created the Fa companies - Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos - Bt Investment.
In reality, none of these companies worked, what the accused explained by the fact that they were not given work.
It is still used these companies, since the demand for Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused and founding editor of the companies acts, he established bills to their names, the order of associations related to Zuschlag, such as associations Atlasz and Y - Generacio.
Kubatov gave to organizations, 15 bills in total, issued by companies Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa - Bani Jos, Jos and Investment Linaxtrade, worth 14.2 million HUF.
The prosecutor thought that 10% of the amounts on the invoices and VAT were in the pocket of Kubatov.
The man even used the company Szi - Bt. Beri to establish fictitious invoices which were used in the Biztos Bridge application.
In January 2006, the Association Y - Generacio and Sz√∂vets√©g a Modern Magyarorsz√°g√©rt have applied for a grant to the public benefit organization of the Socialist Party, T√°ncsics Mih√°ly Alap√≠tv√°ny (TMA).
They got this grant in the amount of 500,000 HUF twice, but these benefits have not been used for the purposes specified in the application.
To prevent this from happening know, five fictitious invoices received from the Company Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, these are the bills that were found during the search of the office of √Årp√°d Kemecsei, the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants will relate the invoices manufacturing method, as it had done before the floor above.
What could be really interesting would be that the main accused, J√°nos Zuschlag him - even decides to uncover the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he repeatedly promised to tell every detail, it has not yet done.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or so, possibly, the Socialists have reached an agreement that in exchange for the repayment of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would only hat.
Today, it is probably annoyed, since requests for his house arrest, based on a reduction of his prison conditions, continually fall into deaf ears.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the authors are not repairable economic crimes roam freely or at least expect their own home by the end of the procedure. It does not have that opportunity.
The psychology of overbidding why more money is spent?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the goods.
Researchers in neurology and New York University economics managed to update the neurological and economic foundations of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be left behind in this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that is why they even prefer to pay too high a price.
This research has attempted to draw a neurological scheme of this kind of "game" using experimental auctions.
A volunteer groups playing the lottery, while the other group took part in an auction playful auctions, while at using a functional magnetic resonance method (fMRI), researchers analyzed the brain areas active experimental subjects.
In both games, the participants could earn money, but during the auction an essential element is outbid by a third, all located in the brain stem, called the striatum, began to move in intensive way when losing the game.
This part of the brain, next to several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self - stimulation" of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is due to the flight from the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, economists members of this group of researchers have pursued Financial Supervisory analyzes.
When those - one, three groups surench√©rissaient facing a partner in various circumstances.
They simply informed of the actual value of the control group product, and they have thus made their money.
In another group, they promised that if, in addition, they emerged winner of the game, then they would receive an additional $ 15 in reward.
While the third group he received the $ 15 prior to the auction, but the group members also were losing money in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is that the focus was at one with the victory, while in the other, about the failure.
In proving the hypothesis neurologists, the members of the team players "against failure" were willing to put higher than those made by the control group and the group "for the win."
"These results can not be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them explaining the phenomena observed during auctions by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only neuroimaging methods have helped to remove the contradiction between the two leading theories now on a third explanation. "- Noted Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when should - we see a doctor?
Worldwide, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, the chronic liver disease is mentioned among the top causes of death.
The patients carrying the hepatitis hundred miles is estimated in Hungary, but only seven miles in treatment. This is due to the fact that patients often do not know they are infected.
The hepatitis name is generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but pathogens and diseases caused differ from each other.
The hepatitis virus, according to the pathogenic genes are spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (eg, contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D, and other viruses by blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal secretions, saliva).
For travelers, it is anyway recommended to be vaccinated against influenza A and B. There is no vaccine against the C ..
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating contaminated food, usually accompanied by malaise, weakness, stomach pain and nausea.
Then develops on the skin and the white of the eye visible jaundice, stools become clearer and urine to be darker color. Healing can take two to three weeks.
Around the world, every year one million people die from the most severe form of this disease, such as cancer or liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B ..
The main reason is that according to estimates, only ten patients receiving medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know have the virus because the pathogenic gene sneaky way destroys liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, an early warning is very significant, and regular testing.
The contamination is much higher than average among a population of three groups: those who underwent blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattooed.
Currently, amounts to 200 million patients with chronic hepatitis type C in the world.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor as soon observation of unknown origin symptoms.
The disease can be cured if detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 by the organizations representing patients from around the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Whoever believes in God feels - it less pain?
According to a recent research, religious belief function as a kind of analgesic, which has already helped to make more bearable the death of Catholic martyrs.
British newspaper Telegraph published an article in which University of Oxford researchers conducted an interesting experiment by analyzing the level at which the belief in God could influence the pain tolerance of the human being.
As part of this experience for the bizarre, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while each of them was watching a painting of the Virgin Mary.
From the results, the Catholic faithful have been able to exclude much of suffering.
Through technical palpation of the human brain, we could also discover that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for the regulation of pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiments, which academicians, scientists, philosophers and theologians involved from different areas of the university.
Specifically, the experiment is conducted as follows: an instrument emitting sparks and disseminating ECT is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants to the experience of watching a sustained two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato the 17th century and the other the Painted Lady with an Ermine by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century .
The researchers behind this experience hoping that the sight of the Virgin Mary evokes a sort of state of faith among believers, while the choice of paint Da Vinci, not very different from the first, was on his soothing effect.
Experimental subjects spent a half - hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time, received 20 electric shocks in four successive part while watching either the religious theme painting or the more general theme.
Catholics have said that the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt like "safe," as someone whose "takes care" and they have "calmed down and peace invaded."
At the sight of the religious theme of painting, they reported 12% less pain than when watching the work of Leonardo.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who has - even took part in the experiment, think the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image among atheists, if you can find the appropriate picture.
"We should find a picture against which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, the Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases actually changes our personality," added Wright.
After these excellent results, there remains the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of pain subjects if it is shown to the believers a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same caliber?
Is - that the sight of a better cause Virgin Mary better results?
You are what thou utter about you.
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google says it can be found at the bottom of people's pockets just as the sky above their heads. He knows where they spent their holidays, which experts they consult and what are their interests.
This is however not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people of society.
While in regard skeptics establishing a parallel with the vision of horror Orwell those - do not just see the bulk of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt said, there is little, the Financial Times that the main goal of Google is to gather more information about its users. This is necessary so that the founders of Google can respect their original purpose which sounded as follows: "Let us gather in a system all the world's information".
According to the Google executive questioned, after ten years of a global upheaval of work, they are still at the beginning of their aims to process all the information.
To the question: what he will have in five years? Schmidt said he would like Google to answer questions like "What could - I do tomorrow?" or "What is the work that would suit me best?". However, the software will not be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first glance, as the day they will know enough about users.
It is perfectly clear to anyone on the Internet that the words used in searching the internet, the IP address of the computer that starts the search and then pages viewed by interested persons are specifically listed.
Through Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own historical research and can see what they looked, what they clicked. Thanks to this, long-term, Recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to provide more personalized answers and submit our products and services based on our previous statements and our registered preferences.
That it happens if someone uses my data against me, if he looks at what is my job? ask users who worry indicator information Google monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by the company that can arouse fear, not remorse, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the revolt against the power may raise among Internet users against a - reaction.
It is a fact however confirmed that the search terms are not only recorded but in justified cases, they are sent to a third party, and in such legal cases nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most shining example of recent times is probably coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google sent the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, allowing identification.
Internet users concerned about human rights could breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, arm in arm with the Electronic legal protection agency EFF, proved its rights in court against the FBI. According to the judgment, in the future, Google will still not be bound by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information on the secret FBI request of any nature whatsoever.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and search terms 1000 he won against the strengthening of the law on the protection of the child, voted several years ago. But in the end account, it fails to obtain lists of searches of private users or the entire list of websites and words. - key the last two months).
The judgment of Google is quite contradictory: it is criticized by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and private sphere suffer when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt against manifest that multinational corporations proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and "savages" bringing together enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see Google's next generation of big business, the "connected corporation", for opposition to his rival, Microsoft, labeled as invaders of the world because of Windows, even if both are fighting for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require its user identification code, do not ask for money for its applications. Documentary code and program package, continuously updated, has a much more accessible because more youthful and cool, at the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may be that geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what Web 2.0, the key word as proclaimed in recent years, precisely pulls behind him.
In fact, Web 2.0 is not about anything other than collaboration, the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use the communication channels available to us, and as the size of those - it changes one by one, essentially remains the same: we are exposed.
A young, in general, can keep a profile on various public pages of Facebook Xanga, and it can even connect them - one for other benefits, such as to Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits . Then it can connect those - it to a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These youth may also hold blogs, where automatically appear their latest photo galleries they store on Flickr or Picasa.
While they may be aware of many examples, such as the girlfriend that easily understands view pictures in the morning, taken by the circle of mutual friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening or that of the company laid off an employee, just for the sincere opinions that - has written on his blog about the top management, we can be sure of one thing: the term privacy is totally reconsider today.
He who lives an online life consists of what it shows him - even, and that is how the principle can be defined hiding behind the behavior of today's youth.
He wants to hide something, or at least wants to try to bypass Google's monopoly, can do (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace ).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, not the least. Google online services, to word processing to image processing, reading information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not related to huge server farms and who assemble not our best profile, which existed until now.
The public expects, without really hide, when Google will unveil its true nature.
The company with its current value of $ 156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($ 140 billion), Intel ($ 124 billion) and Coca - Cola ($ 110 billion). Advertising areas AdWords / AdSense threaten sales of advertising agencies, while benefits introduced at an ever faster rate cause serious headaches not only Microsoft, but many other creators of computer programs.
However, critical observers are beside all this, contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the top management of the company refused, in its entirety, employee protests, after it doubled the price Business maternal and after the company has deemed too expensive daily multiple restoration, making anytime. All this pales beside the fact that already in 2006, Google has acquiesced to the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the company detects all results that offend good taste, and the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to the internal rules of the company, the new services are not advertised when they can be used. What is on is that in the months and years ahead, they will move the world with new issues. While some think that the draft scan and archive of books and magazines Google takes so important dimensions that the company will soon be faced with the Supreme Court of states - the United States, other awe of his system Health, because in one -, one can build a complete medical benefit from our results of previous analyzes, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google sets up a genetic database can provide a good raw material for the next generation of writers of science - fiction. The novel's famous Cory Doctorow writes with half - Orwellian tone, describes the future in which a man could be so frightening approached anything that through the Google data.
Two miners helped to remove the traces of double homicide of √ìzd.
"The police summoned two minors for questioning in the case of the double homicide of √ìzd. Based on reasonable suspicion, they helped to remove traces of the crime." - Said the door - word of the police Borsod.
Young people have admitted the facts alleged against them. For now, they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to the information of MTI (Telegraphic Agency Hungarian) are girls, defend free.
The accessory to murder may result in detention of up to 5 years.
The suspect's double homicide of √ìzd, a young local man aged 23, was remanded in custody on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicide, premeditated and interest.
During the investigation, it was found that the young man of 23 years had a large sum of money to a man 53 years.
The suspect did not want to settle the debt and that's why it caught his creditor, last Wednesday, in a site √ìzd where he was killed, and the granddaughter of the man, aged 9 .
According to MTI's information, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit crimes on his hidden crime scene is proof.
Police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made a proposal for the acquisition of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The stock market of the Warsaw values ‚Äã‚Äãproposed two hundred million euros, about five billion crowns for the acquisition of 100% of the share package of the Stock Exchange of Prague.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw stock exchange values, confirmed this proposal that Polish were made despite previously, Czechs have excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the state's hands.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state who wants to part with more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech business daily E15, the proposal represents the Polish highest bid ever made so far for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, transatlantic Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B√∂rse made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the new owner worst and did not rule out that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated between 5 to 10 billion Czech crowns by specialists in the market.
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent of investments, followed by 14.7 percent of the bank Cesk√° Sporitelna and Tiger Holding Four S. arl with 13, 5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of the European press.
In comments Tuesday devoted to the international financial crisis, worsening by the day, the leaders of the European press newspapers are already talking on a "second September 11".
"The global financial catastrophe, it owes the US president" - accuses the Rome newspaper La Repubblica. "The president has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised at will - soon to rescue a desperate situation" ...
Instead of a new Pearl Harbor, as evoked billionaire Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to speak of a second 11.
Some of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, are the shortcomings of the political leadership there - that brought down the global economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system is growing every day, and then the whole world will pay the full price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, after the vote of Congress, a real danger threatens, the one that Washington does not propose policy tool to address the crisis.
The global economy is hanging in the void, just as in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations taking place.
The threat can not be ignored any longer - emphasizes the Tages - Anzeiger from Geneva.
Some states may even extend a lifeline to their staggering financial institutions, and with the money of their taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither the financial resources nor new improvisations will not be sufficient.
In the long term, we need that the states of the European Union make little account of their national egoism and they centralize control - over the divided financial markets.
Just Monday, the weakened financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - recalled the Vienna daily Der Standard, adding that fears that European taxpayers also will have to put their hands in the pocket, very deep, similarly to the US in order to address the crisis, becoming more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really handled the crisis, which, like a tsunami, through, through and through, the old continent.
The "rescuers" must not wield immediately hundred billion euros, by cons would be wise if they noted in which case it would be rational to touch the taxpayer money, with the objective of preventing bigger damage.
The intelligent car mimics the flight of the bumblebee.
Which method is best suited to develop to avoid an obstacle technologies, if not the imitation of an existing obstacle detector already in nature?
For example, that of bees.
In the amazing project presented at the CEATEC, taking place in Japan, the buzzing bees have given the strategic idea starting engineers at Nissan, to inspire them on how they should design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini car robot, an auto control system - robotic bio - inspired type BR23C, it has equipped bees qualities, the ultimate objective of encouraging the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During his flight, each bee is its own space, oval, which actually closely resembles our secure shell protection - explained at the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, director of research and development department and relationships public technology brand.
The bee's eye facets plays a crucial role, since it is able to see in all directions in a 300 degree angle.
To mimic the functions of the eye facets, engineers have addressed the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe laser rangefinder.
The one - it identifies obstacles in a 180 degree angle and a distance of 2 meters before the BR23C, it evaluates the distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor board, which transforms it into evasive action right away.
The perception of the barrier occurs in a fraction of a second. Then the mini car robot, mimicking the movements of a bee, immediately change direction by turning its wheels at an angle sufficient to avoid collision.
Unlike any currently existing system, the evasive action takes place entirely instinctively.
"If it were not so, the mini robot car could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and instantly because this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the protective casing, a layer where for the moment the collision is considered unavoidable.
This whole process must reflect that the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must be conducted in a snap.
Unlike the bees, the difference can not go up, down or diagonally, it may be only two dimensions and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of endless combinations that have bees to avoid other bees, in our case, we could use the rotary motion, acceleration and slowing as laborers at the disposal of the mini self robot.
The BR23C uses Lithium polymer batteries are lighter and whose concentrated energy is larger, making them more durable than the version of Lithium - ion.
According to Andoh is smart instinctive reaction that is paramount, not the processing of data, much less the ability to store.
This mechanism should address some incoming signals per second, and react to them - it.
It is not necessary to store and react with the intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilo - bytes of memory continuously.
We do not need memory with a capacity of giga - bytes, or even mega - bytes.
This is the first step towards the design of a technology for instant avoidance. According to Nissan estimates, the system will enter mass-produced cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding the obstacles on his way.
They even gave a baby name overpriced.
The written version of the economic bailout of $ 700 billion, to redeem the bad loans of banks, to be used several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this sum will be spent.
Reuters announced that in new debates extending until after midnight Saturday local time on the East Coast, congressional leaders agreed on existing controversy for days and days, around the bailout totaling $ 700 billion.
"We made a serious step forward" - said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the US House of Representatives, according to which it remains only to agreements on paper.
The compromise born out of the plane, is supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, however, other measures need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, there is no question here of the Wall Street bailout, but to spin the wheels of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday night at 20h local time in Washington (that is - to - say Monday at 2 am in local time in Central Europe) but did not cause a dramatic rise in the stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to pass the bill by the name of economic stabilization act urgently 2008. Then his fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
Saturday night, President George W. Bush talked to Pelosi, then, the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are pleased with the advanced attacks that night, and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy" - said Tony Fratto, the door - word of the White House.
Furthermore, the program diverges from the original proposal made by the Bush administration, which she mentioned that the $ 700 billion to be spent at once, for the redemption of shares on doubtful loans.
From now on, no more than half of the $ 700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the law by Congress, probably Monday. This money will be used first Treasury Secretary to buy bad loans from banks, while the use of the 100 billion dollars will be at the discretion of the President.
The program will be overseen by an independent body, in which the president of the Federal Reserve will take part as well.
Spending the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new congressional decree.
Under the law, the secretariat of the Treasury may implement a combined strategy: it may, at the same time buy bad loans, securities on mortgages and bad mortgages, and other types of receivables " toxic ".
The competent persons of the Ministry stated that the repurchases may take place in the context of an auction, but also directly.
The rule provides an opportunity for the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program, where of Treasury guarantees the tools originally concerns, for which the companies have paid a premium equal to the foreseeable damage.
Paulson said that the law provides the necessary tools to spend $ 700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, be it large redemption of doubtful receivables, their insurance, or to avoid the risk see the system causing the collapse of any major financial institution.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready for the application of the law once it is signed" - he added.
However, bank managers being in poor posture and pending state aid can expect that their severance, simply called golden parachute over - Atlantic, will be capped by the government.
The salary cap is mentioned only in specific cases. In addition, limitations depend on how the Undersecretariat of Treasury provides assistance to the business.
The principle means that if the cap of Treasury buys through an auction, they will levy a tax on the excess golden parachute, unless the bank president discredited parte retired.
Directly after the takeover of bad debts, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to executives is not an exaggeration.
So that the image is complete, you still have to add that the existing golden parachutes are not changed. The limit applies only to new contracts, so this motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the States - United as legal ceilings will be in effect for the salaries of CEOs - commented the president of the commission in charge of financial services of the House of Representatives, Democrat Barney Frank .
In addition, the state provides a right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the plan. In this way, taxpayers risk decreases, since they can still be a winner in the case when the economy and with it the rescued banks will fall back on their feet.
The bill states that in the next five years, the President shall submit to Congress a proposal to approve the way the losses will be returned to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, there obviously were those who expressed doubts over this plan.
This is not what American citizens have mandated us, this does not protect taxpayer dollars - said Republican congressman from California, Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur think these are the same people who throng taking measurements, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Kinga G√∂ncz think there is a good chance that by January 12, the US agreement - Hungarian visa waiver takes effect. This is what the Minister of Foreign Affairs said in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "now everything depends only when electronic input and control systems over - Atlantic placed in service."
All the time, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.

He will meet with the Foreign Minister, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will hand the decoration of the Commander's Cross with Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will meet with counselors foreign policies of candidates for president, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Obama and McCain both support the bank rescue plan.
Sunday, Barack Obama as John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major US parties have assured their support the bailout of the government of $ 700 billion. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of Treasury Secretary.
After marathon negotiations that lasted for days and days, representatives in Congress and the Administration have finally announced Sunday at dawn, they have reached tentative agreements on bank rescue plan.
This financing plan, aimed thawing of the crisis on Wall Street and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain are the same, each as more appropriate than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, with the highlighting economic issues, Obama has again managed to get a little ahead. The advance of McCain, obtained with the nomination of Sarah Palin as his running mate just after the Republican convention has melted.
At a campaign rally held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress quickly passed the law on the $ 700 billion bailout.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages that he too supports.
"Now is the time to act with responsibility (...) danger threatens your job, your savings, entire industries and the stability of the whole economy" - he said before a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to qualify the economic ideas of McCain exceeded.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: "We all have trouble swallowing (...) but doing nothing is not a possible way".
Republican Senator said that in the proposal, mentioned the creation of a Treasury Audit Board and the capping of severance pay for senior executives, and that he was personally very attached to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that it has serious hopes that the Chamber vote the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German language area.
The right side is intact, it is only in the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - this is evoked by Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country.
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of black and red.
The Mirror (spiegel.de).
In the internet edition of the German news magazine left, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers."
According to recognized political scientist, the erosion of CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein - Huber takes office.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now it is these modern citizens who turn their backs.
This change of era is also the problem of the Christian Democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not entirely a surprise, but Sunday has expired a process that was likely there is to that, just ten years: the undisputed hegemony of the national party s' is completed.
There are of that decade, in 1998, the CSU gathered with 47.7 percent, for the first time since the fifties, with a score - below the level of 50 percent.
This was repeated three years ago in the Bundestag elections in 2005, it is - to - say at the time of the so mentioned Stoiber.
The cause may be attributed to the modernization "devouring his parents," implemented in the region consistently by the CSU.
For 40 years sociologists announce this, but they are highly mistaken about the pace. However secularization, the results of education and North German settlement and is in the region of Bavaria, in development, could not remain without consequences on the CSU loyalty of voters.
Modernization goes hand in hand with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right side is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks, it is precisely the classical groups of citizens who are more distant from the CSU, such as independent, artisans, holders of the tray and the top graduates.
In these groups, support for the CSU has dropped below 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com).
In his article "Who? Who? The party chairman are held on the reserve face questions from the coalition," the conservative Austrian daily deals with the situation of the domestic political confusion that settled after the elections Austrian.
Austrian socialist SP√ñ wish to discuss with the conservative √ñVP.
√ñVP prohibits SP√ñ to interfere in its internal affairs.
The populist party BZ√ñ watch open for negotiations. Green does not want to agree on coalition.
The elections were held now everything is about the coalition; during debates on public television, hardly have party leaders let glimpse their cards.
Werner Faymann, the chairman of the SP√ñ, confirmed he wanted to discuss with the √ñVP.
The SP√ñ wants to show that the cooperation of both parties is indeed possible - that's what already exists in some areas and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the √ñVP as Vice - Chancellor, remains open from Faymann.
As mentioned, the orientation Sch√ºssel - Molterer was, in any case dismissed.
A replica of this combination is out of question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to proposals red.
As already mentioned, collaboration will be unsuccessful if Faymann surely trying to interfere in the internal affairs of the √ñVP.
In his party, the choice of the opposition or the entry into the coalition is temporarily a question quite open. These points should definitely be discussed within √ñVP.
J√∂rg Haider, chairman of the BZ√ñ, watch again open to offers.
"To prevent the coalition of black and red, we are ready to assume the responsibilities of government" - said Haider.
J√°r√≥ka said: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation.
Today began in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted is France, as representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In his message presentation to the plenary, as one of the door - key words of the expert consultation, L√≠via J√°r√≥ka, Fidesz MEP European People's Party, has called attention to segregation in education because it is a violation of law that most affects Roma children and therefore one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened with one hand, Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and secondly, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation, there is the European social partners and the most eminent representatives of the legal protection and European civil organizations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the People's Party group Fidesz MP J√°r√≥ka warned that besides the distinctions noted during hiring, Roma disappear from the labor market, primarily as a result of their low qualification.
"An overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have a high school diploma, and as a result of an elementary education of poor quality, only a fraction has the opportunity to obtain a graduate degree."
Furthermore, J√°r√≥ka stressed that education as a basic right of the human being plays a key role when we must assert other fundamental rights.
Investment in early education for Roma children means a strengthening of the economy of member countries of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to be aware of these reports in the widest possible circle, also between Roma and non - Roma.
Indeed, earlier a Roma child starts school, the more he increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labor market; by taxes paid from income and its consumption, he participated in the state budget.
"By their citizenship of the European Union, Roma must be assured of their right to a quality education, and be protected from low-quality education and sectarian." - Stressed L√≠via J√°r√≥ka.
According to the MP, a collaboration of the European Union and goal-oriented action is needed for immediate acceleration of school desegregation process. For this, compliance with directives anti - discrimination existing and preparation is paramount.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and without -. Job should be given the opportunities provided by democracy Roma children, so they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe "- demanded J√°r√≥ka.
On behalf of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" ensured for all, the Summit goal to equal opportunities in Europe held every year since the summit in Berlin last year, is to ensure unique platform to support measures in favor of equal opportunities and the fight against discrimination, referred to the European level and in the member countries.
CSU: grace for a transition period.
It was in October that will be making the decision on the fate of the fallen duo Huber - Beckstein.
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, heads are not yet fallen, and the debate about personal issues to the peaks of the Bavarian CSU was adjourned.
The party president, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, G√ºnther Beckstein may still keep their place. The question is, until when will the grace?
The fate of the tandem Impaired catastrophic voice of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the extraordinary party congress held last week - end of October.
The members of the pair have heavily criticized, in any case, they do not feel particularly valued their seat.
With this, they have sought to appease the furious members of the fraction and the base, a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of an absolute majority.
There are five years of that - it's true, still led by Edmund Stoiber, the peak of his career - the socio Union - Christian won 60.7 percent, while today a year after the coup against Stoiber, there are only 43.4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "sole ruler" in Bavaria giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But the Conservatives still rely heavily in this southern region of key importance for the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced to the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the Vice - President and Federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor to Huber, also received a place in this small group of recognition, which initiates discussions groping with liberal FDP as well as with Free Voters, formed along the right values ‚Äã‚Äãabout a possible coalition government in Munich.
A foot nose strange fate that was using the list of Free Voters, in legislation between Gabriele Pauli, including the measurement against Stroiber served possibility coup perpetrated by the duo Huber - Beckstein then treated unceremoniously very ambitious municipal politician.
Now the leaders of the CSU put all their energy to stabilize, one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who until now was pulling the strings behind the scenes, will also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and ex - chairman of the CSU, has designated September 28 as the most bitter days of his political career.
Monday, Huber launched some scathing remarks to the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections to be held in September 2009, Merkel will be chancellor again if they put up one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the 2005 national success.
According to Merkel, hardly hiding his disappointment with the fiasco, CSU Field loss will not influence negatively the grand coalition in Berlin.
Although this is relative because it will not be easier to manage the wounded CSU, and the crisis of socio - Democrats forever.
Since 1946, the SPD has reached its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - rivals: 110-0.
No member of the opposition has accessed the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by illegalities committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislative composed of 110 people in this country of 10 million people is going great opposition for many decades before yesterday's elections, the opposition joining forces under the United Democratic Forces name ( ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his term as president for the fourth time when questionable elections in the footsteps of the amendment to the constitution in 2006, "allow" this time - will the presence of some members of the opposition in parliament.
In this way, the ODSZ waived his boycott originally planned.
The fact that Belarus economically dependent on increasing Russia would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the qualified Belarusian political undemocratic Lukashenko and several senior politicians do not get a visa entrance, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus had to take a loan because of the decline in imports of Russian natural gas, more and more expensive, and thus contributed to the passage of Beltransgaz company, which owns the gas lines crossing the country, passed into the hands of the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, in the evaluation of the campaign focused on positive change rather than failures, such as the ban on running for a third of the candidates for the opposition, referred to prior appeasement.
However, the statement of the OSCE Monday already challenged the campaign during which most of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present at the counting of the votes.
Despite all this, the opposition still feel a palpable improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been set free, and Minsk is ready to small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and 'separate Abazzia of Georgia. But Russia with whom Belarus form a confederation on paper considers the two independent territories for already a month.
"We made two steps forward and one step back, but the most important is that the dialogue has been initiated between Belarus and the EU" - said Alexander Milinkevich to our paper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remains so, despite that "power was afraid in this parliament has no weight to bring even a single opponent."
The opposition does not plan to protest actions to the results. Instead, it tries to send the message on the need for economic reforms to voters.
"Of course, we have many worries on that side - there: we need to print our opposition newspapers in Russia, local authorities put us a spoke in the wheel in terms of diffusion, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of the elderly "- said Milinkevich referring to the fact that in the current Lukashenko regime, which considers social security as its main result, the layer of retirees most supported officially no longer considered really as appropriate.
"Because of the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evoking the silence of a graveyard' is no longer a matter of time" - believes Milinkevich.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers called democratic elections.
Sergei Lebedev, head of mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in deeds" .. In this way, the lack of the opposition is that the evidence of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work."
Never in the history of the Palazzo Chigi, not only had a revolving door for entry and exit of employees.
But as of today, is in effect the new measure against the crafty, and against which points will then drinking coffee at the bar during the working hours.
The new anti loafers was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The doors tournantes- tells Brunetta- are an instrument to better work with more productivity, more presence and more services" specifies the minister.
Now begins a new accountability and transparency season.
"It's reformism" further emphasizes Brunetta.
Installation in all institutions of the Council Presidency, supplemented with the Palazzo Chigi.
According to Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance from employees was recorded, assures the Secretary General: "This is a process shared by employees, and we had the collaboration of all."
In short, more breakfast during working hours; more coffee or croissant.
Promise Brunetta, who suggests, smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7am is an excellent and safe resolution."
At a conference at the School of Public Administration.
Rome, the Minister shall only three months, the public employee sick absences are reduced by 50% or more and 60milles year workers. "
He adds that it is essential to make more effective, the Public Administration.
Italian, "which explains the dynamic salariales- the Minister-8 - the last 10 years have doubled from the private sector, and much besides the rate of inflation.
At the same time, thousands of public employees have united to challenge the norms of the decree Brunetta making use of Codacons.
"" While the minister of Civil Service now spreads the data on the decrease in absenteeism at the workplace due to Sickness consumers-wrote the association of the people "lazy assets" continues to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of employees of the Public Administration and productive correct, gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
In particular, Tar, it challenges the exclusion of additional allowances in case of disability due to service; the extension of hours of home permanently sick worker during which undergo monitoring visits, as well as other aspects contained in the new arrangements by the Minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Prevention crucial."
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 work accidents, three died and 27 people who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, Inail data confirm in fact, that white deaths were about 1,200.
These figures reflect the seriousness of the phenomenon remains a major cause of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
For the attention of institutions, social forces and media on this drama, the famous Anmil today in all the Italian provinces the 58th National Day of victims of accidents on the job, institutionalized the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by the Anmil and the tragic events of recent days confirm the importance of the topic of prevention in the workplace", says President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, during a message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association of maimed and disabled workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expressed his "sincere appreciation for the voluntary continuous effort for prevention at the workplace, the protection of injured workers, families of victims assistance and awareness of public opinion."
"Naturally indignant, everyone hit the fist to put an end to such tragedies, which by their size, raise the cry of the media and the participation of the public, even if the daily reality presents dramatic cases even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not conceal that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information."
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector, assume particular importance for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty to keep the attention this phenomenon, do not undervalue the alarm on social gravity, implement and improve legislative standards.
For his part, President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini pointed to how "the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insult the conscience of each of us and requires all institutions to make a concrete effort to end it quickly. "
The data on the rough work seem to signal a small positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white dead is still impressive "later emphasized the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this" trend on the cheap "is translated in fact, a minor attention because it is precisely when the attention relaxes, what tragedy.
"We believe that in general, it does not do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and contrast can be done through multiple actions."
"According ourselves stressed Mercandelli- more controls and inspections are necessary, as more intervention on the training of workers, and this, from the school."
- He added- "it must also make an effort in terms of communication and awareness of public opinion.
"But we must above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers faced with a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
"Mercandelli then denounced" the progressive deterioration of backup terms of compensation available to victims of labor "and" support drift to which the system is moving in recent years. "
"The goal, therefore, is to give back to the insurance coverage worker - he added- so that the fate of one who has an accident, should not depend on spontaneity or enlargement of the legislature."
Mp3 Player singled out, they put at risk the hearing.
Listening to music at full volume for extended periods using portable music devices such as MP3 players, can cause permanent damage to hearing.
That's what announces the European Commission, which, in a statement released in Brussels cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Health and unexpected newly identified risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
"In this report we read in the scientifically note- shows that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listening to music at full volume using portable music devices, for more than one hour per day, per week, risk a permanent loss of hearing. "
"I am concerned that so many young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at high volume, may unknowingly damaging their hearing irreparably" said Kuneva.
"" According to the scientific-data continues the responsible EU there is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
What matters most is to educate consumers and make this public domain information.
We must re-examine further existing control systems seen scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow the new technologies. "
Brussels has asked the independent scientific committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable music devices and increasing the number of young people exposed to noise than - generate.
"Scientists - concludes the EU executive confirmed that there is good reason to worry, and that the European Commission will now examine with Member States and other interested parties, what could possibly be adopted to better protect children and adolescents against exposure to noise from portable music devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100dB, but concerns are growing about the hearing damage that could derive from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to properly restrict this data by using solutions such as reducing the levels and duration of exposure to noise.
Ue Scientific Committee noted that users of portable music devices, listen to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours a week, exceed the limits in force for a maximum noise level agreed on workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods, risk a permanent loss of hearing after 5 years.
Interested 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified at about 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to leave the Commission for the future of the capital.
Today we begin in March we finish in June we will draw the money.
Here is the schedule set by the Capitol to the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", that took place this morning at the new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, the president Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will develop guidelines for Rome.
In March when they have completed, the Committee and the City Council will evaluate the analysis and projects, so as to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"" The commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are repr√©sent√©es- wishes to emphasize Alemanno- it will propose Rome development ideas which can be used by policy makers, who remain the Committee and the Municipal Council.
No overlapping roles, only the desire to have a corner to draw a big project for Rome.
In March, she has finished her duties and then disappear because this experience must have a clear temporal duration.
In June - announces the maire- we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the Future of Rome Capital. ".
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will be binding, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work the Commission will be able to do, and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France with the Attali Commission, as indeed in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics are overwhelmed by the daily management and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, we want to see from the front, and further, to a deeper prospective, working seriously to the development of Rome and its future. "
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to emphasize that "the Commission is not an unnecessary bureaucratic organization or together: it is absolutely free and does not cost a euro to Roman citizens, and will be used to study and engage top intelligences that express the Capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "there must be a strategic reference blank or farm or still, to allow our city to improve, what she really needs, while thinking about his future now a unitary mind, ".
A future that, specifies the Mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual municipal borders but will look further" not only from the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but "also in relation the role that Rome can and must, as a capital of Europe and the Mediterranean. "
Obama? The first president anti - American. That's why.
A famous American politician who wishes to pass for independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second president anti - American.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, because of his decisions, destroyed the US economy and had relations (as indeed it still is today, as a private citizen) with Islam enemy. "
The attacks against Obama increase as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition."
Obama is really cheeky: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that has a total of two governors and five black senators! ".
In reality, it is attacks that do not say much; it is obviously attacks racial, and do not respond to the question of all voters: it will be a good president? We further surveys, which all say that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case - one, it is still someone who speaks from the heart and not with the brain.
A log of the Mississippi, in the southern states bowels - the US, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know to whom the American patriot will give his vote.
Here emerges an aspect of the American mentality kept secret until the end.
"Say what you want, we will see ourselves to the cross, about Obama or McCain.
There's even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed until now, to the point that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Anyway, despite all these arguments, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
We asked 1,500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home with kicks to the buttocks.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were killed, and the US have not been forced to pack.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, the weak point of Bush.
Who will replace George W will have a huge task ahead.
Usa, economic collapse is felt even among journalists in the press, it's time deletions. And many blame the Internet, this "murder" of the newspaper.
Five hundred American journalists were arrested by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists are now pessimistic about their future.
However, they have not openly declared to the attached information, feel less worried about credibility.
They do not feel isolated as before.
The problem of American journalists is the money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis economic model destroyed.
In addition, deletions in the newsroom, in the room where the writers work to assemble the newspaper, are a big problem.
This is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if one wants the traditional journalism as the public understands it, is not reduced consistently.
An obvious but complex pessimism pervades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and journalists from printing newspapers are convinced that journalism at national level is going to follow a wrong path.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Print publication against broadcast.
Journalists have no trouble seeing where does the web.
The biggest publishing houses make their way to the Internet, perceived by many as "the murderer" newspaper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel is increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted to put technology hoping that it "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest hitch in American journalism lies between that direct newsrooms- is - to - say directeurs- and reporters who work for them.
56% of managers at national level, are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is related to the "industrial security".
The directors who think losing their jobs in the space of 3 years were 47% nationally.
As regards the media, it is 30%.
That of the "safe job" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a vast nation like the Usa, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a question of take it or leave it.
The Directors almost always receive huge salaries, while the editor can win 10mille dollars per month, in addition to the payment of pensions and insurance.
As for the holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, spent a number of years.
But according to their revelations, American journalists are often "sick" during the year.
It is the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL: ROME TRIBUNAL, DANILO COPPOLA RESTE A GROTTAFERRATA.
The President of the Second Criminal Section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to dismiss the proceeding of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who asked to be able to leave his town, Grottaferrata, to a house in Rome.
. Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy under the Instruction climbing Unipol - Bnl.
At trial dependents, last week, he got home setting freedom transformed into compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the realtor can browse the provincial city trip to a house in the capital.
According to the court, such movements (the pm has not granted) would allow him to influence his company and to have access to evidence that accuse him.
The elite in danger.
The phenomenon had already appeared there a few days, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the bailout of 700 billion dollars approved by the White House: a good number of Americans was significant, and still is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the US economy.
And that is the New York Times yesterday that we communicate confirmed that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even shared his old East Coast soul, moderate, pro-government institutions and the business community, and his new soul, instead conservative, hostile to "those in Washington" and the world of finance, especially in the powerful states of Central and South.
The soul, in fact, that was felt despotically with the vote that I mentioned at the beginning.
However what just cited is only one example of the changes, the major changes that the economic earthquake during pre-announcement or already let run: not just the United States but throughout the West, can not just here.
The United States and Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena incubated for some time, to the point that, in the new climate, they solidify and proved.
The first of these phenomena is updating the extraordinary stimulus, the dual-class sovereign-state, compared to a kind of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking institutions - Financial who obviously a close relationship with other countries, but, above all, are involved in large-scale, balance sheets of individuals and families living in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for which governs: that is, as a response to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically worldwide but politically it is almost here National.
Political internationalization seems really out of play or, does not have much to say clear evidence is provided by the European Union, shared as usual between the various interests and between the various national, gets to decide no common political line.
And so, it is the Government of each State that all wait interventions, rescue and stimulus packages, the new rules, and especially a disease of credits: when going through difficult times, there is the States that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable to try to put things in place.
They also have the means and legitimation to use them: two resources invaluable, elements which no market or international organization could never have the same way.
This new emphasis of state crisis nation - the rest in perfect harmony with the ever greater importance as the most recent economic developments in the economy tend to be assigned to a factor related to this item enough: territoriality.
. Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that they now entered the realm of the network, the increasingly sophisticated technology, nonmaterial, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized a quick one, that our future will instead settle his more with things not very material accounts such as water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth, but are absolutely related to a circumscribed space, territory.
So, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than the one that is not, that is - to - say, one who has the misfortune to live in a place without a harvest, without oil or water.
I come now to the second novelty that however, provides a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says policy and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, looking for someone who can take charge of the situation.
On the other side, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shadow.
And besides, something even deeper, in a sense, even disturbing: a discredit, suffering, an inadequate image, a sense of remoteness that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number Country of the West.
And further increases belief in various classes, before actions are the same ideas of social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, have the same time and to be ever more foreign to the opinions of majorities.
In short, leadership demand feeds underground way, a powerful and branched d√©l√©gitimassions movement of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, manifested in the "revolts" improvised or election, the changes in collective moods these very recently, from the conservative rise in Austria Bavaria, to the fall of Labour in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the right in Italy is not arrived by chance).
One has the impression that the traditional elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, seems someone always more difficult, which has a long aujourd ay, to understand and thus to represent the deeper layers of western societies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and potentially agitated disproportionately.
In view of all this talk of a current "rebellion of the masses" to the agenda seems frankly exaggerated.
But it does say, keep your eyes open, it is not without reason.
Superglue to walk on walls.
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
That is the purpose of various American research centers and now, a team of four institutes are almost succeeds.
With adhesive measured only 2.5 square centimeters, researchers have managed to maintain stuck a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The study- The journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of those we know who use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of the adhesive can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a pile of spaghetti". Explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by gecko feet, covered with microscopic hairs that ensure the animal, an adherent perfect.
Tests conducted on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and the sandpaper, demonstrated that the new adhesive is ten times more potent than the paws of these reptiles, and at the same time that "detaches easily the wall, "says Liming Dai, researcher of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Dayton.
WALK ON WALLS? - "This material could be used as a temporary adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps for walking on walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but the researchers believe a lot less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, since the carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could involve aerospace engineering.
For now, no super hero.
OTHER RESEARCH AND The University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated also in search of a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal American Chemical Society, the California researchers presented an adhesive composed of microfibers like hair that self cleans dust during movement on a surface to ensure perfect and consistent grip.
Drugs: Never with fruit juice.
Beware of grapefruit juice, orange and apple.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because refreshing and rich in vitamins, if associated with some vital drugs, alter the absorbement amplifying or diminishing as appropriate, effective, even with serious health consequences.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, said the risks of juice they are, canned or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway in Philadelphia, he launches a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple to reduce absorbement some vital medicines, canceling their benefits and endangering the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice has been heavily criticized because all responsibility to increase effects of certain anti-arrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anti-anxiety, anti Stem and neurological up to toxic levels.
DRUGS risk-This is the Italian Medicines Agency itself, which gave the news in a newsletter dated two years, alerting doctors and patients not to undervalue the danger arising from this mix and be careful what you drink, if you take drugs like eg Diazepam or Methadone.
THAT THE Grapefruit According to experts, even the orange and apple juice contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active principles inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence, the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Pharmacology Department of the Public University of Milan: "These findings are generally reported immediately to the various national and international agencies of drugs that will if necessary, change the informative notes drugs.
It is always advisable to read the papers illustrative of the medicines you take, and if something is not clear, do not be impressive, but clearly ask your doctor or pharmacist "said the expert Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in economics to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on trade patterns and location of economic activity.
Krugman, 55, is a neo - Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous columnist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of economics solutions and foreign policy of the Bush administration.
A few months after the attacks in September 2001, during the days of the collapse of Enron, Krugman wrote in an article published on the New York Times, the second event was more significant than the first, in terms of consequences the history of the United - States.
A forecast that unleashed the many controversies, and was blamed on the economist for years, but now proved correct.
"I am surprised and a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom have disappeared from public attention" Krugman stated at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great value", but also a whistleblower style "very aggressive, especially critical of the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the package "anti - Microsoft".
It is the day of the broadcast OpenOffice.org.3.0, open source personal productivity suite that is designed to always touch and more users, home office, professional public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following almost a year of work, performed by volunteer developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package shows the general public with various novelties: the Welcome screen, and review interface and become less austere, other larger, such as born compatibility for the Apple operating system Mac OS X, and support for the new format ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the 2007 Office suite, and it is possible to display documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.).
Also interesting, specific functions to certain modules, such as that reduces the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them by email, or import PDF file into the graphic processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front, it is possible to create documents "hybrid PDF" that unite the typical graph of Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text winemaker.
The collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications in the spreadsheet, different users can be involved, avoiding conflicts on changes in the development of texts because each employee is assigned a color comments for better recognition under revision.
Some companies are even working to bring some of OpenOffice functions on the Web (on the cloud, the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should issue the final result.
The Italian version is downloadable at http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.htmlet and adds to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is available as usual in addition to the Linux operating system.
On request the installation cd can be shipped to home or the workplace.
And if the theme of free can be a way to spread the in houses, it is in business, that Open Office after trying the great challenge that can already count on a variety of projects in the public administration and schools.
Besides the realities that offer training service, consultation and support, ideal for small and medium enterprises, which could also open up to the business prospective.
Open Office is composed of five main modules: Writer, for writing the video equivalent of Word; Calc is the spreadsheet that is to replace Excel; Impress for PowerPoint presentations rival; Dbase, such as the famous Access is the program that allows working on databases; Finally DRWA is the graphic module.
Goal 2008, reaching 5 million download, and considering that today there are nearly 3 million and 600,000, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the projected figure.
Kohl also is positive, it is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity in the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the mountain jersey.
This is the site daily L'Equipe that reports the news.
A 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth cyclist positive Cera, the third generation Epo after Italian Riccardo Ricc√≤ and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also Gerolsteiner.
Blood tests performed on specimens Kohl form part of those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay - Malabry.
If against analyzes confirm positivity Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will necessarily expect two years of disposal.
The news of the positivity of Kohl's third generation Epo, was confirmed by the head of the French anti doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who contacted The Associated Press, have notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The Austrian 26 years has placed on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, and wrapping up the polka dot jersey of best climber.
IMMIGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES ASKS WHETHER ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has recently been transformed into a destination for immigrants" reluctantly received.
It would transform - he Beau country into a nation of racists? That is what is int√©roge the New York Times who dedicated a long article discussing the theme of racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a box biscuits.
This case highlights what the New York Times defined as "northern paradox": the northern regions are both those where there has been "more integration and more work", but also "anti sense - the most immigrants in the country and the most important support for the Lega Nord ".
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants the NYT has also refers to episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislature intended by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
Trend highlighted by the Pope and by the President of the Republic "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinal has asked that the State and the Church work together to overcome racism."
Students victims of high rents up to 900 euros for a room.
The market for student rentals knows no crisis.
The last survey of Sunia, the union of tenants, rent a single room can cost a student up to 900 Euro in Milan, Florence 700, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects as to exclude whole categories of young people, the right to study because of the very high overall costs than from families must soutenir- explains the head of the research department of Sunia, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the high demand from students has distorted the market so that a general increase of process began even for residents.
In most cases, hire deals also comprise a series of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, without limitation rent, sub - locations.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of taxation, are necessary to calm prices.
Reading in detail the survey, we see that Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, we will minimum of 650 euros (Bande Nere area), with an average value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area).
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, you have 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in areas near the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) asks about 600 euros for a single, 450 for a bed in a double.
Slightly lower values ‚Äã‚Äã(550 euro for a single) for areas near the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt√†).
We can save that if we move away in peripheral areas: 300 euro for a bed, and 450 for a single in the predestined zone Centocelle or similar.
In Naples, it is necessary for a bed 300/400 euros for a single, one spends 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in areas Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari bed, it takes 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the city economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, where rentals are often taken by students outside the community, there was a further anomaly: the rent charged to foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italian.
Goodbye old Cinema Paradiso, cities eliment the historic rooms.
Historical theaters close in favor of Multiplex.
"A city without movie theaters is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates what happens in major Italian cities, but also in provincial cities ,.
The cinemas marginalization process with the birth outskirts of large multiplex, and death from consumption of single rooms in the central areas of cities, is one of the major events that seems to us inevitable and undeniable; it more all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often responsible for memory and historical places, "it's like one of my friends disappeared, someone we know with whom we shared a long way and so many emotions," observes the director of the Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, Tornatore film that offers 20 years ago, the first Oscar and the Grand Prize of the Cannes juror, who told the poetry of a provincial hall and the nostalgia of a way of life film, may be lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main business association, want it all: the last five years, 316 traditional type cinemas have closed, and those are the rooms of the main cities that have mostly paid the fee: 10 least Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected by the closure regions, Emilia Romaine leads with 82 cinemas single rooms lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence confirms that the first t responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because those are the three Italian regions that recorded the most new multiplex cinemas 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 Tuscany as in Emilia - Romagna.
"The Italian operations grew irrationally" observes Paolo Protti, president of ANEC, "it is useful to build new structures, but it would still ensure the survival of existing ones, for when a farm in a town hall, the fr√©quenteurs are not necessarily willing to go all the multiplex.
Not to mention the missed deliberation of credit for traders: the antecedent state debt is about 10 million.
It is shameful that an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not comply with existing laws.
To support the sector should be between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about these closures, decided to resolve the situation with the signing of a protocol between City Hall and ANEC, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote the cinemas single rooms of the historic centers and peripheries.
Among the planned standards, there are tax benefits measures for managers and public benefits in terms of mobility: the audience will enter the restricted traffic area, and have special rates for parking lots and in some parking lots.
"It is an initiative that I like" observes Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by implementing other measures.
However, it is clear that to contrast the super power of the multiplex, traditional rooms should also improve the quality of sound and picture, as the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that for me has always been important: the closure of Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso" which I thought already for 10 years.
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinal Via Nazionale, now closed, where I lived as shared emotions, I turn to the other side not to see blackened by dust panels.
Links between politics and 'Ndrangheta, arrested the mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choice of the Town Hall to the interests of the clan Piromalli."
Heavy accusations are launched by the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria, to the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning to open competition for Mafia association.
The controllers also Gioacchino Piromalli, former mediator between the clan and governments, and her little son lawyer, namesake of the boss, already condemned for mafia association type criminal, and to pay 10 million euros.
"An affront to the legal and moral standards, and especially common sense" wrote prosecutors, two local administrations had expressed willingness to pay consultations to Master Piromalli.
"So we would have been given to the judges-clan -√©crivent officially enter inside town halls facilitating opportunities, already considerable monitoring and orientating the public administration."
The chairman of the regional committee Calabrian Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there is more than one" in his region, "there are places where the mafia intensity stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressure from the Ndrangheta, heroes who are honest. "
The arrests this morning follow those of last July, following which the police announced to have beheaded Piromalli clan.
From the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved; already in 1991, and again because of suspected conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of their duties to administer the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of UDC at the time of the dissolution, was appointed head of a center-right coalition after the ballot in May 2006.
He cried foul when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused the deputy interior minister at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing him of plotting all for a political question, but considering the application for committal signed this morning, the judges explain that the clan had Piromalli even managed to ask the variation of the A3 project.
Based on the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, write the pm, is emerged "availability to marry the requirements of a businessman, best known representative of a group close to the Piromalli, standardizing the choice of the public administration to interests of the clan.
When energy is born of the waves, now are getting big.
This is an enormous deposit which occupies over 70% of the surface of the planet and now the world's major energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, are the new renewable sources that giants like Chevron have set eyes, and now trying to put the hand.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the motion of the sea has been studied for centuries now, and in the 70s, coinciding with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When oil prices lowered around 1980, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãexploiting marine energy was put aside, but now conservationists bodies and the new rise in oil give a boom to the area.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of global electricity needs could be covered by the operating systems of the swell of the sea.
This amount would be double that produced by nuclear power plants.
And in addition, there would be the currents and tides ...
Colossi on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 sigl√© an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the deal was announced, it seemed not a real revolutionary.
Two years ago, more and more candidates from these companies doomed always to rely on traditional energy ocean energy.
"Chevron is studying technologies Energy said oc√©anique- the door - word of a company associated to the US oil giant, the Wall Street Journal-business daily and evaluates opportunities to cooperate with us."
The cooperation in question concerns the licensing deliberated by the US Committee for energy, necessary to give rise to a mining project of marine energy in Alaska.
That's a very interesting signal, especially if one considers that just in Alaska, Usa continue to extract oil and recently President Bush has set up a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, who travel the path of energy from the sea, and the amount invested to date, although their details do are known, indicate according to observers, increasing interest.
Tecnologie to make the point.
Experts talk about a technology still in its infancy, because of the fact that marine energy does not dissipate fears towards environmental impact.
Currently, systems such as Portugal or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create a big problem to the ecosystem.
To produce large-scale energy, however, use of technology with a superior environmental impact.
"And the choices are varied: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the sludge upwards and downwards, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside floats.
The pressure turns a turbine which in turn powers a generator.
Energy is sent to shore through underwater cables.
For now, we have four such systems in the design stage, pending a single federal approval and part of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the contrary, already produces energy for a commercial center and a parking lot using six marine turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movement during tide, rotates the turbine blades, creating a rotational movement which powers a generator.
Verdant announced that a long list of customers waiting permissions to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
Of particular interest, say - they at the Institute for Research of electric power, deserves this moment, the potential of the tides.
Although this is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely on tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, look to the coast, invested 7 million and a half dollars in 2008 and provides investment up to 35 million in 2009.
Barack Obama is the fourth US president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
US President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours to be the fourth American president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The diploma, medal and a check for $ 1.4 million will be forgiven among others for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between nations.

The tour will reach its pinnacle in the post - twelve o'clock at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
It will be the fourth US president to receive it, but only the third who will be awarded the prize in the chamber - even the Committee.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would speak of the war in Afghanistan at the award ceremony.
The president does not want to avoid this because he is aware that he receives this award is a president who is fighting a war in two countries at present.
It strengthened the war effort still has a few days by sending additional units in Afghanistan, none of his critics forget to stress.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check for ten million Swedish kronor (approximately ‚Ç¨ 1.1 million).
It has to donate it to charity, but he has not yet decided which concretely.
His busy schedule takes him then and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at this price in the beginning.
He mentioned, for example, have the feeling of not deserving the fullest.
He also repeated several times that it is not a prize for himself, but for all those who defend the same values.
Since the announcement, he said it would be for him a "call to action".
A conservationist charged with blackmail.
Police Litomƒõ≈ôice indicted blackmail the president of the association Society of conservationists Litomƒõ≈ôice.
Several times last year he called for several construction sites of procedures and asked for money from investors for his personal benefit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romov√° door - speech Litomƒõ≈ôice police.
The president of the Society of conservationists Litomƒõ≈ôice is Lubom√≠r Studniƒçka.
He is currently in custody and faces up to three years imprisonment.
Waste sorting bins are not the perfume in Brno.
In Prague everyone can sort the beverage packaging, while in the South Moravian villages you come across sorting bins on every street corner.
And Brno?
There he would have to take several minutes to find appropriate bins.
I will not say we do not would sort all waste at Brno.
But I feel that the councilors of our city, the second largest city in the country are not interested enough to this problem.
Brno is in the stone age of waste sorting not only because citizens can not even sort as paper, glass and PVC, but especially given the number of trucks dedicated to waste.
Have - you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle in the center - city?
It is a science, which mainly takes time and nerves of steel.
The only place I've found for the moment, it is the place of Moravia in front of Potrefena Husa.
Monsieur Onderka and his colleagues do not want me, but it seems pretty damn low.
Not to mention the fact that in other areas of the city that is not an easy task either.
And finally, many of my friends do not sort their waste.
Laziness.
That makes them a trek to get to the dumpsters.
It does not surprise me from them.
Me - even after a party, I offered to go and have a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except that I saw no color bucket Kounicova street.
Fortunately I - I found the right place on my way to the tram.
That said, the waste overflowed.
This is after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the best the city, right? !
It's probably that ecology and aesthetics claimed not interested too socialist Brno.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first hockey league that shames the city in the country, instead of buying a few extra buckets and propose sorting more raw materials for Brno cleaner.
I'm glad I could strengthen my impression with official statistics after dragging a while on the internet.
According to data of EKO - KOM, Brno is really the worst in the South Moravian region.
Budget Paroubek removed from the argentaux pensions and sick leave.
After that the left has increased, despite the opinion of the government, farmers or officials it may lack money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for the interest on government debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of who governs in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When social - democrats and communists imposed the increase for some classes, they were based on the fact that the government will borrow for sensitive spending, pensions and sick leave. "It is only put the problems to later undermine the ground," said Janota.
You should know that on borrowed money interest payable are becoming higher and it will return sooner or later.
The state does not really have a choice about where to draw the money.
If he does not give or welfare spending, it will have to raise taxes.
To all those that the left has now increased: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And subsequently, to their children.
People affect them and should not fear for their pensions or their health insurers, of which 1.8 billion has disappeared.
But at the expense of more government debt - next year so do not miss 163 billion into the coffers, but more.
Despite the efforts of the Minister Janota debt will grow by more quickly and with it, interest expenditures.
The state is going to need money to pay back and it will no longer suffice to slightly increase or decrease VAT maternity leave as did the Government in its anti pack - deficit.
He will also be missed five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to some groups of voters.
This mainly sections already decided and initiated which it is not possible to change the project to eventually reduce costs.
At most keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or halting thirty major projects, and the removal of EU funds is also in danger, warning Karel Hanzelka, door - word of the Ministry of Transport.
ƒåSSD proposed to solve the fiscal deficit very cleverly - it will draw on the dividends of ƒåEZ (supplier and distributor of electrical energy), the state has largely fund and fuel the transport.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain, and that it is in any case a bottomless pit.
Last year it was 18 billion that were sailed from the ƒåEZ into the budget.
Each year, the dividends are used to pay the removal of environmental damage, to supplement retirement accounts or used - they reserve for the pension reform is being prepared.
Moreover, this trick increases the real budget deficit amounting to 5.7 percent of GDP according to EU rules.
And it is far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensation to victims of communism and crime, and even housing savings, decreased by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the state can act without money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay anyway, says Janota.
The Minister will then save the department side, or at worst, touch the budgetary reserve of the government.
It also lacks a hundred million to the State fund project worth two billion, which should allow to track online what expenses each administration.
The first phase will start in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find money elsewhere, the project should be stopped and sanctions would be held warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will master both operating systems.
In the future, Americans are considering a cell phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
Projects that were revealed appear promising.
Just a button and you move from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the objective of the VMware American company, which is mainly the development of computers for virtualization software.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can switch between them, you can differentiate them personally and professionally.
The two work together, said Srinivas Krishnamurti VMware society in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was introduced in November of last year and he was made a first demonstration there a few days.
It will hit the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones in no way is a fiction.
VMware has successfully presented a test version to reporters, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a Nokia N800 modified with a RAM of 128 MB, which simultaneously executing Windows Mobile and Android systems mentioned.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware company is now working with European and US operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to the devices in 2012.
Mountain snow shortage bothering hoteliers.
The deserted tracks are not a problem as back operators - slopes.
The lack of snow deters people book their skiing holidays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of hits on our website.
Customers travel offers, asking prices but dare not commit to book yet.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas, "said Martin Jandura, exploiting information portal Spindl.Info ..
If one wants to spend New Year's dreams Spindleruv Mlyn, it is better not hesitate to book too.
If we give priority to savings and the quality of accommodation only comes later, then we can try to wait a few days.
Hoteliers ≈†pindler only offer for the moment that stays for a week over New Year.
I think they will try again to place a time, but they will give them too and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will decline rapidly, "said Jandura.
The Ingtours travel agency also offers the Vrchlab√≠ still free beds for all winter periods.
Christmas week interests us most at the moment, it is not completely sold.
There is still free, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared some Christmas holidays last minute cheaper, "said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlab√≠ tourism agency may also offer the New Year in Krkono≈°e, but there is less space available.
The first fourteen days of February leaving as well, the remaining winter stays sell moderately.
This year, the interest for winter stays was negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkono≈°e.
People expect it starts to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks overlap during the week, as Christmas is complete, "think Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupation of the hotel Horizont Pec pod Snƒõ≈ækou is slightly higher than last year.
Was an improvement of approximately five percent.
We have a few last places for New Year as Christmas.
There is a great interest during the holidays from January and February of Polish sells well too, "informs Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
Omnia hotel near the central parking J√°nsk√© L√°znƒõ is complete in four to twenty percent during the New Year period.
In contrast, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the newest hotel J√°nsk√© Lazne.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already sixty percent occupancy at present.
February is somewhat lower for now but as soon as the snow will fall, interest stays in Krkono≈°e certainly grow even said the hotel manager Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
Hoteliers Krkono≈°e however should not expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be cooler and if there is rainfall, they should be snow in the mountains.
But later, the weather should warm, informs Ji≈ô√≠ Jakubsk√Ω of Hradec station the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
States - States: Repetition is the mother of wisdom.
He became even comic, of diligence with which Barack Obama, President of the reputation wise, reproduced the strategy of his predecessor on Afghanistan, he considered it - even as simple.
When he finally let his doctrine sweat so eagerly expected, it turned out that he had copied the carbon paper from the Bush Iraqi scenario there three years.
Not content to use in the text several times the phrase "as in Iraq," he did not hesitate, moreover, to use the title of Bush's speech in January 2007 as the title of his own speech " A new road ahead. "
At the same time, he personally criticized the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãBush to send reinforcements in Iraq consumed by civil war as "irresponsible and catastrophic decision in its consequences."
The following month, however, showed that the strategy of Bush, who stemmed from recommendations campaigns commanders, was the only possible and likely success to the point that the newspapers today do not speak at all of Iraq.
This did not improve the reputation of Bush, having said that, objectively speaking, he left his successor a much more favorable final situation we could hope.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again.
These are again the commanders of campaigns that have requested an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, which even severely criticized the reluctance of the White House despite the subordination habits.
He was asking 40,000 men in order to make it more favorable situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but for lack of a better option, at least it has defrauded the general 10 000 soldiers.
He managed to extricate the promise of additional 5 000 from Europe, even if there were 10 000 initially.
Which causes the most problems throughout the Obama strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw from Afghanistan armed within 18 months and complete the whole process in three years. The whole doctrine of Obama brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that an increase in half will bring the same fruit that progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The Afghan situation is distinguished by the exact opposite - you can not count on anyone, and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to leading change from day to day depending on what suits them.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will not remain as a smokescreen behind which proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is singularly complex to balance the interests of various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity on the reports, which are further complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the founding of a "prompt state action," which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem very real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy is perplexing because of its voluntarism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has worsened and is now on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and out of reality can be persuaded that the little soldiers sent into the tumult of war for their "speedy return home" will bring a true miracle.
From a political point of view, set a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible because the Taliban will view it as indirect admission of US defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the will of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative.
European politicians do not know how do not want to explain to their constituents why security in Germany or Italy is bound to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is changing events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and that enhanced sanctions have no effect on Iran, the US will find themselves facing the very difficult question of a resolution of the problem through the use of military force.
It will respond example when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Each solution of this type, however, lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Obama is that he is still three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for it to working on a new strategy in the event that - it would prove to be a total fiasco .

Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited to the Castle.
President V√°clav Klaus will receive Friday morning Finance Minister Eduard Janota, which weights stay in government because of its disagreement with the state budget for next year as it was passed by the Chamber of Deputies.
The estimated budget and can - be as the position of the firm Janota will be on the agenda of their appointment - you Friday.
Klaus also criticized the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too high, further widening the Financial crisis.
This is the door - Presidential speech Radim Ochvat who informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget that will be submitted for signature Klaus is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
However, the Chamber of Deputies approved Wednesday the proposals of the left regarding money transfers and increased the remuneration of officials of the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government accused the Social Democratic proposals that they would indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left one hand, the government, Klaus and right on the other, agree that challenges the future of Fischer firm that had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the CSSD and the Green Party.
Critics say the budget as it was voted by the deputies, removes the package saving measures passed by the government of Fischer and must contain him as indebtedness of the state.
Klaus, who may ratify the law on the state budget but nothing obliges, said today at a breakfast - lunch discussions with entrepreneurs, that policies have long neglected the "serious problem "from the" unstoppable disability "of public finances.
Now there is, according to him, no favorable solution.
Only a strong government could make an improvement, if it could be based on a consensus of the larger political parties, according to the president.
The president of the ODS Topol√°nek said the budget is staggering and that the government should question its further existence.
Vice - President of the ODS Petr Necas told ƒåTK that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan administrative practice supported by the CSSD, the ODS and the Greens clearly working.
In its response, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as "drastic verdicts."
The leader of ƒåSSD Paroubek reacted to Topol√°nek, saying that the budget deficit for this year prepared by the former government of Topol√°nek is staggering and it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
Wednesday already ƒåSSD called successful ratification of the state budget for the next year.
The Popular Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in the new Clint Eastwood movie.
Despite criticism that the lead roles are played by American actors, the South - African state that the new Hollywood film Invictus - Undefeated expose to the world a lot about the country, struggles and victories.
The story is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, Oscar-winning American actor, embodies the film on the life of Nelson Mandela, tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa's first black president.
Freeman said, it's a old Mandela ninety-one years who asked him to embody in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I told him: "If I have to incarnate, I should be able to see you personally ...
The actor who is seventy - two years that was awarded a prize for his role in the Milion Dollar Baby Clint Eastwood's drama set in the world of boxing, for example, played the leader of a movement against 'slavery became him - even slave, a fictional US president and even God in Evan movie All - Powerful but never someone still alive and as important to so many people that is Mandela.
Ex - Man southern state - African was jailed 27 years for his hard work for the end of apartheid in South Africa.
It was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning undefeated and is the title of an English author William Ernest Henley's poem published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the South rugby team captain - African Francois to unify the country. Newly elected President Mandela knows his nation remains racially divided again and again and economically after apartheid.
He is convinced to be able to unite his people through sport and decided to join the rugby players who are among the outsiders in world rankings.
The South team - African eventually progress in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela's story on the big screen.
I had no other purpose except this role so as to bring the best of reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge for me was of course talking like him.
The actor said that if he and international politicians were in the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to dine with him, to be backstage before his speech.
Most important to him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I get your energy, it transmits and I felt how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon stars in the film Francois Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh environment of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I rang the doorbell of the house, he opened and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was: 'I am much taller in the film. "
Despite the differences between the actors and real models, Invictus under the leadership of the director Eastwood has received positive reviews and there is even talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
The film critic Todd McCarthy of Variety Daily newspaper summarized his appreciation saying, "It's a great story, a very well done film."

The mystery of the will in Norway is resolved: Russian were testing a rocket.
There has been a strange light phenomenon of unknown origin - over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence has acknowledged yesterday having tested a ballistic intercontinental rocket near the Norwegian border.
However, the launch has been a failure and the type of missile "Bulava", which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army is gradually becoming a nightmare for Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His presence at the repeated rocket testing has not had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the time, or did not Bulava flight, or it is damaged in flight ..
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" like "missile that does not fly."
A missile that does not fly but shines.
This 13th test took place at the start normally.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was further damage to the equipment.
This is clearly the engine of the third stage of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew sub - nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij that sailed under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired just a boat in motion and submerged.
That is why the mysterious light - over Norway caused by a flying object unidentifiablepublic has likely been a "Bulava" defective.
Moreover, the Norwegian did not doubt for a moment that this is a Russian rocket.
The general argue that this time - this, one can not speak of absolute failure.
The first two stages of the rocket resisted and damage affected only the third.
In previous cases, the engines have experienced failures in the first stage.
Although none of the test launches has happened smoothly, the leadership of the Ministry of Defence believes that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of nearly fifty percent thus fills the general optimism and they always say that one day "Bulava" will fly smoothly and she even carry ten nuclear cores hypersonic weighing a total of 1.15 tons .
The legendary Fetisov has signed a 51 year contract with CSKA Moscow.
The legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will come again in a professional match at age 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup will lend a hand - his strong CSKA Moscow team in need and will enter probablementd√©j√† in Friday's game against Petrograd.
Fetisov, who ended his career at forty in 1998, is now the president of CSKA.
After the injury Denis Kuliash we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov trains regularly and is willing to help the team.
We still have to adjust some details on the form, says the coach of the club Sergey Nyemtchinov quoted by AP.
It was not clear whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will concern only one match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetisov becomes Russian professional hockey player older.
In NHL, the legendary striker Gordie Howe played a season for Hartford and got 15 goals and 26 assists.

Hyundai listened unions and cancels any overtime.
The management of the No≈°ovice Hyundai factory has agreed with unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the extra frequent hours that unions have declared a state of emergency Monday strike.
The door - Petr Vanƒõk word of the Hyundai plant confirmed.
However, management wants to put even agreed with the unions worked on a Saturday this year.
We can not give up our production plan, it is essential, that's why additional voluntary hours have been proposed Saturday, December 19 knowing that there would be two teams, said Vanƒõk.
The Sedmiƒçka.cz website reported that the company has offered a bonus 400 CZK to employees who would be part of Saturday's team.
It will also be assigned a posteriori day worked for 28 November.
The company, according to Vanƒõk, decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for extra hours, or they can be a substitute day off on December 28 and extend their end of year celebrations aindiqu√© Vanƒõk.
On top of that all employees present on Saturday will be compensated for the costs of transport and for their lunch.
Given that overtime was the most pressing issue and warmest in the comments and union demands as employees who have spontaneously ceased production last week, management has made the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, said Vanƒõk.
Until last week, the employees of the car factory were forced to work two additional hours almost daily in addition to eight hours.
The unions have canceled the strike state after signing the agreement.
The following negotiations between the direction of the car factory and trade unions to take place Friday after - noon.
The union leader Petr Kucha≈ô said Wednesday they were ready to stop strike alert if agreed on their demands and signed a joint document.
The situation at the plant peaked last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees went on strike spontaneously due to incessant overtime.
They also protested against the poor conditions of pay and alleged hazing.
Management has defended the fact that the employees had to work extra to fill in car production imperatives.
At the announcement of the strike Monday, unions have also requested that employees who have ceased production are not subject to any sanction.
The unions are asking the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want retribution 5000 crowns (209 ‚Ç¨) for women - one.
The car factory Hyundai No≈°ovice now employs 2000 people.
It started mass production last year in November.
It has manufactured about 80,000 vehicles up to September this year, having a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on HIV "steadfast" too.
A team of Czech and German scientists test new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved material is that it acts also on the viruses that have already developed immunity to the drug.
The reality is, in some cases, above the fact that the combination is not as intensely on common variants of the virus as well as some existing drugs.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at present.
Nevertheless, one can dramatically extend the lives of patients through a combination of drugs that prevent the multiplication of HIV in the body.
However, their consumption leads to a series of side effects.
In addition, the repression of this multiplication effect the development of so-called resistant viruses on which drugs have no effect.
The work of experts from the three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague V≈†CHT Heidelberg University opens up a way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes act on the head of the multiplication of the HIV virus protein.
The metalocarboranes are boron assembly, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of researchers led them to discover new substances "improved" on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their connections to the virus proteins.
The metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two cages multiple walls are formed by the boron atoms, and hydrogen atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A traitor and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus which is essential for the virus life cycle.
Without the division of HIV caused by HIV protease there would not rise to mature infectious virus particles.
If you stop the HIV protease, it will also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the researchers said in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences Czech Republic.
In their work published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of combinations in which two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic link, which is then systematically modified.
Somewhat lower but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this group of substances on the HIV protease was tested specimens and its resistant variants, obtained from patients infected with HIV.
In the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as clinical medicine, however, does not weaken on resistant versions against which current medications are often ineffective.
The metalocarboranes with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are interesting combinations to look more to move toward the development of drugs effective against HIV, says Pavl√≠na ≈òez√°ƒçov√°, Director of Structural Biology Laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over the budget. The ODS is attacking Fischer, who defends himself.
The president of the ODS (Civic Democratic Party), Mirek Topol√°nek described as "alarming" the budget ratified the following year, and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister described the verdict about the drastic ODS.
He says take time to analyze.
The door - word of the ODS Petr Necas said that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan administrative practice supported by the CSSD, the ODS and the Green Party are clearly working.
According to Necas, the head of government should decide whether ilprend support in the House of Deputies on the minority who cares to fight against the growing deficit, or if he cares to stay in office with the help of parliamentary left.
Neƒças warned that the positions of the ODS and Social Democrats over the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposite.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday the budget for 2010, but with the proposed changes in the amount of CZK 12 billion included the left.
The House has increased the money for salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's complaint against the proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that they indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the room before the vote, obeying the wishes of the government as an amended budget which is least bad alternative that interim budget.
Disappointment and futility.
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and feelings of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will further reflect on the current situation.
Neƒças is convinced that if Janota threatened to step down if ratified the proposed amendments, the situation might be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment - you Monday with the Prime Minister after his time in government.
He said it while he wondered would stay in office.
His disappointment with the negotiations on the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue the fight against the budget deficit, Neƒças believes that the ƒåSSD representatives who imposed changes in the budget, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other legislation increasing the deficit such as those involving health insurance, pensions, or reform of the law on services.
Topol√°nek: Ministers nominated by the ODS are not involved.
This is the case of the head of government Fischer and the entire government.
Ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing harmful, stressed Topol√°nek in a text statement from the States - States.
He recalled that the vice - ministers of some ministries claim to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Neƒças stressed that if Fischer decides to resign over the fact to wage a struggle against the amount of the fiscal deficit, "it is quite logical and proper that it is based on the majority of the left who is currently the House. ".
That said, it should not expect support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I have not thought about and once it will be the order of the day so I devote myself, said since the House to reporters, Defence Minister Martin Bart√°k elected government just by Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon - noon for a discussion of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS has backtracked at the request of the Prime Minister.
Neƒças stressed along the ODS would probably Wednesday voted against the amended budget if it had not specifically asked Democrats to allow the budget vote.
We do not have the feeling of being orphaned, it is not small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not suffered rebuke from the president of the Party for room or in the country during the budget negotiation.
I have not noticed that my vote would have been lacking.
I already knew when I gave up my mandate what would follow in the coming months would be a Bolshevisation House and destruction of all that was positive, Topol√°nek responded in person.
According to the new schedule of ƒåD there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
Czech Railways will suppress or limit from December 13, some express and regional trains less loaded and strengthen the contrary others.
The total coverage of transport will drop the day of entry into force of the new schedules of two percent from today.
Most tariffs will not change, including base rates and reduced rates.
Examples are the inhabitants of the Ostrava region, which will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a Pendolino train.
Instead, express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be less fast trains on the line Prague - P√≠sek - ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice, the hotline Prague - Letohrad will be radically reduced.
Regionally, the greatest reduction in transport concerns the Hradec Kr√°lov√© region eight percent in total, however Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the line Prague - T√°bor - ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice are also canceled and the circulation of some express trains on the line Prague - P√≠sek - ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the biggest changes can be seen the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice in Prague for now residents must change Milovice Lys√° nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of Esko suburban system, the opening is possible due to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lys√° nad Labem and Milovice.
Remote lines to the capital will have their final destination at the main train station in Prague (Praha Hlavn√≠ n√°dra≈æ√≠).
The ƒåD introduce more lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to ≈†umperk / Jesen√≠k leave in intervals of two hours.
Travellers can not take the Pendolino to Bratislava from December 13.
The bill this year for regional railways 200 million additional crowns.
Express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport and Railways pay the next year a total of four billion crowns to adjust the visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are controlled by the regions who will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the State will contribute up to almost three million.
This year regional trains are more expensive 200 million.
Railways have recently signed a contract for ten years, until now the time was still a year.
Railways assess the system, which also explains that they have not resorted to a price increase for the vast majority of tickets.
The changes affect only the notes of a day ƒåD Net and Internet tickets Eliska reduced price.
For travelers without discount card, the price of ƒåD Net increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of newly Eliska will depend on the distance covered, whereas previously it was valid between cities of a region in the selection and was at a single price of 160 crowns.

The history of South Africa is everybody's business, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela.
The new Hollywood film Clint Eastwood arrives in US theaters in the coming days, the title is Invictus (Czech official title is Invictus: Nepora≈æen√Ω) and narrae part of the life of former President of South - Africa Nelson Mandela.
The role of world famous fighter against apartheid returned to Morgan Freeman, who was selected there for years by Mandela himself - even to embody.
The Actor of the legendary South African rugby champion was awarded to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theaters, the feedback from critics and the public are heard.
Nelson Mandela.
Its full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born June 18, 1918 at Mvezu in South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for freedom of mind, then in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize together with de Klerk.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great expectations since it is presented at a time when one hand is South Africa where preparations for the World Cup soccer, and secondly because the media are agitated by of disturbing news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination on the part of the inhabitants of the black majority in power.
According to AP, the reactions to the new film are quite positive for the moment in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations towards the main roles where "strut" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is, however, repeating his words, proud of the film.
I dreamed of this role for many years and I am well prepared.
I also repeatedly met Nelson Mandela personally for power - as they say - recover his energy, he said in the first official film in Los Angeles.
I think this is a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember the film via the personality and message of Mandela.
This is the story of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual he added.
Wear the jersey of the national rugby team.
The film based on the story of the British writer John Carlin novel's title is translated freely. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the piece that gave his creation to the people portrayed South African defender of human rights during his term as president.
Morgan Freeman in the film so try to pick two racial groups in a long divided people and as Nelson Mandela in 1995 he entered wearing the jersey of the South African national team on the pitch at the World Cup, Africa South had won then.
For having shown bikini lawn, which is regarded in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been standing ovation he was fourteen mostly white audience and was recognized by the white population.
Hopefully the football championship will manage to unite people again into one nation, said the rugby player Chester Williams, who was in 1995 the only "black" of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the South African tense situation will improve.
The white South - Africans are skeptical, however, as was recently told in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, rugby fan who fled to Great - Britain.
The championship begins June 11, 2010.

A fire engulfed the morning a transformer CEPS company's distribution center near the town of V√Ω≈°kov na Lounsku.
According Luk√°≈° Marvan door - word of the fire √öst√≠, there are six units operating on the fire.
They counted originally let the transformer burn, but they have revised their opinion and extinguish the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical fault, short - circuit the transformer.
No one was injured and on the door - Pavla company's word Mandatova the incident did not endanger the safe operation of the transmission assembly.
The damage is estimated at tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure will be known after fire is out.
According Mandatova, destroyed the transformer must be replaced with a new one.
It adds that in ten years of activity, the CEPS company has experienced anything similar and that such incidents are isolated.
Supplies of electricity were not interrupted, said the door - word of ƒåEZ company for the Northern Bohemia So≈àa Holingerova Hendrychov√°, operation of homes, government and industry was not affected by the fire the processing station.
As CEPS is the exclusive operator in the Czech Republic sets of transmission and power lines 400 kV and 220 kV.

Janƒçura will file a complaint for defamation against three prefects of the CSSD.
Radim Janƒçura, owner of Student Agency, today will file defamation suit against three Democratic social prefects.
Michal Ha≈°ek and concretely against the South Moravian region against Radko Mart√≠nka of the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesa≈ô√≠k.
Janƒçura dans l'a indiqu√© Twenty minutes de Radio≈æurn√°l.
The complaint is related to the attempt of the company to operate regional railways in some areas.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three have attacked us and say that we do foodies, so we only made an offer for what they wanted them - selves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the price of Czech Railways which were signed last week.
So it remains for us to defend ourselves.
This is in exchange aspersions on the company Student Agency, said in Janƒçura Radiozurnal.
Similarly, it said it had evidence that no region has not made in accordance with European law.
We prepare for this complaint for the European Commission.
Ha≈°ek considers the filing of a complaint by Mr. Janƒçura is following his media spectacle that serves as free advertising for his company and himself.
I am of course willing to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on others to do the same prefects.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make clear that it is precisely Mr. Janƒçura manipulating public opinion and uses false and misleading arguments about regional rail transport, said Ha≈°ek.
Janƒçura has already informed last week that it will invest several million crowns in an ad that mention the adverse actions of the regions.
He told Radiozurnal that interrupt the campaign after Christmas and he intends to resume after the New Year.
He said the campaign will target corruption at large.
Janƒçura began his campaign after the regions have agreed to entrust the Czech Railways operate rail connections for an order of 150 billion crowns, without issuing a tender.
According Janƒçura, such a course of action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even led to Janƒçura threats from a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was that if we did not stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the ƒåSSD, I do not know who it is but I will not say his name, said today Janƒçura Radiozurnal.

The voices are already saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumococcal peak.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines the maximum prices for vaccines that will pay health insurance.
Specialists also see through the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated against pneumococcal free.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If we started vaccination last year or earlier, you will have to pay self - the following vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and the 5th month of the child.
Already last year a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated children against pneumococcus.
Yet parents paid 1600 crowns or more for a dose.
The younger immunization requires four doses.
Experts estimate that each year health insurers spend 300 to 450 000 kroons in doses.
However, they save on medical care than unvaccinated children require.
So far the state was spending about 500,000 crowns a year for every child immunization.
The refunded vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococci are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammation of the meninges and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, there has so far 28 deaths of children under age 10 caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced vaccination refunded.
Vaccination will be compulsory?
There are opinions regarding a potential vaccine in the future.
As of January, it must be set by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the Association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovsk√Ω indicated that vaccination would be more positive.
His association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococcus.
At an international conference in which our association participated, specialists were not really pleased that we have an optional vaccination.
This is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased to have been able to impose at least this.
I think this is a direction that we must now follow Kalovsk√Ω said.
But the Ministry of Health does not change the process of vaccination against pneumococcus.
We absolutely no plans for now, said his door - Vlastimil Sr≈°e≈à word.
The optional vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors.
Hana Cabrnochov√°, President of the Company specialized pediatricians, recognizes that vaccination based volontariata its flaws.
If all children were vaccinated, one could envisage a decline vaccinations renewals "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making voluntary vaccination" but said Cabrnochov√°.
Experts predict that by next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccinate their infants.
Vaccination against pneumococcal marks a break also because this is the first vaccination of children is funded by insurance companies, not the state.
Cabrnochov√° explains that insurance should release funds for prevention, they would save and on possible future medical care.
Physicians should buy their products them - selves.
However, this is related to the concerns of practitioners pediatricians, concerning the purchase of vaccines.
The original intent was to purchase vaccines through insurance, doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products supplied by the state.
Some MPs, however, feared that this would allow insurance "deduct amounts of health insurance."
Thus, physicians will need to buy the products and wait for the insurance reimburse them.
According to estimates, pediatricians must individually invest nearly 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is a significant amount.
It will be far from easy, as Cabrnochov√°.
The son of an American artist involved in a "museum of flight."
The son of Frank Frazetta, known illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $ 20 million (¬£ 12 million) in the museum of his father.
In Pennsylvania, the police said that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested while loading 90 paintings in his vehicle and a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a backhoe to break into the museum, in the region of the Pocono Mountains.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81 years old, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the news agency Associated Press (AP).
AP quoted a police official that young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family feud.
According to a police statement said Mr. Frazetta Jr., 52, claims he was authorized by his father to "enter the museum by any means, to transport the paintings in a storage facility," reported the agency.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denies giving such authorization, the agency said.
The Labour defends the increase in the budget tax.
The ministers defended the tax increases and spending cuts announced in the report pre - Budget, despite the criticism of the opposition, business and trade unions.
The Tories said that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about deficit reduction by postponing decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor has also come under fire by addressing low wages and average wages.
Among its major proposals, one can see a 0.5% increase in the Social Insurance and a ceiling of 1% on public wages in 2011.
The wrath of Social Insurance.
The unions protested that low wages are penalized by a recession which they are not responsible and warned that "problems" lay ahead.
The decrease in socially insurance that will provide approximately GBP 3 billion per year - has put the business angry, because according to him, it is a tax on jobs when the goal should be a economic recovery.
The increase reserved for those who earn over 20,000 GBP a year, affect about 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF PRE REPORT - BUDGET.
Social insurance will increase by 0.5% from April 2011.
The economy encoreplus drop the 4.75% expected this year.
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses.
The increase in the tax on company profits for small businesses has been abandoned.
Tax rebates for electric cars and wind turbines.
Pension increase of 2.5%.
According to estimates of the Treasury, a person will lose win 30,000 GBP 90 GBP per year and one winner will lose 40,000 GBP 190 GBP, while a person earning 10,000 GBP 110 GBP per year will earn more.
Ministers said that their goal to halve the deficit before 2013 ENTAILED "difficult decisions" but stressed the fact that 60% of the burden of additional taxes weigh on the top 5% of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Treasury Secretary, denied a tax increase and stressed that a decrease in spending was a "drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important. They allow us to halve the deficit, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he was confident and that economic growth would restart at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecast of economic growth - which will influence the amount he will have to borrow and the speed at which the deficit will be covered - have been questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise its preliminary figures.
In his address, he said the economy probably fall by 4.75% this year - far worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - so that the loan would be 3 billion GDP higher than the preliminary estimate.
"Missed opportunity." '
The Conservatives that will launch on Thursday a new advertising campaign warning against the "debt crisis" of Labour, said that the project to borrow 789 billion GBP over the next six years was unsustainable.
Ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how to pay have - they said, eluding "cynically" hard choices until after the elections - to be held in June 2010.
"They have not presented significant about what they would do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Shadow Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do so and they missed."
"The important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte.
The Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the Tory proposals that would result in more rapid and significant reduction in the deficit.
But Lib Dems said that the money raised through higher taxes and lower spending would be used to support spending next year and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were "built on the wind. "
Nick Robinson, political editor of the BBC, said the timing of the announcements - such as the increase in inflation for certain disability benefits in April, mentioned - bedspread leave the face Chancellor for propaganda charges being money just recovered the following year.
However, leLabour insists that additional support is provided so that people in most need and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Faux budget".
Although the ministers have not released details of spending - beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that the restrictions of public spending would only start to be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institute of Fiscal Studies) said that the figures of the Chancellor involve in the future, substantial reductions in many areas, potentially including transportation, higher education, science and defense .
"The pain is in fact only postponed," said its director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner," said Roger Bootle, economic adviser to accountants Deloitte.
"This was a false report pre -. The markets in budget well aware."
The FBI investigation into the "Americans arrested in Pakistan."
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American reporters suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested in a raid in a house in Sargodha in the eastern province of Punjab, said the US embassy in Pakistan, told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether they were the same men who had been reported missing from their home in the US state of Virginia last month.
The US Department of Foreign Affairs said he was also looking for information on these people.
Three of them are presented as being of Pakistani descent, an Egyptian heritage and one of Yemeni origin.
If they are US citizens, of course, we would like to know the charges against them and under what conditions they are being held, "said leporte - speech, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit door - FBI spokesman said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with Pakistan authorities to determine their identity and nature of their business there - there, and if they are truly students who are missing," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house owned by the uncle of one of them.
That - has said the house was already monitored by local police and no charges had been laid against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, reported the Reuters news agency, but she said the United - States should "work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people. "
The five students were missing from their home by their families in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns the "abuse" Iranians.
The last twenty years, human rights have been less respected than ever, according to the report of Amnesty International.
The report presents "violations of repetitions" by the regime before and after the presidential election campaign in June.
A man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous reviews regarding its non-compliance with human rights.
The authorities said that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public protests since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison terms and prosecutors say at least five people were sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, the BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has recognized some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of Kahrizak detention center .
But since then, the authorities have tolerated no criticism, says our correspondent.
"False Confession."
Amnesty International has reported the case of a computer science student, 26, Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of 'Working with networks of Facebook "and protesting against the election results.
"They often struck me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under the eyes, neck, head ... They threatened to execute me and they humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession, and he was released and left in the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the losing candidate in the elections, Mehdi Karroubi, said the protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison, and others have been violated.
The Iranian authorities have denied the rape charges, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he was locked in a container with 75 others for more than eight weeks in a detention center at Kahrizak.
Amnesty accepted that the Iranian Parliament and judiciary create a committee to investigate the post disorders - elections and the government's response, but she said the mandate and powers of these bodies were not clear and that results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested over the past three weeks, in order to prevent other events.
Ski slopes built in the city park.
Over 100 tons of artificial snow was used to transform the site into a Bristol track competitions.
The √©v√©nementPiste in the Park (A track in the park) has attracted skiers and snowboarders 16 semi - professional competing for cash prizes.
At the top of the track of Brandon Hill Park, a small jump preceded a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a fourth year student of Medicine, said the view from the top of the track was beautiful but that - it was quite daunting.
It is a beautiful sight, with all the twinkling lights of the city below.
Here are found some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talent, "he added.
Prizes were awarded to the best acrobatics - or figures achieved on the track.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be left to melt.
Always and them.
Islam can - be it French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte.
Some readers will be attracted to this new book, admirers of the last book of the author, "Why the French do not like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on an issue that has divided and preoccupied the country since fifteen years and whose effects are still being felt today.
The last book of Mr. Bowen has a much broader and more ambitious frame.
Good anthropologist, he does not just want to know what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes in France now provide this quem. Bozen-called "Muslim areas" for 5m - 6m Muslims.
He knows very well listen and play discussions between teachers and students on issues that concern them most.
A Muslim should - they married in a mosque or at the town hall (or both)?
The evolution and gay rights should - they be taught to young Muslims?
A Muslim woman can - she marry a non - Muslim?
A Muslim can - I use a banking system based on interest for a loan?
These are practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas of concern to the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the public, except possibly - be Tariq Ramadan, a Muslim Arab born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate to the end.
Lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa French or European Islam.
Intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts advocates of a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, which today make up a small part of European Muslims.
M Bowen believes that the values ‚Äã‚Äãof Muslims and secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can not be reached with the efforts of each camp.
He wonders how French politicians (and the intellectual elite so virulent guardian of secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
He said Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews have also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, he detects a "narrow core values."
Islam can - be it French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darker world view.
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that makes up the is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that can not survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, fishing expeditions and sailing in new open water, with diplomats, lawyers and writers now in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice," Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the far north, the polar bear.
Connoisseur of history and complicated politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who were proven hunting polar bears.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then brave aspiring 14 year old who had to fight the tip of his musket is surely a myth, but the rest is true.
Young cubs, then caught they swam alongside their mother, just killed were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
In the early twentieth century, a famous show brought together 75 bears simultaneously.
Even today, a zoo dimensions are still typically a millionth of the area needed an adult freedom. the climate is rarely indicated: a living polar bear in Singapore turned green due to algae growing in its thick fur.

Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat of hunters on the survival of the species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and Inuit Indians motoski use powerful fusilsd'assaut to hunt their prey.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two nations hunting the ice will stay the longest.
In his new book, "After the ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and an exciting preview of what will be - to be the future over there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can not tell the exact speed of change.
It's not for lack of trying.
Late nineteenth and early twentieth, pioneers Travel Fridtjof Nansen gave the first information on the melting of the ice cap.
Sub - sailors of the Cold War were then mapped the changes in relief - the one - one.
Satellite monitoring and sensors placed on icebergs are a great help, but most of the work is done by hardened men camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplate the extraordinary and tiny world of the system depends on the Arctic ice, formed by the brackish water streams pressed by freezing.
But the above mentioned Bears - over to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, all will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, maybe it will - be our turn."
Marines, among the 6000 people who laid wreaths on the graves at Arlington.
The first class De'Angello Robinson, 19, has traveled seven hours by bus to drop a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina Cemetery at Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, the day was devoted to salute the men and women who one day were them.
In a few months we will be sent where, we could be in their place, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If that happened, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers have gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans, in different sections of Arlington Cemetery Ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, Worcester Wreath Company owner in Harrington, Maine, has launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Cemetery Ceremony.
Now, to continue a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen, make the trip each year, stopping in various cities on their way to organize the celebrations in honor of soldiers and victims of terrorism.
Worcester also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America (Wreaths Across America), which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves of Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the cemetery Fayetteville National Cemetery enArkansas in Battery Park in New York City and the memorial site for the victims of Flight 93 in Shanksville United Airlines, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the foundation Walmart Foundation gave more than $ 150,000 to buy and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she had made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, who died of a military career.
Although her husband is not buried at Arlington, Hunt said that for her, the gesture was a way to thank those who had sacrificed.
It's a small gesture can do to support our troops civilians, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between lawns and hills stretches the cemetery.
Volunteers chose ancient tombs dating back to the First and Second World War, and the Vietnam War, because they - are not visited as often as new graves, organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, while the children played and couples held hands, wearing the crowns of fresh pine on gray graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a red bow on top.
Close, hovering silence on Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1000 crowns to decorate the section but the somber mood of the current wars filled the area.
Cried individuals without hiding, others prayed and families and friends supported in the cold air.
Some read aloud names carved in stone, while others leaned to see small cards black and white information buried in the damp earth for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears at the grave of his son.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio and led eight hours to come and visit the grave of Sergeant Marine GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget whereby we are free ... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I have gone, I want someone to remember him."
An American citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities.
The Cuban government has arrested an American national who was distributing laptops and mobile phones in the country, said the services of the US Department of Foreign Affairs.
The national, who has not been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular authorities and the US Interest Section in Havana trying to access the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, though under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested under the pretext of being "dangerous."
All activities so - called revolutionaries, including moderate and critical writings protests entail the risk of arrest.
The anti graffiti - government and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a blogging community more and more, conducted by Yoani S√°nchez, popular commentator who often writes about how she and husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
S√°nchez made several requests to leave the country to receive awards but the permissions have always been denied him.
The detention of an American citizen will be - be increasing tensions between the communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration is pursuing a "soft" approach to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government advance concrete steps such as releasing political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, so that States - States can reciprocate.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although this is of new consumer goods and desired in a country where the average salary of an officer is $ 15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texting or a 15 minute conversation that corresponds to a day's wages.
On the island, Internet use is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and foreign visitors to the country, as well as certain government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans wishing often connected should send their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few American imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, Press Officer at the US Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention is a big mistake.
An activity which, in any other public company would be allowed - to distribute free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas Program Director of Human Rights Watch, which recently published a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba," referring to Raul Castro installation as leader of the country to replace Fidel, his brother ill elder.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often stopped, put on trial and imprisoned the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction to the States - the United States, as the two countries begin to initiate a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevented a plot to send men in Afghanistan.
Saturday, the Pakistani authorities have spotted an organization supposed to prepare a plot to send five Northern Virginia men to Afghanistan to kill US troops, saying they hoped the case would dismantle an important network of terrorist recruiters that scour the Internet in search of young men radicalized.
Investigators said they were hunting a insurgente hidden personality, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after being discovered when one of them made comments approving terrorist waves on the video site YouTube on the Internet.
Arrived in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote region of Pakistan's tribal belt, al home - Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Pakistani secret services was informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had not convinced the commanders of al - Qaeda that these men were not involved in CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network .
Therefore, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far northern mountains of banned - is becoming a haven for terrorism.
They were seen as infiltrators.
That is why they were rejected, said a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The government official said the men were determined and they were still trying to obtain the necessary permits for entry into the camps of al - Qaeda when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
For these five men - who remain in Pakistan and questioned by the FBI - emphasize the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and can - be more important in determining the people who give his confidence.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US secret services have been a priority to infiltrate men in the al - Qaida network.
The organization's recruiters act as guards - barriers denying entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who can prove to be spies.
According to analysts, potential American recruits are studied closely by al - Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to US targets and their propagandaire value.
Evan Kohlmann, however, expert NEFA Foundation based in the United - States, said that terrorist groups must also increasing attention in recent years in the choice of people because they accept the US secret services have become experts regarding their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow his recruitment model that so many other people have already taken? Kohlmann said.
The model is one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen call for "action" for the climate.
Tens of thousands of Protestants marched through the streets here Saturday, demanding greater climate action on the part of the negotiators working in the palace of the Bella Convention Center in the city.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100 000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists have turned some explosives near a set of government buildings in the city center.
On this day when little happened during the climate talks sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists marched from the city, displaying signs in English saying "There is no planet B "and in Spanish, saying" The Earth says she's had enough. "
Many celebrities have joined the protests, including the Danish top model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travel to the birthplace of his mother, Peru, opened his eyes to the harrowing problems faced by the countries due to the impact of climate change that are already happening. "
This is one of the reasons why I decided to join the great march - to spread the word and appeal to world leaders for them to take the right decisions, ambitious and committed it said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be business, it is not possible to avoid it.
Police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said it had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they wore masks or were in possession of pocket knives.
Police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said it had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they wore masks or were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in the climate talks, activists wearing masks and black clothes, lit several explosives near the main Copenhagen canal is surrounded by some ministries .
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that those - these first rockets were then followed by "a few big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to follow the course, throughout the post - noon.
But it seems that the protesters have failed to awaken the conscience of the key authorities such as Su Wei, China's representative to the climate.
When asked if he thought that an event would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he said in English "In fact, it's something I was not aware.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying "The event is important, I can not hear what is happening outside."
He observed that walking might seem useful or harmful depending on the perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or they harm the freedom of others."
The test results reveal stubborn racial gaps.
The federal report last week on mathematics achievement has brought good news for the public schools in Washington DC.
Although the District is still far behind the top facilities, the report shows that the Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1 - cm2) are far greater progress during the previous two years in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of Progress in Education) is the persistent gap between the results of African - American and white, in terms of both local and national.
The average scores for white children of Grade 4 (cm1) to WashingtonD.C. have increased over the past two years, from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their classmates African - American rose only three points of 209-212.
The achievement gap has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
Progress of African - Americans in grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling only one point of 245-244.
The average score for white was not included in the test results because the sample was not large enough.
Overview over six years is not more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in class Grade 4 (cm1) when the first report was published NAEP District, was 60 points (262-202).
Although the results obtained by the children in both groups rose during this period, the difference is only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District expressed concern that rising celebrated by the Director of group of educational institutions Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were propelled by white students who were already good items.
This would mean that we have raised the aggregate considering the elements at the top of the ladder, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, director of DC Voice, a nonprofit group that promotes equality in Education of the District.
I do not jump for joy for one or two points earned, said Kwame R. Brown (related Democrat), Member of the DC Council and whose daughter is in Grade 4 at Eaton Elementary (Elementary School).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said that the message of the test results is that the middle schools (colleges) of the city in desperate need of attention.
Really, you always want to see positive signs and I respect him.
But what's scary is that we do not spend enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said the district should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, Wilson Reading System, targeting schoolchildren end of classes of elementary school and early college who have not integrated the basics of reading more early in their school careers and are quite late compared to their peers.
Each day, the mathematics curriculum for Kindergarten classes (kindergarten) to Grade 6 (6th) focuses on games and experiences of real life, as they have been implemented in the District by the former head Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of NAEP reported last week.
I just think we need to keep working to provide better services to those students below the level of the class, said Rhee.
Others believe that the results of the NAEP raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall performance of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less well to reduce the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a trainer from teaching at the University of California, Berkeley who studies the results of tests of the cities.
Conventional political solution is to dedicate your resources and management reform schools located in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Also this targeting can have political repercussions that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like other schools superintendent, she tries to use the middle class whites and blacks.
We focus for the development of a system of good schools.
We must strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of the place from which they originate, be assured that their children will get an excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that one of the key factors in reducing the achievement gap was the length of the traditional public school, 180 days today in the District Washington, to be in competition with Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to get the strength to change, said Janey, who has come to an agreement with the union of its teachers last year for 185 days, which he considers a "starting point" for still get an increase in the next contract.
Make higher education a promise for the future.
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, gets out and blinked a moment at the sight of white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela's parents had only been able to finish high school at El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela her - well, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Also, as she and other students from grade 8 (4th) of the group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $ 38,690 a year, his attitude was less that of a new student impressed enthusiastic.
Super's where I'm going to study! exclaimed Graciela wishing to study medicine, while the guide directed them to the entrance of the science building.
Yippee, really? says - she thoughtfully when told him the low ratio law professor - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that visited the children during their journey of discovery of three days and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not whether you're going to college.
The question is where.
Although this question still arises largely to the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who have left the school where have become teenage parents, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from the university that allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a Hispanic of the" second generation "of cinqpoursuit his studies in high school - a significant achievement considering that so many of their immigrant parents, most from Mexico or Central America, came to the States - States without finishing high school.
Their success is important, say the researchers, they open the way to future generations who will play an important role in the workforce of the country.
Researchers studying the doors say they - these have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their unfamiliarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to come to the university - especially if efforts are regular and long term.
When you look at the children of low income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention at any time will not help said Patricia G√°ndara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin students - American.
We have to think to offer a support network to those children from kindergarten through high school.
The federal program that funded the visit universities Graciela is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (are preparing you), it provides more than $ 300 million annually to local school systems to organize the university preparation programs that begin when low income families are middle students school (college) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program was attended by over 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the US Department of Education.
The Ministry of Iraqi oil obtained agreements with 10 foreign oil companies.
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its ailing infrastructure during two auctions that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Ministry of Iraqi oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies of China, Russia and Europe are poised to play a major role in the rehabilitation of the oil industry in Iraq , struck down by decades of war and sanctions.
US companies left with a stake in only two of 10 fields auctioned.
Seven US companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began Friday.
The one who had put a bid lost.
Two US companies were awarded contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of US companies have Asian and European companies that are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, Iraq Oil Forum Forum editor, site of information on the Internet.
It will take time before another offer is made in Iraq.
The security concerns, supported by massive coordinated bombings Tuesday and political instability as US troops withdraw military held back US oil companies, preventing them from entering with more force in Iraq has the third largest reserves of crude oil in the world, analysts say.
US companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, especially Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government whose labor costs were significantly lower work and were more willing to take risks because they do not have to report to the shareholders.
Exxon - Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only US companies to win contracts with the Department.
The largest US companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong links with the Ministry of Iraqi oil and brought him technical advice, are divided empty.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this week - end.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, has over bid on contracts with other companies and is left with substantial interests in contracts for two major fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy and a technological power, said Assam Jihad - holder of the Ministry of Petroleum word.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and achieve its commitments in Iraq.
Pre companies - selected to submit bids made offers which were then compared to the price per barrel that the Department agreed to pay to motivate production - above current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al - Qaeda was killed in Pakistan.
It seems that a US missile that hit along the border with Afghanistan has killed one of the organizers of the operations of al - Qaida, this week, said Friday the US authorities against the - espionage.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against a terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al - Somali was one of two Arab men suspected to have been killed by a pair of missiles in their car on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to US sources Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities said that the missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA inside the anarchic tribal border of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading toward the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of Pakistan's civilian intelligence service, speaking on phone Miran Shah.
Representatives of the authority declared that the suspects local activists rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of the "totally shredded body."
It was completely impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two representatives anti - American terrorists gave unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of the responsible military organizers of al - Qaida terrorists who directed operations of the group outside the region Afghanistan - Pakistan.
Its role was to organize conspiracies around the world, said one of the authorities who requested anonymity, citing the sensitivity of air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included plotting attacks against the United - States and Europe.
He followed the strategic guidelines of the leaders of al - Qaeda and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the US authority said Somali had grown rapidly in the ranks of al - Qaida's and had a very good relationship with other extremist groups in the region.
It may - be not known to the American public, but that does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, said the second official.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second major character of al - Qaeda or Taliban leader-killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, and three other operators.
The pace of attacks carried out by CIA drones has declined since the summer, about six months to two operations, according to figures provided by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may - be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, says the site.
The UN special envoy in Kabul withdraws.
The special envoy of the UN in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would resign in March at the end of a tumultuous term marred by widespread corruption allegations in the presidential elections supported by the UN.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the increase but expressed concern about the timing of the States - United for a troop withdrawal that would begin in 18 months and would require other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, sending the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United - States and other military powers to increase the number of international staff supporting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase should be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he did not resign but simply respect the commitment he made to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki - moon knows now that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better start looking for my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to representatives of the UN, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
The officials say the name of Staffan di Mistura has been cited; he is a citizen Italo - Switzerland who recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean - Marie Gu√©henno, a French who previously led peacekeeping operations of the UN peace.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September to encourage President Hamid Karzai in the presidential elections and to hide the evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the allegations but said that the charges Galbraith - who was fired - "have damaged the mission because it was already a healthy dose of skepticism regarding the International Election Observation" .
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate relief of US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN officials that they allow his successor to hire more staff from the United - States and other Western countries than it is assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration regarding the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that heavy UN hiring regulations hindered its ability to bring new talent.
UN rules are such that I could not recruit a single person since May, he said.
It is catastrophic and it can not last.
Gates: Iran must receive additional penalties.
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking before an audience of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a one-week visit in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, has played down the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in answer to the question of a soldier on the possibility of such an outcome. ¬®.
One of the things that weighs me most is that if I've learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictability inherent in war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates noted that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians in the street.
He said a "set of incentives and punishments" may be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would actually be in worse security with nuclear weapons "because" his people suffer greatly 'of these sanctions.
Friday in a statement by the door - White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear expertise only for peaceful purposes.
In the Geneva talks on October 1, he said it would resume dialogue on reducing its nuclear program and agreed to give up a significant portion of its enriched uranium storage, fuel exchange for desperately needed medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed such an agreement, a way of building confidence on both sides and to buy time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have receded attempts to agree - in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on the fact of whether to engage with the United - States.
Frankly, I think the stiffening Iran with some of the proposals of the international community for which they had given their agreement in early October, pushed the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to will join what they had not considered in terms of significant additional sanctions cons Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals before it turns to other options, including pursuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has a Once called "increased sanctions."
In a statement Thursday in New York, the Mission of Iran to the United Nations denounced what it calls "baseless allegations" of some members of the Security Council on the nuclear activities of Iran and stated that it was agreed to continue talks with the United States - the United States and five other world powers, "in order to obtain a satisfactory long-term solution."
Gates, who was to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region to derencontrer the heads of the troops in Kirkuk and Irbil Kurdish .
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, especially regarding boundaries, ownership and revenue sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict to avoid any delays in US plans to reduce the number of US troops, 115 000 to 50, 000 Proposed by the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm anxiety Kurds on withdrawal pending. US officials cited Gates telling Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and independence within a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you. "
In aging China, a change of direction.
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda poster of the lecturing, "Mother Earth is too tired to take in more children" and "A baby most is more a tomb."
They have learned the lesson so well that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and the aging of the population, have radically changed direction this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instant and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and our energy to one child.
We are left with no second, said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources and has an 8 month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of notoriously only children with good cheeks and spoiled, nicknamed "little emperors," a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents 60 years and older will explode, 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This figure is well - above the global average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is worse in wealthy coastal cities with highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people 60 and older accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Directeur de la Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Commission de la Population Municipale de Shanghai et du Planning Familial) a d√©clar√© que les couples fertiles devaient avoir des b√©b√©s afin "d'aider √† r√©duire la proportion de la population vieillissante et d'emp√™cher un manque de main d'oeuvre √† l'avenir".
Shanghai is about to become "too old - but not as rich, though - that developed countries such as Japan and Sweden" she said.
A gradual attenuation.
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is today undoubtedly the most controversial requirement introduced by the Communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay huge fines - up to three times their annual income - and suffer discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have attributed to the police on duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for natural resources, while lawyers for human rights have denounced abuses in the enforcement of this policy.
In rural areas, some in authority have forced women pregnant with a second child to abortion.
In addition, many couples have used selective abortions leading to boys ratio - Abnormally high girls.
In recent years, officials of the public authorities have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they gave more exceptions to the rule - including residents of cities, ethnic minorities and the cases in which the man and woman are already only children - and in 2007, they softened their hard lot of slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research (Research Institute of the population) at Peking University, said the central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such that allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who has the right to have a second child and how to apply for authorization.
The city government dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet with couples in their homes and slip leaflets under their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response.
While officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in couples wishing to file requests a second child after the launch of the campaign, the most urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan with a population of 115 000, for example, still receives four to five applications per month.
The leaders of Shanghai, disappointed, argue that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 - slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of Family Planning Committee in Caolu town of Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and they are legally allowed to.
But like many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, say - they, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly believe that the one-child policy is a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
It's true, it robs us of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
This is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, Head of Human Resources, said she did not want a single child because she was a she - even. "We were the center of the family and had a habit that everyone takes care of us."
We do not have the habit of taking care of someone else and we really want to take care of others. "
Chen Zijian, 42 years and owns a translation company said more bluntly.
For couples with two working, middle class, that lower birth rates, said - he must be selfish to be successful.
People from 20 to 30 years have grown up watching their parents fight in the early stages of capitalist China and do not want to self - this lifestyle, said - there.
Even one child takes time his parents said - it.
A mother must give at least two years of his social life.
Then there are the problems of space - "You must change your apartment" - and planning - "When your child has only nine months, you have to write a CV for a place in the best mother. "
Most of his friends are ready to experience this once, Chen said, but not both.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, says - it.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
The UN group of draft plans for reducing emissions.
The climate conference, sponsored by the UN - until now characterized by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations - came back under the spotlight Friday, due to the publication of a document outlining the reductions ambitious greenhouse gas emissions over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations shouldering most of the burden in the coming time.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as much as he lit the path to take.
But he was seen as a major breakthrough in the negotiations that lack of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Written by a special working group of the UN, the text does not say how rich countries give to the poor to support the global warming in the short and long term.
And offers a wide range of options to key issues, including how the developed economies and new emerging economies could reduce their carbon output and what would be the upper limit of the increase in global temperature that those responsible would willing to tolerate.
It gives flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Washington Representative of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, reviewed a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what describes the Executive Secretary General on Climate Change of the UN, Yvo de Boer, as " the complete picture. "
It shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which industrial nations collectively reduce their emissions by 2020, from 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990, while major developing countries during the same period, would reduce their 15 to 30 percent.
Overall, countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent for 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched the negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $ 3.6 billion a year for the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change - to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
But on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, Representative of the United - States at the climate negotiations has rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared with voluntary efforts by the major emerging economies, if they - were not financed by developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration gets tougher with China that the Bush administration has been there two years ago.
The United - States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of major developing countries, says Stern also regretted that the text did not insist enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Vice - Chinese Foreign Minister He Yafei has said the US chief negotiator, or lack of "common sense" or was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the United - States does not financially assist China in the fight against global warming.
With future economic trajectories of the major world powers involved, faults have appeared both in the third - world and between industry and the emerging economies.
The current battle is more about the rescue of individual economies as saving the planet, with China and the United States - United quarreling about their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more boldly.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate of Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though the country had become more vulnerable aggressive in their attempt to make the big emitters accountable for their actions.
It really is a game in which developed a new economic hegemony, said Ulate, who is also Advisor climate for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change indicated they would continue to put pressure for a treaty requiring legally in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say the negotiations will lead to a minimum, a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, has drafted a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge - Metzger, Head of Unit climate of the European Commission, said that the action of Small Island States "put political pressure on the entire political process," in part by what they are now unified and they ask to emerging economies such as China and India, to act.
The debates have become an urgent matter, as delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most problems pending before the heads of government to reach an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Minister of Indian environment, Jairam Ramesh and Vice - Chinese Minister took their plane and rushed into the building of the Bella Center to attend meetings - camera and information conferences, in order to make claims that will be studied during the next week.
The real picture of the gathering - in which 13 000 people enter and leave the convention center every day - guitar players activists have nightly shows mocking the countries they believe are betrayed and that proposals are prepared and distributed on paper rather than emails - is a challenge.
The intensity only increased: almost all important ministers are here, and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We enter the big league, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice - President for Global Conservation International policy.
Lorries arrive.
Great - Britain, the first train to 225 km / h will redefine Monday syndrome.
At 5:13 Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the night to signal the start of a process that will mark a revolution transport in Great - Britain.
The first commuter train at high speed in the country will reach 225 km / h, while it will spin Ashford, Kent, London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Minister will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first Javelin commuter train outside London.
He hopes that the new service will allow Great - Britain integrate an international network of fast, reliable and trains link the major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland in London.
Small backwoods become thriving suburban cities, times of business travel will be much shorter and the passage of the plane and car to train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing road congestion.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the battle inevitable planning and the dangers of fears for the environment may slow the British high speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãTwo (HS2), a company created in January for the government to make a feasibility report will make its paper to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will enable it to obtain a detailed map of the route the next step planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five meters of the urban area and sites where the environmental impact may be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters in the final itinerary.
It is also expected that HS2 presents three options for greater high-speed network, going north.
Lord Adonis will meet in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration where a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will separate into two in or near Birmingham, with a branch going west Pennines √†Manchester and Scotland and one going north - east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will pass through Scotland.
"This seems to be the best performance option 'said a professional rail.
When this is completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a one hour trip today.
The proposals will allow the train to travel 400km / h, making it the fastest UK network in the world.
The initial layout is designed to allow trains 400m in length and can carry 1,100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can run on a line London - Birmingham.
A terminal can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be required.
Given the space constraints, it is anticipated that existing station will be enlarged to accommodate the high-speed network.
Experts from the rail industry say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes or not the project should be put in place, but more extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if he starts the machine, the network must be built piece by piece.
The trains will first have to roll out of high speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, keeping journey times between London and Scotland than three hours.
This appears to be the best for a passage from planes to trains, providing a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers pay back the loan for ¬£ 75,000 orangery Tory.
Alan Duncan, Senior Tory member of parliament, made payable to the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to pay the cost of an orangery he built his house in his constituency.
The party official who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were "maintained", increased its borrowing ¬£ 75,000 to build an extension in oak to its second home in Rutland.
He was permitted to charge additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds a month to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities have received complaints at that time - and there have not been interviewed by Sir Thomas Legg, who runs a check of members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan said that complaints could be "clearer or simpler."
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
The surrounding homes were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground - to - floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the office emoluments says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda at home, describing his plans as an orange grove.
The neighbors describe as a "porch for fun."
He was not asked Mr Duncan to give an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation made by the Committee on Privileges and standards of Commons on its loans prior arrangements.
The Committee was cleared last month of any accusation of non - compliance, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal security of the loan of ¬£ 271,406 from his London property to the house of his constituency he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr Duncan claimed about ¬£ 1,400 per month of loan interest until March of last year.
In April, its applications have increased by over ¬£ 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on the loan RBS Mr. Duncan was not changed at this point - there, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the loan of ¬£ 75,000.
The RBS standard variable interest rate increased from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, without moving since.
The latest publication of Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan kept asking ¬£ 1,250 in May.
Duncan lost his position of Head of the shadow cabinet in September after an undercover reporter was so - called filmed saying that MPs had to survive "on budget" after the expenses scandal.
"In fact, it is now national, you must live" on budget "and you are treated as" the m ... e ".
He said: "I spent my money on my garden and I asked for a small part, based on what was correct.
And damn I could have asked, but I did not. "
The member of parliament, a millionaire from his former position as oil trader, started having to explain its spending in May after it appeared he had asked thousands of pounds for his garden before agree with the office of the costs that it "could be considered excessive."
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the lawn ¬£ M Duncan in protest after it was revealed that he had asked ¬£ 4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing, last night, Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements approved by both the office expenses and Legg."
He added: "There is no evasion problem or development or use of rules or anything.
It was quite clear in the rules, authorized, etc ..
It could not be clearer or simpler. "
Faithful, come all see the Advent calendar of Brighton.
Brighton beach cabins have found a new way of promotion for the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, a group of alternative church that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their booth for each day of December, using as a theme of Christmas songs.
The event began on December 1, while the visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 17:30 to 18:30 each day, with pies and mulled wine served free.
Christmas songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin features the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a marketing assistant TV Hove, is an unpaid priest of the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We hope that religion is closer to the people in a society post - Christendom.
"As a church, why wait - that people go into a strange old building I think the Church should be close to people and celebrate more exciting way?.
"The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Advent calendar of beach cabin came just after a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experiment and represent that through spirituality. "
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, worldwide and in Copenhagen, where the police made hundreds of arrests.

This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), from the lips of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells was finally declared the end of September had "lied" to the author of the documentary.
If the court refuses to drop the charges, Mr. Hummel has called for a trial that would allow him to present evidence of his argument.
The prosecution for his part reiterated the arguments already developed in the first instance, namely that no drop charges could be seriously studied as Roman Polanski would not appear in court.
The filmmaker, 76 years old, fled the United - States in 1978, before sentencing, for "unlawful sexual intercourse" with a minor 13 years.
He never set foot in the United - States since.
Deputy Prosecutor Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, told Polanski "must be there to attend the hearing."
In this case, means - we send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski), but also to other defendants, it is possible to escape, asked Ms. Asayama?.
For her, the filmmaker "asks a favor at court, while despising his authority."
One of the three judges - who now have 90 days to make their decision - stressed also that "there were other alternatives to flight."
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to seek the dismissal of charges against Roman Polanski.
Counsel for Samantha Geimer, the victim, has also claimed, once again, the end of the proceedings.
Recalling that his client can not stand to be harassed every twist of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the process was fair.
Thirty - two years is enough. "
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on September 26 on US arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was under house arrest at his chalet in Gstaad, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, hampered by the rising dollar.
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction Friday in a market torn between indicators better than expected in the United - States and the rising dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.

The broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 0.37% to him (4.06 points) to 1106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, noted Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains within narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very weak and I think that will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better than expected economic indicators, which "helped to improve market sentiment about the strength of the economic recovery," summarized analysts at Charles Schwab.
In the United - States, retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and more than expected.
The US consumer confidence has also recovered strongly in December to 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the index from the University of Michigan.
Indices were, however, hampered by a further rise in the dollar, the highest in two months against the euro, which "pushes down sensitive sectors in the economy," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank .
Technology stocks have lost ground.
The bond market fell.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.540% against 3.482% Wednesday night and that's good for 30 years at 4.497% against 4.492% yesterday.

Their most beautiful memory will probably remain the draw in Cape Town (South - West) for the June 2010 FIFA World Cup, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I went to people I never thought to approach.
I will definitely come back for the World Cup - 2010 enthuses Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news of Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," according to his son David.
The news of Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", said on Friday his son David on his arrival at Los Angeles airport, where he had to go to his father's bedside in hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
It is very strong, it is going very well, said David Hallyday press on leaving the plane that brought him to Paris shortly after 1:00 p.m. local time (2100 GMT).
The son of the singer, looking relaxed, assured that he was going "very fast" in hospital Cedars - Sinai in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a herniated disc on 26 November in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent suffering and to administer treatment to him," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at the hospital Cedars - Sinai in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a herniated disc on 26 November in Paris.
The singer had to be operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday because of significant injury resulting from the intervention.
Laetitia his wife went Friday morning at the French lyc√©e in Los Angeles where educated their daughter Jade, to attend a school play, found a photographer from AFP.
The head of orthopedic and trauma surgery Piti√© - Salp√™tri√®re, Yves Catone, announced Monday that he would travel to Los Angeles with the singer.
Producer violently challenged Dr St√©phane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on 26 November in the International Clinic of Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Mr. Camus said.
I've heard of a possible future legal proceedings, he said.
Jean - Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday had "gone too fast for Los Angeles, with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon."
I had this doctor online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and it had stunned me, since I had myself - even two herniated discs, he added.
Shortly before RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "left without drain, without anything" after his Paris operation.
Dr. St√©phane Delajoux is well known in the art world.
He had made the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before his death, in a clinic in Neuilly - sur - Seine where he was at the time.
In 2007, he also made the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove a hematoma following a brain hemorrhage.
But it is also a doctor at the bad reputation, repeatedly condemned by the courts, in medical malpractice cases and for tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scruples" pursued "regular" before the Bar Council, which is "far from commendable."
After several days of silence, Dr. St√©phane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
One - has indicated that the intervention was "perfectly smoothly" and that post reviews - operative were "normal".
The operation "was not haemorrhagic and therefore does not require the installation of a drain," he added.
In any event, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have increased since this summer, seems brackets.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (Amiens, ed) as expected, it seems very short, Mr. Camus said.
The increase UDF combination tone and sum the New Center to stop using its acronym.
The UDF association controlled by the MoDem of Fran√ßois Bayrou, has responded Friday to the takeover attempt of the president of New Center, Herv√© Morin, the initials of the ex - Giscardian party, putting the notice to stop use it in any medium, under penalty of prosecution.
Herve Morin has publicly announced its intention to recover the UDF acronym, ruling that Fran√ßois Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy having reached out to the left.
The defense minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday to the National Council of NC.
To support his approach, he has received support from the deputy Herv√© de Charette (ex - UMP passed NC) who claims ownership of the UDF brand for having been the first to drop in 2004 to the National Institute of Industrial Property .
But Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by Fran√ßois Bayrou friends who do not intend to let dispossess her silence is to launch a formal notice to the Minister and MP, requiring them to do more use the initials and their transfer ownership of the brand, under penalty of prosecution.
You have multiplied in recent days, the statements that you were going to propose to your political movement of + resume + UDF acronym, the association wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 officers, including Fran√ßois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez the modem, and Senator Jean Arthuis the centrist Alliance.
You've also seen fit to follow on your hardware and activist on the cover page of your site, the name of this movement, the center + New + slogan + UDF + today, also note the signatories mail.
As you are aware, you have no right to use this mark, says the UDF office shall send the NC remove "immediately refers to the name of the UDF in any medium as well as (their) website. "
He also asked Herv√© de Charette "to transmit the property of (the) brand to its rightful heirs."
If you did not do it, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, prevent signatories.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "is a political movement in its own right since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "chosen" to leave in 2007 "to create a movement competitor as of others had done in 2002, to create the UMP. "
New center has therefore, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 it joined the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend the "moral and material interests" of the training founded by Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Herv√© de Charette, the office continues, "when he filed the trademark", it was "no longer member of the UDF for three years," but the UMP.
It takes advantage of the shockingly and fraudulently UDF acronym deposit abscence to perform on his behalf.
This dishonesty is being transformed into a crime, denounce - they before ironical about the strategy of NC: "It seems that in politics, as in life, it is worthy of being a self Name - same as trying to go public by fraudulently taking a name that has not right. "
Liliane Bettencourt affair: Fran√ßois - Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness.
The Nanterre court decided on Friday to judge the artist Fran√ßois - Marie Banier to determine if, as acknowledges the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he took advantage of a weakness of the octogenarian for rob a part of his fortune.
The photographer, 62, known for his pictures of stars, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, an offense punishable by a maximum sentence of three years imprisonment and a 375,000 euros fine.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter tear while holding the reins of the empire cosmetics L L'Or√©al.
But the 15th Criminal Chamber also ordered a medical examination of Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years old, should be conducted collectively by three doctors.
The heiress and principal shareholder of L'Or√©al has always refused to submit to such an examination, at least not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre prosecutor in the investigation.
DMPs Friday must submit a report by March 10, 2010, saying in particular whether Liliane Bettencourt could be in a state of weakness and at what times.
I think she will submit to it.
I'll talk to him, said the release of the hearing counsel for Mrs Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman.
For its part, the lawyer of Fran√ßoise Bettencourt - Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is excellent news (...) The expertise demonstrate that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady we must protect, he said.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has initiated criminal proceedings against Fran√ßois - Marie Banier, photographer and artist - key to - all, she accuses of profiting for years of weak his mother for one billion euros in donations in the form of checks, insurance policies - life and master paintings.
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt has always refuted having been manipulated by the photographer, it considers a longtime friend.
While the court had to consider the admissibility of the action brought by Ms Bettencourt - Meyers, the submissions of counsel have sometimes turned to the great family Friday unpacking.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer cites three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his lawyer, in which she said beware of the husband of Fran√ßoise Bettencourt - Meyers.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "could - you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Fran√ßoise, I never could talk to her since her marriage. "
For its part, the prosecutor of Nanterre has again held that the plaintiff was not entitled to take action, especially as a guardianship judge refused these days to grant his request to open a procedure judicial protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in court, it is not under protection and has no guardian.
Nobody else has to act in his place, "said the representative of the Crown, Marie - Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court ultimately decided that it would decide when the trial will be held on the admissibility of Mrs. Bettencourt - Meyers.
Managerial revolution or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain ...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies with respect to its employees, recalls the position of firms screw vis consumers before the marketing revolution: it is to adhere to employees "values" determined from above as it was once, to impose consumers products designed by technicians of the factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the business, the marketing revolution has given the trade opportunities strategies place ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected preference factors of customer return regularly!
A demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects managers.
This demobilization seriously harms the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including R & D and, even more, of economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE "requires all stakeholders (...) a proactive and forward-looking vision"; it requires from employees a commitment that revenue authoritarian management totally thwart.
This is why we call for a management revolution that would be to the employees at the heart of the business concerns as well as the customer.
The usefulness of any relative internal opinion surveys.
The internal polls -as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employee-go - they encourage this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First, because I could see that, faced with a new situation, any structure finally arrives, after many detours, primarily ... to what it has always done. !
- Next, because authoritarianism -one of power- pathologies increases in proportion to the size of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
From the engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behaviourist theory, recently reactivated by the "neuroscience" states - uniennes and widely disseminated, unwittingly, by the institutes' research and the media.
Thus, suggesting that it is possible to handle the "levers" (sic) of the executive commitment, a recent Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr it comforts leaders in a mechanistic governance posture, unsuited to world today.
Identify and measure factors of mobilization.
Instead, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, including adoption of a finalist vision of human behavior.
It integrates in any reasoning or governance practice, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is possible only if - it is clearly a way to realize some of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from the analysis motifonctionnelle adopt this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they consider their business based on a predetermined doxa which allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to "evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, enterprise leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and give them human resources management "in place".
They create fertile ground for concerted development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: the "just war" is right to praise Obama.
The American right Friday welcomed the speech delivered yesterday in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize for 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United - States.
The Conservatives, who had lampooned the award to Obama on October 9, cheered this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former candidate for vice - president in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Palin, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the USA Today, adding she had - even addressed the topic of war "sometimes necessary" in his memoirs that just been published.
War is of course the last thing I think that Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We must stop these terrorists all there - there, she said.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, has worked Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way of explaining his decision to send 30,000 troops Additional in Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, said that the president had made in Oslo "great job".
I found that the speech was really good, welcomed the former president of the House of Representatives, which has particularly appreciated the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential remarks.
In some part, I found this whole speech - to - historical fact, said Mr Gingrich, interviewed for the radio show "The Takeaway".
Former elected considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen "a leftist president" to remind the members of the Nobel Committee "they would not be free and could not give a peace prize if the use of force did not exist. "
Michael Gerson, former featherweight Bush converted columnist for the Washington Post, Obama delivered a "very American discourse."
In addition to appear in "world citizen" as "he always does," "he spoke as an American president," reminding Europeans "they live in a bubble of security that they have not created and they do not do much to preserve it, "said Mr. Gerson.
Among the few right not to be convinced, a hawk in the Bush era, the former ambassador to the UN John Bolton called the speech "dull, turgid and uninspired" on National Review Online website .
To the left of the President, the Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When you wrap the war in the notion of justice, one can easily justify the slaughter of innocents, he warned.
The press center - left remained, however, raved about the place of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel was awarded prematurely Obama called his speech "blockbuster" even for an experienced speaker for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," ignited the California daily.
Obama "gave the speech he needed," said the New York Times, it was "both dark and uplifting."

Whether we will instruct our members that no blockages, no blockade refueling centers.
But we can always have a few holdouts who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, hailed "a good agreement", even if it was "difficult to concede the increases on high salaries given international competition."
According to him, the increases will be around 170 euros a month for low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) praised the "historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT), meanwhile, spoke of "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the adjustment of travel expenses by 3%, and the holding of general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will address in particular the issue of a 13th month and modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a decrease of ‚Ç¨ 100 million in payroll taxes" was the subject of a government amendment to the supplementary budget bill for 2009, voted on the night of Thursday to Friday by National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on "in the same term."
The signing of TLF allows the agreement applies initially to member companies to this organization, and secondly, to any profession, if extended by the Minister of Labour.
She will be "in the shortest possible time," assured Mr. Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organizations can only delay the process.
FNTR denounced a "fool's bargain" because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to offset some of the carbon tax."
The Secretary? State for Transport has forced us to negotiate in the? emergency, not finding a shared analysis, but not to thwart the next turkey eaters Eve, lamented the Unostra.
For Otre, the agreement may "dig the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months."

The RATP short stretch of Saint - Germain - en - Laye and Nanterre in Boissy - Saint - L√©ger et Marne - La - Vall√©e.
Friday, about a second train was circulated at peak hours, and virtually no off peak train as planned.
Since Thursday, there was no crowd on the docks, Parisians are being organized.
So in the morning, the resort of Saint - Germain - en - Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially because of the lack of high school students.
A Boissy - Saint - L√©ger (Val - de - Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29 year-old engineer, explained getting up "half past one before, so be sure to arrive on time."
The Saint - Lazare station has not experienced saturation, said the SNCF, which had planned mentoring agents and law enforcement officials.

Turkish court dissolved the party pro - Kurdish fateful decision.
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled Friday the dissolution of the main party pro - Kurdish country, a move that was immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south - east and Istanbul.
This decision may greatly complicate the task of government, which just reach out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was disbanded because it had become a "hotbed of activities prejudicial to the state's independence and its indivisible unity," he told the press the President of the Court Hasim Kilic , after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to dissolve said Mr. Kilic, adding that 37 party officials, including its chairman Ahmet Turk and MP Aysel Tugluk, were banned from politics for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. T√ºrk and Mrs. Tugluk and confiscation by the Treasury of the party's assets.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned prior to the verdict that MPs leave Parliament rather than to serve as parliamentarians unlabeled.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Yal√ßinkaya Abdurrahman, who accuses the DTP of obeying "directives" from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe the DTP is the legal political wing of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, ensures that it has "no organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to call it - following a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with him.
The court verdict comes as the government has to reach out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to reinforce its rights to try to dry up the support of the Kurds and the PKK to end the conflict.
DTP leaders had stated that a dissolution could lead to increased tensions in the south - eastern Anatolia, where many protests against the head of the prison conditions of PKK Abdullah √ñcalan degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered outside the offices of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the largest city of the south - is mostly populated by Kurds.
The police fired tear gas and used water cannons, as demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails and stones with slings.
A hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. T√ºrk said that the decision of Justice would "deepen the despair".
Turkey can not resolve this issue (Kurdish, ed) prohibiting a party, he told the press.
The government formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also lamented the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of parties.
This solves nothing, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total sinking of the democratic opening launched by the government, said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
It can be expected, of course, a reaction of the PKK, he added.
Thursday, the PKK has claimed an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow can fall.
The wishes Wolfgang Brauburger is a well harsh winter.
But the head of the clearing service and sanding of roads (FES) makes it clear that this is not to annoy people.
It's just so that agents can test the vehicle technical and learn to control them.
And according to the m√©t√©rologues, this may well be for the weekend.
More than 300 officers and 120 vehicles are ready to tackle the snow and ice.
FES here follows an elaborate plan.
Mr. Brauburger says that once he starts to snow on the city of Frankfurt and the temperatures drop - below zero, large sandblasting vehicles cover 20 major routes (routes called A).
This includes busy streets, major arteries, such as the Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstrasse.
Firefighters access are also included, transportation routes transit, pedestrian zones and steep streets like Atzelbergstra√üe.
FES officers begin their service at three in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 km of road shall be salted with icing agent that adheres well, a 3-hour maximum time.
This is the reason why the FES service begins at 3am "so that the roads are clear when does traffic commuting."
There or it becomes more difficult is when the snow begins to fall √†7h30 the morning.
This causes problems, says the head of clearing service and sanding of roads "because no driver is willing to let the salting vehicles."
Then it stopped snowing, we take care of access roads and feeder roads - like Rat - Beil - Stra√üe.
Secondary roads and side streets come last.
Mr. Brauburger although it still causes knows few complaints.
At five in the morning the FES walking team sets off to clear priority deemed hazardous areas and passages.
As for bike lanes, the services of FES usually can not handle it.
Mr. Brauburger says there are in Frankfurt a special service that is responsible for monitoring the condition of bridges between 22 hours and 4:30.
As ice forms very quickly on these surfaces, salting vehicles involved as soon as the temperature drops - below 2 degrees.
Sometimes the police to call for this special service incase of need.
The cradle of the dinosaurs.
The Tawa hallae like other carnivorous dinosaurs: the biped was about 2 meters long and 1.50 meters high, its hind legs were powerful, his elongated skull was equipped with sharp teeth and bent, his short arms ended in claws in sickle and had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, she would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as reported Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine, Tawa hallae is an early dinosaur with these morphological features.
This animal lived there 215 million years in New Mexico faisait√† the time of the land mass of the supercontinent, Pangea and was towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt said the discovery of Tawa sheds new light on the evolution of early dinosaurs.
Indeed, it tells us about the relationship, the distribution and characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt excavating along with other paleontologists, on the site of Gohst Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis the Natural History Museum of Utah and a member of the excavation team said that sometimes they can find a dozen bones in a day which is absolutely unique for a Triassic sedimentary layer.
The scientists soon realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
Excavations have unearthed the remains of five specimens.
This discovery confirms theories about the early evolution of dinosaurs.
Researchers have dubbed the Tawa name after the word Hopi Indians to the sun god.
Sterling Nesbitt, it is a quite exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare and limited to a few fragments of bone incomplete.
All experts in paleontology do not share this enthusiasm.
For example Martin Sander from the University of Bonn is not that this discovery is particularly spectacular, however, he states that it confirms some theories about the early evolution of dinosaurs.
According to current knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth there are about 230 million years.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete which makes very difficult the classification of the earliest dinosaurs.
Experts wonder what time including lizards were divided into three major development groups theropod (carnivorous) which include Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptor emerged later and which descended birds, sauropods, long-necked quadrupeds and those related to them and ornithischians herbivores which include species such as Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is an early theropods.
This species has an interesting report of characteristics of both primitive and developed, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers have found evidence that suggests that the Tawa hallae had small air sacs in his bones in the skull, as birds are the descendants of theropod.
These small pockets of air make breathing easier birds compared to mammals.
It seems that in the Tawa hallae, vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis the Tawa is one of the oldest theropod with small air sacs in his bones.
As the related line of huge sauropods also had air bags and a light frame, it is likely that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive known dinosaur lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the dinosaurs had appeared there - there.
Therefore, the three major lines of evolution are divided and have spread from South America to the world that is all the land masses that formed the supercontinent Pangaea.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also found the remains of two other theropods that are not specifically related to him.
The three species can not descend from a common ancestor that would have migrated, argue the researchers.
Alan Turner of the New York Natural History Museum and co-author of the Science Studies magazine said there were at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are of course some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist at Bonn said there is an even older case, the silesaure, who lived in present-day Poland, which belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him this could give an erroneous view because there are in South America a large number of dinosaur fossils that have been preserved so that are found in virtually no other continents.
By cons, how dinosaurs - they managed to become the dominant tetrapods from the Mesozoic era when they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the branch of reptiles, remains a mystery.
At the Triassic period, dinosaurs share their habitat with many other reptiles, such as with the ancestors of the crocodiles and numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic dinosaurs are distributed throughout the world and promoting the development of many new species, while others, who were related to them, disappeared between the Triassic and Jurassic.
Such success is however not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two assumptions.
There could be a mass extinction that dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles disappeared.
Or else, the dinosaurs were better suited and they were able to eliminate competition in the field.
In any case, such a success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite favorisal'√©panouissement a group of animals that had also developed during the Triassic and since then languishing in the shadows: they were the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo.
The list is long and there are signatories worldwide.
There are those of professors from the University of Toronto, University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna and Berkeley, California.
There are those of lecturers from the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin and Bremen.
The evacuation by police from the casino JW Goethe University in Frankfurt making waves across the globe.
278 professors and teachers of the JW Goethe University, but also other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with protesting students at Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English condemning the police action claimed by the University Steering Committee.
Last week, the President of the University Werner M√ºller - Estler had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers gr√®veapr√®s as walls and works of art have been daubed with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories consider that the damage did not justify "a violent intervention by the police commando against the students and teachers who had organized their own courses."
The evacuation is an "unacceptable violation" of freedom of research and teaching.
The fact of focusing attention exclusively on the vandalism only serves to "delegitimize and criminalize protest" and tries to forget the reasons of the mobilization.
The University's Executive Committee has thus subtracted debates that would be a necessary.
Lecturers require that criminal prosecutions are immediately suspended.
The majority of the occupants did not take part in the deterioration.
Legitimizing protests.
Young Verdi union service sector and the Confederation of German Trade Unions (DGB) to show solidarity with the students.
The protests are only legitimate expressions of growing concern for our own future, said Alexander Klein, Regional Secretary of the young Verdi union.
As for the Minister of Science of Hesse Eva K√ºhne - H√∂rmann (CDU), she took up the cause of the action taken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Occupation and any damage to the premises is totally unacceptable, she said in Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday when the TV show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protest but do not accept vandalism, expressed the CDU MP Peter Beuth Regional Parliament.
The parliamentary groups of the opposition SPD, the Greens and the Left (Die Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the guise of some walls daubed to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left Party (Linke).
Instead of thinking about the arguments and demands of the students, it evacuates.
The Left Party has filed a motion that the sum of the Minister of Interior to submit a report on the conditions of the intervention of the police.
The new "Silicon - valley".
For a long time she had the secret city reputation, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of ten districts of Moscow, was under the Soviet regime, a place to search for the secret weapons, under strict supervision.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the center of Moscow, the town has a reputation for "being the" Silicon Valley "Soviet.
Important places of production and research in micro- and nanoelectronics located there.
From September 2008 representatives of Zelenograd established links with Riedberg, Frankfurt instead of science - with academic institutions and companies in the innovation center of Frankfurt (FIZ).
There were mutual acquaintances and Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Memorandum" closely. "
Signatories were the vice - Moscow Mayor Yuri Rosljak and the Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz project team leader for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, depart in Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific Exchange.
This is sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the Russian market expanding.
Conversely Russian scientists companies seeking contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of institutes and famous Soviet research companies.
There are the Institute "Moscow Electrical, large companies and Rosssijskaja Sitronics - Elektronika.
The town was founded in 1958 as a "socialist planned city" for research on arms.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City") takes its name from the wooded hills in the heart which research centers are located.
The S21 project: a brake Stuttgart.
Can not be placed high enough magnitude of Stuttgart 21 project.
To his supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
If we want. S21 is much more than burying a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden - W√ºrttemberg, in a hopeless chaos yards for a decade .
Stuttgart 21 is born of the spirit of the 80s.
The headend stations, with tracks that ended in the city, had a reputation at the time to be the relics of the art of the nineteenth century that were transport brake shoe effect of modern rail traffic because it was once a lot of time to get the locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, start - this is to do.
This is why the headend stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And Stuttgart also: a train through station, which is located half - way around the Magistrale Trans-European rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
The realization of the project will really start S21, although the visions of the 80s are long gone compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners have recognized that the cost to bury the station in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
Indeed, the headend stations no longer really pose input and output problems since there are modern trains, railcars and reversible car - driver on both ends.
However Stuttgart realization now we launch 21 next to the new route of the line inter - city to Ulm.
Regional and communal policies prevailed.
The company Railways is the game because it is the taxpayer who makes the risks fees the largest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic and not the public enterprise.
The urban point of view this project leaves relatively well justified.
An urban space is obtained which - if you believe the graphics computer generated planners - will be very green.
For the system of rail S21 is harmful.
The passing train station and the "expansion of the section are designed for human trafficking which were attributed - and this is typical of the 80s - a huge growth.
At "time there did not exist the competition of cheap flights.
The modern trade policy should first focus on strengthening the goods traffic because transport by rail is more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and it is much more serious concerns indirectly many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the draft Swabia.
This is the official figure.
Experts believe that 10-15000000000 are more realistic.
One thing is sure, in the next decade will miss this money for other junction points and bottlenecks in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport mentions threescore major projects.
One of the most important is the "expansion of the section through the Rhine valley 180 kilometers good.
Since 1987 this line is built slowly.
It would be really urgent support by building on the fungus.
But the S21 project is the effect of a brake shoe.
The route of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck traffic international freight, and in the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the judgment about the airport.
The regional parliament in Wiesbaden, the state government has raised the possibility of appeal to the judgment of the Administrative Court of Hesse on the prohibition of night flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU / FDP coalition had commissioned experts to examine the legal point of view the judgment of the Administrative Court, which is a document of over 400 pages.
The Court of Kassel was justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations concerning the ban on night flights in case the construction project of the airstrip north - west of Frankfurt airport would come true .
Permission to att√©rir for 17 aircraft between 23h and 5 am, as envisaged by the state government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against the night air pollution.
The coalition must have decided on 4 January if it wants to make an appeal against the judgment.
The opposition criticizes this period and attempts to pressure the government official to that - cirenonce to appeal to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Sch√§fer - G√ºmbel invites the CDU and FDP to return to their promise before the elections and that was to ban night flights. Otherwise, it will MEAN a total breach of a word.
It's damn hard to be allowed to keep his word, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al - Wazir, alluding to the FDP election slogan "We keep our promises."
The Minister Dieter Posch refutes reproaches Sch√§fer - G√ºmbel which claims that the state government is trying to still allow night flights by using "to pettifoggery and conniving."
It takes time to fine legal review.
The coalition does not take a decision on the basis of a "quick first impression".
It is necessary that the decision is legally reliable, said Stefan M√ºller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition regarding the statements of his fraction banning night flights is completely improper rangeland.
US banks repay the aid allocated.
Large US banks, hard hit by the crisis, break up their relationship with respect to the state.
Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had repaid the Treasury $ 45 billion (over 30 billion euros), corresponding to the aid granted under the TARP bailout.
The US television channel CNBC reported during a report that Citigroup was also planning to repay the aid received.
Banking institutions as well try to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of money, such as limiting the bonus awarded to the executive and the higher settlement costs.
Bank of America has launched a capital increase through the sale of securities to investors who told him 19 billion in new money.
The rest of the money comes from the bank's funds, which are met through the sale of several branches in other sectors.
Last Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis Managing Director of Bank of America has expressly thanked US taxpayers: capital injection has significantly helped overcome a difficult period.
The bank had assumed its capabilities by buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
Citigroup also plans to raise money in the capital markets in order to free themselves from the tutelage of the state.
The US bank could launch as early as Thursday a capital increase of $ 20 billion, reported CNBC chain citing banking circles.
The door - word of Citigroup did not wish to comment on this information.
In June the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they received.
Election accelerated.
Finally everything was still spent more quickly than expected.
Barely two weeks after the dismissal of the current reigning chief editor Nikolaus Brender position by the Board of Directors of the German channel ZDF, the successor is already named.
The commission wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey who heads the Berlin Editorial ZDF was the big favorite.
The chain declined to confirm, however - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it seems that there was also the desire not to further impair the Intendant of ZDF Markus Sch√§chter if the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is the candidate of Sch√§chter needed the vote of nine members of the Commission of 14.
The vote was not yet known at the end of the writing of this edition.
There are two weeks Sch√§chter had proposed to the Board to extend by five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender but it was rejected.
Only seven members of the Council had supported the renewal of Brender and 7 others voted against. Impeachment vote by Brender represented a bitter though predictable failure to Sch√§chter.
Indeed, the CDU's majority on the Board had already suggested several weeks before the vote, did not want to renew Brender in office.
This is Roland Koch, Minister - President of Hesse who had organized a league against the editor.
He refused the contract esteemed chief editor is extended on the grounds that the listening rate information ZDF emissions had fallen under Brender.
That's why the protests were still taking place, almost to the vote, criticizing the growing political influence on the ZDF.
At the end there was even 35 experts in public law who had interfered in the debate and who believed that the dealings Koch was unconstitutional.
But this will not help.
Peter Frey: that is - it?
Peter Frey was born August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied science - policy, pedagogy etles Romance languages ‚Äã‚Äã(Spanish).
He then worked at S√ºdwestfunk (radio body Rhineland - Palatinate) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (German daily national in scope).
In 1983 he became editor in the first at ZDF news magazine "heute - journal" (today's paper).
Then the journey continues: from 1988 to 1990 he was deputy editor - in - chief at the time; then Washington correspondent in 1991/1992, and then until 1998 he was chief and host of "Morgenmagazins" (bi-monthly news magazine show in the morning); until 2001 he was head of foreign policy department of the ZDF and head of the Berlin editors.
After the disgrace of Brender, while that - it had just been elected Journalist of the Year by the journal Medium Magazin, the Greens announced they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opponent to the Board, the Minister - President of Rhineland - Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the states should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty ZDF so the steward staff proposals can not not be blocked by a biased political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the removal of members of political figures ZDF monitoring committees.
Peter Frey, the likely successor Brender had cleverly maneuvered to the Board criticizing the commission vehemently in his decision to sack Brender.
With this proof of journalistic independence Sch√§chter was able to offer it to editorial position - in - Chief without losing face, as the Board of Directors can elect without being suspected of placing the the position a political partisan.
In arithmetic representations of parties, Frey is classified Liberal Left.
General cleaning in the university.
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the L√§nder decide to be more conciliatory: during a meeting between the Ministers and delegates of the conference of presidents, an agreement was developed stating that the working conditions of Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to overcome their studies.
They specifically agreed to reduce the weight of tests: a single examination must close the study module chosen.
In addition, the workload should be reconsid√©e to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
The political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The states have also committed to organize more flexible common structural requirements for courses of Bachelor and Master.
At the regional level, there should not be any different regulations from one Land to another.
Fewer exams.
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Minister of Education of the L√§nder and the rectors of universities have always mouth the buzzword "studiability."
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a concrete meaning.
The accreditation council has decided to significantly reduce the number of certain examinations: "Each module should normally be reached by a single examination," can - reads a document of about thirty pages on future admission requirements academic cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, President of the Accreditation Council declares that significantly reducing the burden of examinations should be able to stop slippage, which interfered considerably with studiability.
The "studiability" should moreover be in the future, the decisive criterion for the organization of studies.
The modules like the background must be examined carefully to see if we can not avoid this feeling of suffocation that is sometimes heard in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge on RAID Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Defence Minister Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and the flexibility necessary to enable and encourage personal initiative."
The new regulations will affect access to new university courses but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "recertified" every 5 years, which means, however, that it was only in 2015 that all cycles have been examined.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory which depend on the Accreditation Council created by the L√§nder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exerted some pressure on the states that they weigh on the agencies to ensure that programs are not too heavy and not too strict system of examinations.
In some states, universities and technical colleges have already agreed with regional departments to take appropriate measures.
Rhineland - Palatinate is so far the only state to have agreed to grant more resources to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutorials programs and strengthen educational guidance offices and the offices of the examinations and International Relations.
The states and universities provide for that a budget of 10 million euros.
In early 2010, the government wants to table in Parliament an amendment to the law on higher education institutions.
After that it will take more than a passing one exam to end his studies.
The organization of studies to be more flexible, more must be able to guarantee the recognition of statements other notes higher education and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, "studiability" of all university cycles will have to be considered.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition were again discussed the issue of conditions of education in the country.
The decisions were appreciated but critics were heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students said he would welcome the organization of educational policy will happen in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strike, the students as individuals should be able to speak a little.
Future graduates of higher education is received the support of the President of the delegates of the Rectors' Conference (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the student experience is very helpful," she said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the L√§nder with which HRK working on a common reform.
For the Union of Education and Science (GEW) decisions made in Bonn does not go far enough. It claims the right and the opportunity for each graduate of Bachelor to enroll in a Master cycle.
Andreas Keller board member of the GEW requests that the states provide students with Bachelor of today, tomorrow there will be enough places for studies in Master and study conditions as good as possible.
The states must hire more lecturers.
For cons, the Ministers of Education have not discussed the possibility of easing access to the Master.
More than a footnote on page Herta M√ºller.
It is with these words "Check in Germany and it's beautiful, almost more control ..." begins a work of the poet Werner S√∂llner, in which he thematizes in snatches of sentences troubling, experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany that gained freedom but lost along its linguistic territory.
Werner S√∂llner, born in 1951 in Banat in Romania, was first a German and English teacher in Bucharest and, eventually, collection manager in a house "edition for youth before settling Frankfurt Main.
S√∂llner received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the coveted chair of poetry of Goethe University Frankfurt and since 2002 he is Director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the artist's house in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He did a lot of attention in non-literary circles last Tuesday at a conference in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files."
Visibly unsettled and embarrassed, S√∂llner made a statement in which he admitted to his colleagues writers German - Romanian as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer he had worked as an informant for the Securitate secret police.
S√∂llner received in 1989 the price of the German language in conjunction with some of the participants.
Enlistment tests had started insidiously in 1971.
I am, S√∂llner concluded, "So someone who has not sufficiently been able to resist intimidation tests of the Securitate."
The poet Werner S√∂llner is the informant Walter (Walter IM).
Almost simultaneously with the honoration Nobel Prize for Herta M√ºller and exemplary literary quarrels with the mechanisms of power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and particularly the community of German authors from Romania, in a case that clearly shows the abysses and baseness of a political system based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner S√∂llner is, as far as we can tell from the current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own Securitate file, IM Walter played a role, provides the literary scholar Michael Markel after confession S√∂llner and it refers to the positive influence IM Walter had interceded on his behalf.
"He was able to draw from every difficult situation to" epoch ", according to Markel.
Markel felt the need Moralde make that comment.
The form in which S√∂llner made his statement and before the public was unexpected, however, the confession of a former dissident of its collaboration with the Romanian secret service is in fact, not so surprising.
Germany is a nice reserve for Securitate spies had already written Herta M√ºller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of his own case.
We can assume that the victims have made speculation and sometimes have guessed what real names were hiding last names Sorin loans, Voicu and also Walter.
In contrast to Germany, where meanwhile consulting Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude to the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confused.
A systematic clarification was constantly thwarted and hindered in the past years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work with the assimilation of the Securitate Archives (CNSAS), but the return of records rather dragged since.
There is a law in 2005 that defines records management.
The influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very large, is confirmed by an interview with a former head of the Securitate Temesvar who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize to Herta M√ºller, spoke so very disdainful toward the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end no one had questioned once.
The infamy of power believed to express themselves here without any gene, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Of course, many inevitable issues associated case S√∂llner as happens so often in the context of hidden guilt.
Why now? That was robbed? The weighted response of listeners to the confession of S√∂llner, give hope that the rest of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge by accusations and shame.
The genesis of the work of Herta M√ºller, who yesterday received the Nobel Prize, is more than a footnote on page.
Turmoil in the Champions League.
It seemed that a representative arrived there, dressed to the nines coming straight for a nice Christmas party, which the manufacturer of sporting goods had spread his goods when the new VfB coach Christian Gross went to midnight a quarter in a Mercedes C class, he just called an orange plastic bag supplier in hand.
The man, whose bald head drew attention, let himself be led in the city that it was even stranger.
Otherwise we could have taken her fifties - even the wheel - he had not been drinking and he was not drunk with happiness.
He had spent a pleasant evening but tomorrow it was back to work.
For it is now that it would begin.
The words of Switzerland that we had engaged three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the last sixteen," ie in the Champions League with our 3: 1 against Unirea Urziceni Romania "but we must not be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight to not fall."
The "big job" ahead Sunday.
There he is again in Mainz the results of the Champions League every day.
And it will overcome the weaknesses that surfaced after the three goals expeditious Marica (5.), Tr√§sch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Draw.
The eighth finals of the Champions League (leg 16. / 17. + 23. / 24 February / leg 9/10 + 16 / March 17) will be drawn on the 18th December in Nyon.
The entry joy fulminant function of the successor of Babbel was therefore moderate.
And joy was not only in moderate one who had a chance, who had sent to Stuttgart professionals destabilized, unfailing motivation and fun to play.
I went to see the players and I told them they had to focus on their strengths, I advised them to "be courageous, explained the" plumber of souls "- Gross - the recipe for success that sounded so bienmais who had more effects with Babbel healer.
It triggered some magic confessed Jens Lehmann - Babbel supporter - "in football when there is a new impulse he sometimes spends things you never thought possible."
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks break for injury, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to its dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" recorded in a proverbial "fresh wind" and the working method of the new leader: "C 'is someone who takes action and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
But apparently Babbel had missed.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed, warned the manager Horst Heldt.
For now, VfB Stuttgart needs above tenacity.
Like Gross, players and the manager are careful not to overstate the victory against a completely outdated and weak defense of the Romanian guests.
They also won in Glasgow before having four days later a bad awakening in Leverkusen with 0: 4, objected Khedira.
Horst Heldt, manager, reported that they had actually reached one of the goals of the season but that there were others who were still far away.
We have not passed the difficult course.
Heldt that the day of his 40th birthday does not have the heart to party, even after the first home win for three months, the events of the week - end a television interview with Jens Lehmann goalkeeper made bounce just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others take and not Jens, thwarting Heldt, in response to sharp criticism of Lehmann.
He accused the leadership style of weakness and said it had decided to change coach under pressure from pubescent fans.
Lehmann was also considered as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy makes her day off after matches have been deleted him.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by selfishness" sank Heldt and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were more likely to become friends for life both in their forties.
In any cast, they agreed to everything else, that is to say without the prior work of the group by the coach replaced, strong and combative sports representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "largely in the success" retorted Heldt and Lehmann in chorus - and even the man in the plastic bag nodded.
World Championship heavyweights.
Combat hot Berne: Kevin Johnson caused the challenger constantly verbally and gestural world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve hard rounds Ukrainian defended his title of world heavyweight champion after the WBC version of the federation.
Unanimously judges it imposed on points.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko retains his title of world champion heavyweight.
WBC federation announced on the night of Saturday 38 champion had won a victory on points with the judges unanimously reached against American Kevin Johnson (120: 10).
For the third time Klitschko defends his title with honor since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously the Ukrainian had already twice won the title of world champion WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately he failed KO awaited.
Klitschko came out victorious 39 times in 41 professional fights, had to admit defeat twice due to injuries.
Johnson challenger had to accept his first defeat at the 24th fight.
In the Arena in Bern, before 17,000 spectators, the big Klitschko especially wanted to dictate the fight from a height of 2.02 meters, by its against the left.
Johnson, eleven smaller centimeters before the duel, announced the end of "Klitschko era managed to avoid the blows of the champion, preventing Klitschko to come into play against his dangerous right.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, has mostly tried to make the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures his shots only reached very rarely the champion.
It is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having passed with Klitschko the distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger had done a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko calling him a "zombie villain" who "is not really capable of."
Friday during weighing, the champion could not help but provoke Johnson making him drop his sunglasses nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth win since the comeback Klitschko.
Klitschko has emerged again in his fourth fight since his comeback October 11, 2008.
After a break of nearly four years, he had beaten to "time the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered" his "WBC belt that he had previously give up without a fight.
This year, defending his championship, he won the battle against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba in September against Chris Arreola in the USA.
"I just took a shot in this fight and am in perfect shape," said Klitschko to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring in the family the four most important titles.
His brother Wladimir is champion WBO and IBF federations.

This summer, Haye had canceled a game against Vitali Klitschko to be held in September.
It seems that his promotion company plans to play this game at Wembley this in London.
The Kunduz case.
Frontal attack from the opposition: the parliamentary leader of the Greens, J√ºrgen Trittin, accused the defense minister Guttenberg lie in the case of the Affair Kunduz.
The SPD and the Left party (Die Linke) ask the Chancellor explained.
Hamburg / Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on the air attack in Kunduz, the opposition criticized the Defense Minister Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) have d√©lib√©r√©mentdissimul√© certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "made an untruth" on the deadly strike two trucks - tanks in September, said the parliamentary leader of the Greens, J√ºrgen Trittin on Saturday in the news program of the ARD channel " Tagesschau "(the 20h log).
Clearly, this means that he lied.
The order was given to kill in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Force Assistance in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in essence, the content of the report available to NATO and was read by Mr. Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations lafrappe the goal was actually not to destroy the stolen truck, but was well eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured during the US air attack that was launched at the request of the German Colonel Georg Klein, Kunduz military commander.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left prayed Saturday Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to rule as soon as possible before the federal parliament and reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
J√ºrgen Trittin and party colleague Renate K√ºnast of the Greens believe that Angela Merkel should make clear whether the targeted killing strategy is part of the Afghan government policy f√©d√©ralet if the chancellery, the army and the intelligence services approved this new strategy.
The door - Government rejects these criticisms word.
The Chancery has in no way influenced the military interventions in Afghanistan, t - he said.
Saturday, voices were becoming stronger doutesquant to express the real reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert, as it had been presented by the Ministry.
According to information from SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had given to Guttenberg about the attack trucks - tanks were both correct and complete.
Officially they have concealed the existence of the NATO report to the Minister and hidden some distracting details.
In the entourage of the two officials left yet heard that they had informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein and a report of the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert had meanwhile requested in a letter clarifying the facts.
So far it has not received an answer.
Saturday, the Ministry declined to comment on the charges and referred to the inquiry of the Federal Parliament was going to be the following Wednesday to bring light on the facts.
The dream worlds.
Some see while awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It's not just for the mentally ill or under the influence of drugs, the boundaries between fantasy and reality merge.
As these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is fine.
When we are lying in our darkened rooms we can give ourselves unfettered dreams and wildest fantasies.
But one who, awake, experienced d "dream state, hears and sees things that others do not see, quickly reputation in our western world to" be mad or drugged, or at least to be " an original.
Such images and voices do not appear among the mentally ill or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is in question: it's the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, but sometimes leads the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to melt.
An awake conscious, taking the form of a dream can be in the most various forms, in the best case it is called visions, at worst crazy.
But even if the trigger and effect stand out, visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, drug experiences of New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the latter states shamans, psychosis and hallucinations are due to very process like.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the "balance of neurotransmitter substances in the brain - in the first place dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and ach√©tylcholine - breaks and that the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts often occur during schizophrenic psychosis.
The force of gravity has more power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dreams.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of - dream; Wilhelm Griesinger, a founder of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 "a great similarity between madness and dream" to Sigmund Freud's dream was even "a psychosis with all irregularities, fantasies, delusions and delusions that composes ".
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T becomes a character in a comic strip.
His body is two-dimensional garish.
The gravity has no more power over him, he hangs flush with the ceiling.
He feels a sudden.
Behind him winged creatures of the devil, grimacing, bloodied mouth showing teeth.
They pursue it, give it kicked with heavy flaming boots, throw it against the wall, he feels pain throughout the body.
Thundering voice, nasty, screaming, out of the walls and the radio.
He can not bear those voices who insult and humiliate.
Henning T. pulls two cables from his stereo, makes a loop and attach it to a hook in the ceiling.
He climbs on a speaker and the loop goes around the neck.
He jumps.
The loop comes off.
Let this be a lesson to you, shout the voices in a chorus to snatch the eardrum. "Go to a clinic and do - treat yourself!".
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he lived six acute psychoses, the last date of 2 years, the first in nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by the LSD.
Diagnosis: Schizoaffective psychosis - emotional, paranoid, moreover it is manic - depressive, he takes drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During psychosis I had terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
One for - percent of the population suffers at least once in his life schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics is the most common disease after depression.
In schizophrenia crisis, individuals can no longer tell the difference between the inner world and the outside world, they find themselves in a hyper arousal, which they may suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, of relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices - voices that control, that comment or interact.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person can not distinguish between the important and the unimportant, the brain can not filter out disturbing signals, the conscious is flooded with sensations.
Like dreams, psychosis opens the floodgates to a tide of ideas and fantasies after the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the psychiatry department of the University Hospital of Heidelberg (Psychiatry Allgemeine im Universit√§tsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is located in the center of the situation, with a meaning centered on him.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, it is like a dream, overcome by events and can not act on them actively.
This is why people with schizophrenia often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the ability to adjust to reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking is excluded.
To experience a once in a life of a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is basically preserved."
The thoughts and delusional hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real setting.
Why does our brain - it this kind of antics, is still a mystery to researchers.
Exceptional circumstances may lead everyone to momentarily lose perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies of twins have shown that genes are not the only determinants.
The researchers speculate that the persons concerned are tiny brain damage.
We assume that neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, says Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is how the anomaly of the neural system occurs and in addition the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or traumatic experience can be a trigger psychosis, if indeed there is predisposition.
Similarly hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain heater.
What's crazy, says psychology professor Erich Kasten L√ºbeck is that psychotic suffering from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs for disposal while others buy very expensive drugs to get purchase.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten brings ten years of reporting hallucinations and illusory phenomena pictures: last year he published his findings in a book entitled "The unreal world in our heads."
Hallucinations are well within the typical concomitant phenomena of psychosis but also an impressive number of many other pathologies.
It is one kind of psychological disorders such as depression or borderline but also migraine, "epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma.
It is surprising that in certain circumstances even the brain of healthy individuals is subject to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the brain areas that process sensory perceptions are overactive or not sufficiently curbed; brain when heated but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as a brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, heartache or exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of the participants acknowledged having made at least once in a lifetime experience a hallucination.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. 16, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg - Vorpommern and goes to high school.
A girl just be normal actually.
If it were not for the images and voices.
During recess, sometimes a boy, thin, with long brown hair, speak to him.
When she meets her friends are watching, amazed - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think that this shy girl is a whimsical dream but Sarah K does not dream, it is certain.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy as she sees and hears the girl who sat next to her on the bench.
It can even perceive his presence momentarily.
It's a nice feeling, she found this nice young.
Am - I crazy, wonders t - it sometimes.
But she knows that this young and other visions are not real and they'll disappear again.
At night the appearances are usually frightening.
Visions are often cumbersome.
When she's in class, sometimes it can take the course because the teacher is just going to present a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is visibly trying to explain the equations on the board.
At night the appearances are usually frightening.
When, in the darkness of his room, waiting for sleep that happens too infrequently and too late, she often can not distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, if the images she sees the grimacing faces or the girl with bloody cuts on his arms and legs are in front of his eyes open or closed.
Let - me alone, cries t - it to these creatures.
She does not speak nor his parents nor his friends, they take crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She had her tank last year and she lives with her friend.
There is one year hallucinations ceased.
Since she came into contact with the internet Kasten psychologist she knows she's not crazy.
Madness is also a desperate artwork.
When someone is socially isolated or not enough stimulation, the likelihood is great that he has hallucinations after some time.
I guess the brain n "is not busy enough, means that there is animation.
Sarah K., only daughter, was afraid of the other children when she was little and often played alone.
His hallucinations started when she learned at age 13, the man she called dad since she was old enough to think, no "was not his real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and real impressions and sounds, it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to distinguish between illusion and reality. "Every experience," according to Kasten "occurs in the brain, reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real. "
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy individuals do not differ fundamentally from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
Therefore Kasten advises patients to cherish hallucinations as a special talent.
There is a step between the dream and hallucination.
In our world too focused on consciousness was unfortunately quickly tend to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt - Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of clinical psychiatry and psychotherapy Florence Nightingale Hospital in D√ºsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful but also contains something positive, creator - the madness of despair is a work of art.
Schmidt - Degenhard studied the form of so-called oneiroid experience, a particular form of altered consciousness awakened by the dream.
The oniro√Ødes experiences are semi - complex dreams that are perceived as real by the one who saw them and can not differentiate the same dream when it is awake.
The "state of consciousness oneiroid occurs during trauma or in extreme situations such diseases for patients who polyradiculopathy fully aware, experience a motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt - Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, it replaces the real situation that undermines his life, by his own imaginary world that is dissociated of reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change in the world takes place but the actual situation is represented in the imagination.
This is in fact an intense form of means and interpretation, in a situation in itself intolerable, organizational capacity that is given to us men, not to sink into nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurich Peter Cornelius Classen, art historian also described his experiences in his book oniro√Ødes "heart change" as a backup action of "soul.
He is 49 years old, when his conscious on a journey of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by transplantation; Meanwhile, his body is doomed to remain still in intensive care.
Claussen delves into a world he created from scratch, visit foreign places, travel in time. He sees an old man in bed in a railway sanatorium, a robot at her bedside watching over his health.
He lives in the Middle Ages among the nobles who make blood-based drugs.
It is removed by a Greek motorcycle that takes him to his country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the firn Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
It is completely absorbed in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen these domestic trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a state quite different, writes - he describes his experiences.
Instead of dreams, memories from mental trips are extremely clear and detailed images even years later.
You could even say they are much more distinct and more intensive than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience shatters the horizon of our other daily experiences, as psychiatrist Schmidt - Degenhard.
Ultimately, delusions oniro√Ødes, psychosis, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how our internal representations of external reality are fragile even in sleep state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten "can cause deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite rewarding.
The first snow can fall.
Burda.
At 27, children will following the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen as CEO of Burda Publishing is an intermediate solution in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children take up the media group, he told Spiegel.
The holding company is to remain a 100% family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children.
The two children will inherit 27 years and are firmly committed to joining the company, said Hubert Burda, 69, at Spiegel.
All details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise in the future.
It will also see if they are able.
We can not impose its 7,500 employees without children whether they have the capacity to handle it.
This demolish children as well as the company.
Burda had announced last Thursday that it was withdrawing from the President position - Director - General in the month of January and that his successor was Paul - Bernhard Kallen.

He was initially responsible for the technology sector.
Thereafter he took over the Treasury sector ie he was responsible for the company's capital and after the departure of J√ºrgen Todenh√∂fer it also took the head of marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
Thus for the first time this is not a family member who is head of Burda editions.
Children Burda respectively 19 and 17, his son Felix would have today 42 years old, passed away a few years ago.
The nommination Kallen also serves to link the next 10 to 15 years. "
Burda said that the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always been held in families that are left lead by a capital bulimia, which made huge unfortunate speculation thinking they could climb higher and higher.
This has never been my strategy.
I have never had revede universal power, said Burda.
I really do not see myself in the role of tutor to the country like Springer could be and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken too much importance.

Mazda3 i - Stop: A sustainable sportsmanship.
Mazda intends to prove that sportsmanship is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just joined the Mazda3 shutdown system and engine start, called i - Stop, a device that, at least for now, is only available on the 2.0 petrol engine 150 horses.
This second generation Mazda3 is evidenced by the note she got a whole.
The details, the finishing of the vehicle, livability, behavior, mechanics, i - Stop ...
All these aspects are noteworthy about the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it appears that the front seats are ergonomics and excellent fixation.
The feel of the steering wheel is also particularly nice.
Continuing with the assembly formed by the control panel and the console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design, with numerous buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red blue.
This style reminds us, in part, the Honda Civic.
This is why we can say that both the Civic Mazda3, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, especially with the Volkswagen Golf, all want to surpass.
Continuing with the passenger, this compact Japanese car has an interior space more than sufficient to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Added to all this a large trunk with regular shapes.
The shutdown system and automatic engine start, at least for now, is only available on the two-liter petrol engine with 150 horsepower and six-speed manual change.
This engine is a joy. It is illustrated by its smoothness, low noise, its services and control of consumption.
Indeed, although the most requested Mazda3 diesel models are those who do not do a lot of kilometers per year should not exclude this i - Stop Motor Gasoline, both for his great speed for his comfort controlled consumption.
On the level of "equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sports, ie the one with the largest number of" series of elements.
Among the standard equipment, the lane change assistant (RVM) which eliminates the blind spot, controls traction and stability, cruise control, the photosensitive interior mirror, trip computer on a screen large size, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, Bluetooth and Bluetooth audio, and the 17-inch wheel alignment, are particularly noteworthy.
Moreover, as if this equipment was not enough, this version had the Premium Pack, which for 1500 euros more, includes among other elements of adaptive headlights bi - xenon and a BOSE sound system with disc changer.
Conclusion.
The Mazda3 2.0 i - Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is illustrated in particular by the quality of materials used, by its conduct and its level of "high gear.
In addition, those who do not do a lot of miles per year may opt for the version i - Stop only associated with the 2.0 petrol engine 150 hp.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros for Luxury finishes and 23 270 euros for the model tested, the Sports.
In consideration of this important fact, the Mazda3 will offer us every day a big dose of satisfaction.
"Premiere" luxury.

Stars more than ever dazzled us, dressed as elegant models sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe" as sophisticated qu'habitu√©e had opted for a "lady" dark.
The promise of FonPeek.
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to look at his email without the opportunity would - what to see some type of attachments or surf the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of fame to the states - the United States, when Time magazine designated him as one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see from the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a monthly subscription prices and very low, less than half of the cost, for example, the subscription data of the iPhone.
Given its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free service of life data, six times more than the Peek.
FonPeek presented yesterday at the "event Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is as limited as his grand - American brother, but has a surprise.
The price of the monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it means giving up the data when you cross a border or desperately seeking a cafeteria on Wifi (or connection Fon) to view his mail.
The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive and it's been that it should work.
Indeed, some operators have special arrangements and travel options, but for me, I need to have done her PhD in Physics for understanding and good glasses to read the fine print.
The repeated calls to order the European Commission to offer affordable roaming rates across Europe have a barely perceptible effect.
Outside his home country, one hesitates to use the data, and it was not wrong.
A small device like the FonPeek (always curious that while it is called Fon has no WiFi) offers this type of rates, means that operators are beginning to think differently and study different proposals allowing them return on their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other Internet searches.
No subscription and no hassle.
This is a connected device and you pay when purchased and not every month.
And that's what I hope one day to FonPeek: a call option with access to life as Peek already proposed to the States - States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I look at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just wish because I believe this is a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color.
Yellow is probably the favorite color of the first lady States - States.
If she went to Barack Obama's inauguration to the presidency of the States - United with a dress and a coat of this color, it has, in fact, chose the same to accompany the second time without no doubt, the most important of his life: the presentation in Oslo Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar pattern in both occasions: in addition to their likeness color, yellow pulling green with bright reflections, both times, holding consisted of three parts: the dress, jacket and coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So that a first glance "look, it seems that the first lady States - United follows the wake of the Princess of Asturias and chose to return the same outfits.
But wherein the fabric are cut both sets makes them very different.
If for the inauguration it was a thick lace, however, it was in Oslo printed velvet.
The accessories are also different: green shoes mid heel for the first time, and a similar model, but gold, this time - it.
The hairstyle also changed: the hair is now identified as she was released the last time.
75% of working mothers have had work problems because of their motherhood.
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is what reveals the "study" Fertility and careers of women in Spain ", conducted by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, conducted on 9,737 women 15 to 75 years, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers have seen their careers limited because of motherhood.
The "study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of the union and the number of children, if the woman works or not and the occupied job type.
Those that have no activity outside the home, work part time or have a very stable job, start earlier couple, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
In contrast, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, pushing the entrance into life as a couple and the first pregnancy and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 having a fixed workplace have their first child on average 3.7 years after s "to be installed in pairs. This figure rises to 4.1 among those working in the public sector." These data show that women with a stable job needed more time in their life to get it, which led them to reject the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of job held largely influenced motherhood, but less the start date of living, "says the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of "education is another factor that widens the gap of" marriage age for women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the education level, the higher they get married and have their first child later.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years, those who have elementary and higher education were mothers, respectively, for the first time to 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"Another disctinction also appears among women, according to their level" studies.
While those who have made elementary education marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, as were middle or higher level studies invert this program and give priority to obtaining a stable job as prerequisite to marriage and the birth of a child, "said Mrs. Delgado.

Both dreams were of magnitude. ".

A cowardly attack.
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 walked past her and our dog, blood - m√©l√© , saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six pounds, and without saying a word, they assen√®rent him two kicks that left him seriously injured dog.
Our indignation is huge because we do not see what there is fun to assaulting a free small defenseless animal which, moreover, was on a leash.
Added to this outrage of a lady who was walking quietly and when she insulted those individuals, came to fear for his physical, since a madman who attacks an animal is able to do the same thing to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, anyone weaker than himself.
L "episode took place around 17 pm on a Tuesday like any other, in a normally quiet neighborhood.
The dog groaned all day.
Of course we filed a complaint at the local police station although we doubt that it used to great - anything and do not touch the sensibilities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly assassins were Spanish.
Indignation has led us to denounce this.
We do not understand what is happening among young people that they find fun free mistreating defenseless animal which gives us affection, friendship and keep us company.
We do not know where's the proper education and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and FESVIAL, sets for helmet.
The manufacturer of Michelin tires, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (FESVIAL) launched a campaign to encourage helmet use, especially among younger riders, as indicated by the two structures today .
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of helmet use, since it is the only protection element enabling "avoid head injury, or death in the event of accident two wheels.
Michelin said the campaign was part of the lineage commitment to road safety, which "goes - beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer" and said it contributed to this goal through to Other actions for educational and informative.
This new campaign to encourage helmet use on two wheels, with the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in over 500 garages motorcycles in order to ensure wider dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles grew.
After nearly two years, the market for light commercial vehicles beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent a 12.6% increase compared to 2008 and, what is more important, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures of the employers' union Anfac manufacturers and Ganvam, the concessionaires.
However, it is necessary to qualify the good news, since the reference for comparison, in November 2008, was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
Consequently, despite rebounding last month, registrations accumulated during those 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if we add all vehicles that fall into the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from passenger cars, pick - ups, vans, light vans and light trucks chassis) 95 853 were sold.
The dark clouds that most affect their application did not mean dissipated. Indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases with external financing.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions implied by limiting bank loans must be added other factors such as the increase in unemployment or persistence of poor economic conditions.
Faced with this situation, and unlike passenger cars, aid to the purchase of the 2000E have little use.
In addition to individuals, independent and SMEs wishing to acquire light commercial vehicles under 3.5 tonnes with a level of "CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, can also benefit from it, but the number of operations speaks of him - even.
Yesterday at Ganvam, is again reminded of the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The association of dealers provides for 2010 similar to the ends for which it calculates a drop in sales (passenger cars and 4x4) of 19%.
Aid Emergency Brake is now mandatory.
As has been held with the anti-lock brakes and ABS as this will take place with the ESP stability control, emergency brake assist systems will be a mandatory part of European cars.
They are already mandatory on passenger cars and light commercial vehicles newly registered, while for the rest of the vehicles a waiting period was set up "to the end of February 2011.
The measure imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even though, by its mode of action, it can also help prevent many rear shocks.
The wizard emergency brake is increasing the pressure on the brakes in an emergency detected by the system due to kick given by the driver.
But it does not always keeps the pressure up "at the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for cars Bosch, a third of drivers involved in an accident could not press the brake before the collision, and half of them had not taken advantage of full force.
Up "in 1100 accidents.
The intervention of the aid, Revancha requires the maximum brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of "elements up" in 1100 in which fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented each year.
This reduction would be even greater with the popularization of so-called intelligent systems for emergency braking: a disaster is calculated in four with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, by a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting on the brake slightly.
If the driver reacts, he helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If he does not respond, and although the collision is unavoidable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
