A crucial step for the Balkans.
Since the world is focused on Iraq, North Korea and a potential crisis with Iran about nuclear weapons, Kosovo a little unnoticed.
The public will soon have the opportunity to again turn his attention to this province during a decision-making concerning his destiny.
States - United and their European friends have repeatedly announced their intention to take the difficult decision before the end of the year whether to separate Kosovo from the Serbia.
This crucial decision for the future of a volatile region will test Western determination and unity.
The talks this year in Vienna, orchestrated by the United Nations, showed that an agreement between the Serbia and Kosovo on a "final status" will not see the day.
Negotiations are continuing, but as with a lot of tact the UN negotiator and former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari at the Security Council, they are dead in the facts.
No Serbian leader will not accept the independence of Kosovo because nationalism remains the dominant political force in the country.
Indeed, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, Apostle of Serbian nationalism, has tried by all means to undermine the Kosovo interim Government.
He hurries to hold a national referendum this month - on a new constitution without serious parliamentary debate or the usual education of the public.
The main objective of this new constitution holds in its preamble, that maintains Kosovo in its status as inalienable part of the Serbia.
The Kosovo Albanians said that they will accept no link with Serbia, for very small it is.
Throughout the 1990s, they are virtually out of Kosovo Serb-administered by creating parallel institutions.
Their forced mass exodus of 1999 and the intervention of NATO who has followed, putting an end to the Serbian reign and establishing a quasi - State under the aegis of the United Nations, has made any other solution than independence intolerable.
Here a month or two, the Balkan contact group, is the United States, the Kingdom - Kingdom, the France, the Germany, the Italy and the Russia, will consider the recommendations of Ahtisaari on the final status of Kosovo and will propose may be a solution to the Security Council, which must make the final decision.
In public, all members of the contact group have attempted to leave the question of the final status of Kosovo opened, but in private the States United and some of his allies said to both parties that they would propose independence this year.
Some members of the Security Council, including Russia and China, see eye or remain sceptical about an imposed solution, and few Governments are for the division of the territory of another country, any ' compelling any circumstances.
The choice of the Security Council to approve independence largely depends the possibility to prevent a Russian veto, which will require considerable diplomatic effort.
The nature of the granted independence is also important.
The independent Kosovo must be able to live in security and its minorities must be protected.
The North of Kosovo, now largely under the control of Belgrade, must not be partitioned as all do as it no name.
To reduce the blow to the Serbia, must be that the Security Council avoids granting independence in a manner so distorted that the new State can not really work.
If the Security Council fails to take a decision on a final status, it will cause a critical situation: Kosovo will proclaim independence unilaterally and or all nations shall decide to recognise the new State.
If this happens, it is likely that the Serbs of northern Kosovo will declare their own independence.
At a minimum, the Serbia will strongly campaign against a any recognition.
In fact, the Government of Serbia already tries to convince the West to postpone the decision until mid - 2007.
He claims that if Kosovo becomes independent, the ultranationalist Radical Party will raise to power in the next elections, and believes that holding elections this year will prompt the contact group to push his proposal to the Security Council.
In addition, the Government has encouraged the leaders of the Republika Srpska of Bosnia to threaten to hold their own referendum on separation of a still fragile Bosnia.
And they continue to push, unsuccessfully, for the reference to Ahtisaari to prolong the discussions in Vienna.
The timing for the Organization of the constitutional referendum appears to be part of this delaying strategy.
Some hope that a postponement will stimulate violence in Kosovo and will push the West to reconsider the independence of Kosovo.
This tactic is may be operating.
Many EU countries are concerned about the implications of the withdrawal of territory of a country, as well as the impact of the independence of Kosovo on Serbian democracy.
Given the political instability of the Serbia, they question the damage that would cause a postponement in the short term, which would be primarily self - inflicted.
But postpone the decision would only allow to Kostunica to find new ways to make it even more difficult a decision of the Security Council.
The West should ignore the song of the sirens in Belgrade.
Serbian politics will be chaotic and unstable in the near future, and Serbian politicians will try to use this situation as an excuse to avoid facing the loss of Kosovo.
In the same way, linking the Serbia and Kosovo, whatever the circumstances, will be problematic.
But a failure to pronounce today permanently on the final status of Kosovo will produce a worse situation in the Balkans, will impede the advance of the Serbia towards the West and its membership in the EU term, condemn the ethnic minorities in Kosovo to a dangerous ambiguity and will jeopardize the fragile States like Bosnia and Macedonia.
The only realistic solution for Kosovo is independence.
If the Serbia wants to join the West, it should not give up the opportunity to leave trapped by its nationalist past.
Dawn new and dangerous for South Korea.
The decision by North Korea to expel UN Atomic Energy inspectors is one more reason to consider the election of Roh Moo Hyun to the Presidency of South Korea two weeks earlier as a tidal wave - of - historic.
The beginning of its mandate coincides not only with one of the most dangerous episodes of the Korean peninsula for decades, but his presidency will also witness of a litmus test of relations between States - United and the Korea of the South to a degree never reached in the past.
The victory of Roh on Lee Hoi Chang demonstrates a change of generation in Korean politics, with a youth determined to win freedom of movement in its relations with States - United.
In fact, the differences in generation were the decisive factor in the presidential race, replacing regional feelings that dominated every race for the Presidency before that - ci.
According to a report, more than 60% of the population of 20-30 years voted for Roh, creating a gap of 2.3% in the race for the Presidency which found themselves two men face to face for the first time in 31 years, fighting shoulder to shoulder.
The populist and nationalist Roh's position will be quickly and harshly put to the test by the reality when he will take his post in February.
But that associated the generational change that brought it to power with a strong will of the people to continue the commitments made vis - Ã  - vis the North Korea beyond the fact that North Korea continues to strengthen nuclear, and the recipe is complete for a disagreement with the States - United.
Roh, a self-educated man who manages the bar exam without ever attending university or his right, managed to convince its electorate that it would open a new era in politics, better reflecting an enriched South Korea and whose middle-class was reinforced, thus sweeping political games dominated by insiders, the regional disputes and sectarian strife.
His style and his rhetoric highlighted the new (for Korea!) image of a man of the people engaged in the removal of ossified networks of patronage and corruption.
For the first time in the modern history of the Korea, the presidential campaign has really been rather than debates on the central issues which the country is facing, rather than focusing on the parties and personalities.
Candidate Roh called for new relations between South Korea and States United, based on the principle of independence and equality.
Thus, he announced no longer wanting to be in the trailer of the States - United or want to go to Washington to take just the traditional photo. He also promised to pursue the policy of president Kim Dae Jung, called "sunshine policy", in its engagement with the North.
It is remarkable that Roh has won the election despite North - Korean to reactivate its nuclear reactors arrested since 1994.
A few years earlier, such a gesture would have sentenced the candidacy of Roh.
It has surpassed this obstacle without changing position on the commitment to North Korea shows that times have well radically changed.
The urgent popular desire for change rather than for a comfortable situation is therefore now the main concern of any average Korean.
Roh campaign also benefited from a growing trend to anti - Americanism.
The acquittal by a US military court of two American soldiers accidentally killed two Korean schoolgirls in June aboard their armoured vehicle triggered nationwide street demonstrations.
Although president George W. Bush apologized twice for the death of two girls, requirements continued to accumulate to amend the agreement on the status of the armed forces (Status of Force Agreement, SOFA), which governs the legal treatment of troops U.S. stationed in South Korea.
The Koreans insisted that American soldiers who commit crimes should be judged by the Korean courts.
This expression of wounded national pride was possible after the extraordinary performance of the southern party - Korean during the football World Cup last summer, which helped persuade the Koreans to the full maturity of their country, and which can therefore now defend themselves without the presence of 37,000 American soldiers.
In fact, there are many Koreans who now perceive the presence American, and not the Communist regime of North Korea as the biggest obstacle to unification.
According to a recent survey, only 54.8% of Koreans are still favourable to the maintenance of U.S. troops in their country, while 31.7% oppose.
These feelings will partly form the test of diplomacy that will give its forms to the Roh presidency early on, since it must rethink the relationship between the Korea and States - United at the same time where the Bush Government fusses about the nuclear ambitions of the Korea of the North and its role in the spread of weapons of mass destruction in rogue States.
For the moment, voters Korean, apparently insensitive to the threats presented by the nuclear weapons of North Korea, support the policy of Roh to maintain dialogue and economic exchanges with the North.
Chaired by Roh, the domestic politics of South Korea and its relations with the - United States and North Korea will require an update nine almost - total.
It may stand on the tightrope of maintaining the security in the peninsula while remaining committed vis - Ã  - vis America and keeping the support of its electorate?
Reconcile these goals would be a tough test even for the most experienced politician and the most cynical, then from there about whether president Roh can succeed is divination.
Any failure however implies prospects so horrible that nobody can really want him.
Each his path towards peace.
During the next three weeks, the Israeli army will engage in an unprecedented exercise: instead of defending the country against external enemies or terrorists, she'll do evacuate, by force if necessary, 9,000 Israelis from their homes.
The unilateral withdrawal of Israel is the culmination of a profound political change caused by two somewhat contradictory convictions that have characterized the policies of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon since 2003: firstly, that the "roadmap" initially launched by States - United is going nowhere and, second, that the status quo is untenable.
For Sharon, there is no doubt that the 9,000 Jewish settlers living among 1.2 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have no future.
Therefore, fault of negotiations, a unilateral withdrawal is the only sensible approach towards violence reduction and stabilization.
This policy has profoundly destabilized Israel. The settlers, mostly religious, but not all, felt betrayed by Sharon, "the father of the settlements".
Today is the Israeli left which, although to counter - heart, realizes that the new pragmatism preached by Sharon is may be the first step in the right direction.
Just as de Gaulle in Algeria, Sharon has redistributed the cards of Israeli policy.
Recent weeks have been the framework for massive demonstrations, some grazing violence. Number of settlers have decreed that they would not obey the orders of evacuation.
The army and the police have mobilized almost 50,000 soldiers to carry out evictions.
This approach by the force is traumatic not only for the settlers, but many other Israelis.
The coming days and the coming weeks can only tell us if the evacuation goes peacefully or not.
In the meantime, Sharon has paid dearly its policy.
Right-wing parties have left the ruling coalition, he lost his majority in his own Likud party, and his Finance Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has left his Government.
It is only by inviting the Labor Party of Shimon Peres in his cabinet that Sharon has managed to retain its parliamentary majority.
The question is obviously on the situation after the withdrawal from Gaza.
Initially, this withdrawal left many skeptical Governments, but they have come to realize, as they say in Washington, that was the only thing to do.
Among them, as well as among Palestinians, some are hoping that after the withdrawal from Gaza it will be possible to return to the roadmap and to resume negotiations that will lead to a final agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
It is a huge mistake.
Even if he is motivated by the best intentions of the world, hoping to resurrect the roadmap has nothing realistic.
Future negotiations should address the issue of the final borders between Israel and Palestine, the fate of 200,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, the status of Jerusalem and the problem of the Palestinian refugees of 1947 - 48.
The chasm between Israeli and Palestinian positions on these issues has not decreased since the negotiations missed of Camp David 2000, then that fear and lack of confidence were growing.
Attempt to embark on negotiations in such circumstances would not be only an exercise in futility, but could simply strengthen the remoteness and suspicion on both sides.
The failure of Annan's Cyprus project suggests that good intentions alone do not - and disagreements in Cyprus were tiny compared to what divides Israelis and Palestinians.
What is - it so possible to do?
The only rational way to proceed is probably recognize that unilateral approaches to each camp can further promote the cause of regression of the violence and the final reconciliation.
On the Israeli side, of other withdrawals from dozens of small colonies isolated from West Bank, forcing the evacuation of 20,000 to 30,000 settlers, may be politically feasible and would provide the Palestinians a contiguous territory in the West Bank.
On the Palestinian side, the consolidation of control by the Palestinian Authority with a dozen of militias and security services would be an important step forward.
The Palestinian leader, Abu Mazen, recognizes, but the question is whether he is capable.
The Palestinian Authority would also embark on the difficult path to tell refugees that, contrary to what have said 50 years of Palestinian propaganda, they will not return to Israel, but will have to settle in the West Bank and Gaza, areas which will be part of a final Palestinian State.
In an ideal world, the conflicts are settled through agreements and treaties.
But in real life, as illustrated by Cyprus, Bosnia and Kosovo, stabilization and the slow regression of violence can sometimes achieve the same goal, even without formal agreement.
Lack of plausible alternative, can only hope that it will also be the case for the Israelis and the Palestinians.
A new world?
BERLIN: As of old horses returning Frisky at the sound of the Bugle, the cold war strategists, feel their adrenaline rates increase while the anti-missile defense returns to the headlines.
Certainly, the missile defence proposed by Bill Clinton (reluctantly) and George W. Bush (enthusiastically) - and supported overwhelmingly by Congress - does not resemble the dream of star wars made by Ronald Reagan 20 years ago: NMD (Nuclear Missile Defense), American system of nuclear missile defence, is supposed to catch a modest warheads number and does therefore not total protection against enemy missiles.
However the issue rekindles old debates about deterrence, mutual assured destruction and nuclear arms control, and revives the rivalry between the nuclear powers at the time where nuclear weapons have lost much of their raison d'etre.
Oddly, even though it is not certain that the NMD will succeed, the debate is in full swing.
And even if the system works, it will take between 10 and 15 years, perhaps more, until it is operational.
Also the words heat up about something which, if there is one day, will be - little impact.
Normally cautious Governments currently taking their brands as if the future was waiting for them at the corner of the wood.
How to explain this strange behavior?
Certainly not by blind faith in technology.
After all, the history of missile defense is full of examples of technology disappointments for his supporters, regardless of whether or not they are part of the Government.
No sane person cannot assume that what it has never managed before, IE - - destroying a small number of warheads in flight, will come true in one night.
Three tests that have been conducted so far, one missed in part, the other two totally, this is the reason why President Clinton chose to bequeath the problem to his successor.
If President Bush, as he has mentioned, now works for a new formula, it will take even more time to develop architecture and design a test program.
And it is impossible to be sure that it will work.
Governments are concerned at the present time, not because of what will be possible or not, but about the real or perceived American intentions.
Although Americans say loud and clear that the NMD is not directed against anyone, that the sole purpose of the States - United is to protect their citizens against States like the Iraq or North Korea, almost everyone is convinced of the contrary: the Russians fear that the Americans want to cement their military superiority (and the inferiority of the Russia) forever; the Chinese fear that the NMD is a sign of the American desire that Taiwan remains independent, the Europeans fear that America plans create tensions with the Russia and separates the States - United Europe.
Because what is important, what are the political intentions and technical capabilities, it is now the NMD creates problems: it grows the Russia confrontation, makes China nervous and strengthens a European sense of disunity with the States - United.
The damage began as early as the starting line while the trip remains uncertain.
The political consequences are further strengthened by the fact that, thirty years ago, the - United States and Soviet Union renounced effective defense against strategic nuclear missiles.
Normally, a defence project American still in embryo, should not cause as much excitement as the NMD.
But the ABM Treaty of 1972 prohibits, for an unlimited period, the systems designed to protect one or the other of these two countries against nuclear attacks.
Having regard to the way in which the States - United proceed with the NMD, they must either violate the Treaty or give six months notice to denounce him, that the two signatories are entitled to do so if they feel that it is in their vital security.
In the eyes of many, it would mean that America chooses to abandon the nuclear arms control structure built during the latter part of the cold war.
The Bush Administration contends that, because the cold war is over, the formal demise of the ABM Treaty would not endanger nuclear stability.
But stability is as much a problem of perception than policy technical calculations.
By limiting strategic missile defense, the old Treaty offers some assurance of deterrent for States possessing nuclear weapons.
Its disappearance would affect all other agreements on controls of weapons.
The Russia threatens all RIP if States - United leave the ABM Treaty.
Even if this threat lacks credibility (that would be first harmful to Russian interests), it is based on some logic.
The main question posed by the NMD is not how to prepare for a world of missile defence but how to deal with current political concerns.
Some attempts are being made discreetly in the background.
Legal experts from Washington suggest that preparations moderate for the construction of missile and radar sites do not violate the ABM Treaty and therefore do not force States - United to denounce.
For now, the Bush Administration will await the results of tests before making a decision.
Moscow and Washington suggest both a deep reduction of their offensive nuclear arsenal is possible.
The assurance that States - United will make participate in deliberations makes Allied skeptics more lenient European.
The most important measures designed to earn the trust, a modification of the ABM Treaty to allow limited missile defense is being be investigated.
The prior 'niet' of the Russia won't be definitive.
Thus the political turmoil in which the Russia and Europe are trained will settle down may be.
But China?
She, she, is not part of an alliance (such as Europe) or a network of weapons through political solutions which control treaty can be found (such as Russia), and this is a factor that contributes to the instability of the Asian and Chinese nervousness.
There, trust can be built only on a rapprochement between China and the States - United.
Alas, no indication that Washington had become aware of the seriousness of the problem.
Old cold war strategists are very disappointed with everything.
While they edit the vocabulary and abbreviations from the Royal era of deterrence, they discover that it is a lost world.
Missile defence does not threaten strategic stability between the - United States and the Russia but if it is poorly presented, it endangers the long-term political vision.
In announcing his determination to carry out a distant NMD, States - United have created a political storm which they must deal now if we want to avoid the greatest damage.
To avoid a lost generation.
Everywhere, the young unemployed to drift are a source of concern.
They are especially a problem in developing countries experiencing a population explosion more strong, the equivalent of the 'baby boom' in the West at the end of the second world war.
But the period that followed the war in most developed countries has been an era of unprecedented prosperity for the generation of baby boomers now approaching retirement.
The future it is going to be as promising for the billion and some of young people aged 12 to 24 years of developing countries?
These countries should urgently combine investment and policy measures to encourage youth to form, find work, stay healthy, start a family, and exercise their citizenship.
The benefit is considerable if they succeed: a development accelerated thanks to the contribution of a young population and the decrease in dependency ratio.
In East Asia, this 'demographic dividend' would be responsible for more than one-quarter of the region's economic growth.
Developing countries already have much invested in relation to young people.
They are now better educated and in better health than previous generations.
More than 80 per cent of children attend primary school, compared to 50% in 1970 and infant mortality has decreased by more than 10% to 6.5% during the same period.
But Governments should not settle for investing in children, they must also begin to deal with the new generation of young people.
Yet, in countries where the vast majority of children complete primary education, few of them have access to secondary school.
Young people account for half of the new cases of HIV infection.
In the Middle East and North Africa, a quarter of young people are without work.
All of this raises difficult questions: what is that hampers access to secondary education?
What is illiteracy which remains sometimes high, even at the end of the primary, or the lack of means?
Why is there not more young people who know how to protect themselves against AIDS?
Why companies in those countries are complaining - they often a lack of skilled workforce while so many students find themselves unemployed at the exit of the University?
An effective policy in the direction of youth is based on three types of measures: more success opportunities for young people, more skills and offer a second chance.
Governments must offer more possibility of success youth by improving access and quality care and education.
It was only in secondary education students take full advantage of primary education.
Yet, many young people are still ill-prepared high school and places are rare.
Employers today want highly skilled workers.
In countries as various as the Algeria, Bangladesh, the Brazil, China, the Estonia or Zambia, inadequate qualifications and training are hardly passable obstacles.
If we want to avoid that young people are stuck in jobs with no prospect of promotion or are simply unemployed, they should have better education and training that meets the needs of businesses.
Several countries are now trying to facilitate access to secondary education, including through conditional transfers programs ' which allow to distribute grants to poor families whose children regularly attend school.
These programs have helped increase the number of students in secondary education to the Mexico, Ecuador, Bangladesh and Cambodia.
But these programs have a utility, require that students have the skills required to enter secondary school.
In Morocco, for example, more than 80% of children complete a undergraduate education, but less than 20% reach the required level.
Measures are also needed to help young people make good decisions.
A Government cannot replace parents or the community, but it can make young people and their families to take care.
With the necessary information and adequate stimulation, young people will be better armed to make decisions about their health or their future.
In Cameroon, youth towns, a program on sexual hygiene, Horizon youth, helped increase their knowledge on the subject and to change their behaviour. Thus, the rate for young women reporting use of condoms increased from 58% to 76% in the group who have completed the program.
Another example: in Dominican Republic, enrolment in secondary schools has increased when middle school students have been informed of the amount of the salaries of those who had arrived at the end of their secondary education, an amount they had widely under - estimated.
In Bangladesh, the female secondary school assistance project financially assisted young girls aged 11 to 14 years to continue their studies and to delay marriage.
Governments must also offer a second chance' for young people who have failed due to the circumstances or poor choices.
The corresponding programmes must be well designed, properly targeted and coordinated so as to provide an incentive to its beneficiaries.
Thus, in Africa sub - Saharan, thousands of young combatants â 100,000 alone in Sudan - hope to rebuild their lives in peacetime, but they obviously need training and employment, as well as medical care and psychological support.
With political will, measures based on the efforts of young them - same to increase their chances of success and their skills, and the offer of a second chance to those who need it, these countries could make the most of their demographic advantage.
They can either take this opportunity for growth to improve their development prospects, or take the risk of a generation lost, embittered by the lack of future.
Finish with European paternalism.
The Italian Presidency of the European Union bears a huge responsibility to reinvigorate the enlargement as an essential aspect of the new EU.
The best place to start would be to encourage a better attitude towards adoption of the euro for the countries acceding to the Union.
In fact, the paternalistic position of the institutions of the EU to the accession countries threatens to create a two-speed Europe that will complicate the process of integration.
The accession countries have kept their market share in realizing trade integration with the EU countries sometimes further than in many Member countries.
Three of them - the Estonia, the Latvia and Lithuania - have a currency board system or fixed exchange rate with the euro, just like Bulgaria, who must join the Union in 2007.
Others showed several years their interest to adopt the euro from the start, in a unilateral way in some cases, even before they arrive in the Union - a position openly advocated by the National Bank of Poland, and to a lesser extent by the National Bank of Hungary and the National Bank of the Czech Republic.
Yet, despite their progress to bring their inflation rates and interest rates closer to European levels, many candidate countries fear, with full opening on the movement of capital, prerequisites for accession to the Union, exposing themselves to the risk of judgments brutal movements of capital and crisis currency.
They understood the lessons from Latin America and Asia in the 1990s.
The adoption of the euro would allow them easily to escape such risks and concentrate their efforts on the creation of a real growth for their economies.
However, the response of the European institutions and particularly the European Central Bank and the European Commission was negative: candidate countries agreed retort that they must first spend two years in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM II), where euro aspirants had to prove what were able to their policies.
Initially, even the currency board systems were considered unacceptable, although, as is often the case in Europe, exceptions have been made: countries with currency board systems could keep them even after their accession to the Union.
The opposition of the ECB and the Commission to an early adoption of the euro is ill-founded.
What should count for the European Union remains that any Member State policies are not harmful to the other Member States.
As noted by Leszek Balcerowicz, the Governor of the National Bank of Poland, the adoption of the euro by candidate countries creates certainly benefits for the candidate countries while, in the worst cases, entirely without effect for existing members.
Indeed, the economic combined weight of all the candidate countries is far too low - only 6% of the GDP of the EU expanded - to exercise an effect on the euro.
However, the continuing opposition of the EU institutions has pushed most of the candidate countries to abandon the idea of adopting the euro unilaterally or as soon as possible after their entry into the Union.
Unfortunately, the stubbornness of the ECB and the Commission now bring water to the mill of populist governments in the accession countries who rely on the variation of the rate of Exchange to escape the fiscal discipline that involves the adoption of the euro.
However, such tax manoeuvres would probably disqualify a country wishing to quickly enter the eurozone.
In fact, the accession countries which have not set up a currency board system have seen their budget deficits ignite - exceeding 9% of GDP in Hungary in 2002 and more than 5% in Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia - while major capital movements have exerted strong pressure on their currencies so they rise.
This trend exposes the real economies of the candidate countries at risk of reversal of the flow of capital and crisis currency that early adoption of the euro would eliminate.
Ironically, the candidate countries are lecturing by the officials of the ECB and the Commission on the trade-off between nominal convergence and real convergence.
It appears that the only requirement of Brussels or the objective of growth of the candidate countries, macroeconomic stability can wait.
Large budget deficits support growth, and inflation is clearly not a problem.
If this reasoning sounds familiar, it may well be because it takes more or less the foundations of the unsustainable planning system by which the accession of candidate countries was interrupted in the early 1990s.
This was, of course, the adoption of economic policies on the market forces in the former Communist countries which led to the gates of EU membership.
Thus, the institutions European should drop their paternalistic approach and take seriously the concerns of the central banks of the candidate countries about the risks associated with maintaining their own currency over a long period during which their economies must open up completely to capital movements.
Today, the ECB and the European Commission supported de facto the positions of populist governments of Eastern Europe that already spend funds that they hope to obtain in the future on the part of the EU.
It is high time that the European institutions address more responsibly to the challenges and opportunities posed by enlargement.
They could start by considering early adoption of the euro by the applicant countries of a more favourable eye, both for the countries with a currency board system for those using a floating exchange rate.
The European disaster of Blair.
When french and Dutch voters rejected the proposed Constitution of the European Union, everyone quickly understood that the European project was in a difficult situation.
The painful battle last week for the future medium term of the Union budget has further confirmed the verdict.
It also sadly put an end to the British Presidency of the European Council, recalling that the Grande - Bretagne continues to maintain its old reputation as an exception in the European Union.
The two facts are closely linked.
In France and the country - down, voters have not explained why they voted against the draft Constitution.
However, many commentators believed that this vote expressed their protest against as hasty felt admission of the 10 new Member States, and especially of the poorer countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
Specifically, it would appear that voters were afraid of losing their jobs, at the expense of crowds of migrants from the East. This fear was largely shown in this period, by the image of the cheap Polish plumber.
The irony, of course, lies in the fact that most of the fifteen old Member States refused to new incoming countries full and immediate access to Western markets on employment.
Whatever it is, it was too late to protest since the ten Eastern countries had indeed become members of the Union.
But now, all 25 Member States must face the consequences economic enlargement, not only on the question of the overall size of the EU budget for the next seven years, but also on the distribution of the troop/police contributors and beneficiaries.
The essential question is to know to what extent the old Member States are willing to pay to improve the economies lagging behind in the new Member States.
In fact, the battle took place on three fronts and has opposed the Grande - Bretagne, the France and the new Member States.
Traditionally, a large majority of the budget returned to agriculture and regions whose development is lagging behind.
In practice, huge sums of money were allocated to big agricultural producers either to the poorest countries as the Greece and the Portugal.
At these two levels, the new Member States expected to benefit substantially from the EU system.
In budgetary terms, the big loser European mechanisms was once the Kingdom - United. At the time where two-thirds of European expenditure returned to agriculture, its agricultural sector was weak, as a result, the British have little benefited from European agricultural subsidies.
For a long time, they complained of the injustice of these rules, especially that in this period, the Kingdom - Uni was one of the poorest countries. It was in 1984 that the Conservative Government of Margaret Thatcher demanded and got a massive discount on the British net contribution to the EU budget.
Today, the situation has changed in three essential points. First, the reform of European agricultural policy has started and the proportion of the European agricultural budget has dropped by 60 to 40%.
After, that makes for many years that the most - Brittany enjoys rapid economic growth more than most of the other Member States if though it became one of the richest countries of the EU, even compared with the France and the Germany. Finally, the new Member States are so much poorer than the poorest in the old Member States that they have a moral argument of weight to apply a generous portion of the budget negotiated, whatever it is.
The beginning of the negotiations, six months ago, coincides with the start of the British Presidency of the European Council.
Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, has galvanized European politicians by declaring the Parliament in Brussels that he was "passionately pro - European".
That was the message that the British pro - Europeans had hoped for a long time and that they waited vainly since the election of Blair in 1997.
Of course, he has never expressed such a feeling to breast - even the Great - Britain, over the past eight years.
In addition, since the Great - Britain has been one of the most ardent defenders of enlargement to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, one might have to expect that, during the budget negotiations, Blair's Government is proportionately as generous and enthusiastic towards new entrants.
Initially, it seemed to be the tactic chosen by the British Government.
But against all odds, it adopted an ethically advantageous position by offering to waive a portion of its budget rebate, on the sole condition that the rest of the European Union (and France in particular) agree on the fundamental reforms in European agricultural policy.
It took time for the British understand that President Jacques Chirac was a wobbly Chair and beleaguered remaining at the Elysee until 2007, but without any power, he had no means to endorse such bargaining.
Once the British have become aware of this reality, they played their last dismal card in the management of the negotiations. They made offers petty and ridiculous, all primarily developed to safeguard the small interests British and, mainly, at the expense of the new Member States.
What sad conclusion for a Presidency opened with fanfare six months ago by statements passionately pro - European of Tony Blair!
The full text of his speech is unambiguous.
Blair is in favour of Europe, but not to the - ci.
He wants to be part of a political Europe, but only if other Member States agree to follow the model of economic and social reform British.
The problem is that economic and social reform is purely and simply a matter of national policy and is not part of the competences of the Union. If such a reform were to take place in France or Germany, this issue would be discussed exclusively between politicians and voters french or German.
She could enroll in the competences of the Union only if the EU becomes a true federation.
Can anyone tell Blair that it is federalist, then?
Of course not!
It is especially a unthinking nationalist who lives in fear of the sneaky tabloid press in his country.
So, why he therefore said his pro - European fervour?
May - be has t - he finally not given thought to the question.
Europe the challenge of neoliberalism.
For more than twenty years, I have argued that high rates of unemployment in Western Europe could not persist.
At the end of the 1970s, monetarists had bet that only a modest and transient unemployment increase could contain inflation rampant - and open - from the industrial West, and with the decline in the cost of the return to the effective price stability in would have been worthwhile.
In Great - Britain and the States - United, this monetarist bet had a happy ending.
Not in Western Europe.
Over the past 25 years, European unemployment has increased as monetary policy is tended and interest rates were raised to fight inflation.
But when inflation succumbed, unemployment has not been reduced, or no.
If the unemployment rate has still not reached the levels of the great depression, he remained high enough to make the unemployment in the long term, or the fear of long-term unemployment, a shocking experience.
The companies in which the official unemployment rate remains at 10% or several generations more Governments economic mismanagement.
Accordingly, it has seemed to me for 20 years that balance underlying - policy in Western Europe, - collective bargaining and generous social insurance, on the one hand, and monetary policy tightened on the other, was condemned to crack.
European decision-makers seem paralyzed by a double fear.
Central bankers of Europe fear that their political masters order them to relax their monetary policy, that the structural reforms needed to release aggregate supply are not granted, and result in a return to the inflation of the 1970s.
In short, they fear that all the sacrifices undertaken to stabilize prices have been in vain.
Politicians in Western Europe, for their part, fear the opposite effect.
They worry about the idea that even after having undertaken structural reforms to reduce the appeal of insurance - unemployment and to motivate workers so that they go to companies and businesses to workers, central bankers continue to insist to tighten the purse strings.
In short, they fear that without increased production or employment, the net effect is that an increase in poverty.
Naturally, these fears are accompanied by the hope that structural reforms and monetary expansion are working in harmony, causing an expansion of employment and production without causing a consequent increase in inflation.
But the reality is that no move towards the relaxation of monetary policy was made in place, especially with the European Central Bank beginner, anxious to establish its credibility in the fight against inflation - and that attempts at structural reforms are hesitant, reduced and companies without enthusiasm.
I misled for 20 years: regimes in Western Europe remained stable despite the exclusion of a large proportion of citizens of real participation in economic life.
The growth of the economies of the countries of Western Europe has continued, despite the heavy burden of the 10% unemployed, but not as quickly as she could have it.
Today, it looks like I finally have reason, if not panic, at least to worry.
The French rejected the European constitution, first and foremost (at least according to appearances), because a greater European integration is concerned - on, would result in its wake the huge cost and disruption of neoliberalism.
It is one thing to support the 'European project' when it comes to link the Germany and the France so closely that no one deems useful to the war to determine what language must be spoken in Alsace - Lorraine.
It is another when the European project means that french workers will face competition from Polish plumbers, Romanian farmers and Turkish vendors.
In Germany, voters seem about to eject Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, as his tepid allegiance to the neo-liberal project their dislike.
The problem is that they might find themselves governed for four years by Angela Merkel, a Chancellor almost also attached to the neoliberal project as me.
I believe that the Germany would get better, in ten years, with more neo-liberal policies.
But this does not seem to correspond to the desire of the German electorate, which makes absolutely unpredictable aspect of German policy within four years.
It is also with the discontent of the Northern Europe to central bankers, particularly of the ECB and the euro.
Not that the European Monetary Union end be decided, but it's just that some have begun to consider a dark future where the end of EMU would be made to the program.
What is sufficient to shake asset everywhere prices worldwide.
The achievements of Western Europe since the second world war are amongst the most impressive and most encouraging success in the history of the world.
Everyone should wish that today's United Europe building on these successes, rather than see generations of high unemployment rate put them in danger.
For this, the attitude of the ECB will have to change.
Europe needs a monetary policy whereas the decline in the rate of unemployment in Northern Europe is more important than the stability of the price of the continent.
Southern and Eastern Europe will experience inflation, it is unavoidable, because as regions develop and industrialize, the terms of trade are improving, and under the aegis of a monetary union, regional inflation may constitute a step in.
The ECB should not try to balance inflation in the South and it is with the deflation of the North artificial targets across the entire continent.
Saved by taxes.
Of what are - we owe to our back - back - back small - child?
What steps must - take us today to reduce the risks posed to our descendants and our planet by the increasing probability of global warming and the changing climate?
Almost everyone - with the exception of Exxon Mobil, Vice - president Dick Cheney and their appointed servants their handled acolytes â understands that when human beings humans burn hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide escaping into the atmosphere, where it acts like a huge blanket that absorbs the infrared radiation emitted by - below, with result a warming of the planet.
Similarly, almost everyone understands that the warming of the planet could be more serious or less serious than existing models suggest, but that this uncertainty is not an excuse for doing nothing.
In fact, it should rather encourage us to better in guard if we knew that this warming will be exactly according to the average projections.
Finally, almost everyone agrees that Governments, for non - profit institutions and oil companies should spend much more money to research on technologies energy without emission of carbon dioxide, or able to remove the pollutants of the atmosphere and oceans and thus cool the planet by returning more solar radiation.
It is clear that it is the rich countries that must assume the burden of solving the problem of climate change over the next generations.
After all, them have access to industrialization and wealth by polluting cheerfully.
Today, China, the India and other developing countries do not have this freedom and it would be unfair to penalize them.
It is now time to build, not to dismantle or undermine, international institutions that will manage our response to climate change in the years to come.
But should - do us another thing now and over the next decade?
Economists like to think in terms of cost.
And when they see behavior that have destructive side effects, they like taxing it.
Taxation requires individuals to feel the damage they cause there where it hurts - at the door - currency.
Impose a tax on those who drive 4 x 4 in the city, for example, is a way to encourage collective intelligence to decide that the side effects are a good reason to modify its behavior.
But it must be a fair tax.
A 4 x 4 that runs 17 miles in the city and which consumes 3.7 litres of gasoline rejects nearly 3 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
The 'greenhouse effect' tax must - she be â¬0.010, â¬0.38 or â¬1.15 per litre?
This choice will be determined by what we learn over the years, but today, the amount of the tax depends on more than a philosophical question: how many believe - owe us our distant descendants?
The Australian economist John Quiggin has posted an informative discussion on its web site (.)
Other hand, this calculation critics point out that the world today is poor. Annual average GDP per capita in purchasing power parity, is located at â¬5500 approximately.
Expected to improve technologies and their diffusion makes the world richer in 2100: with an annual growth of 2 percent, it will reach almost â¬40,000 per head in terms of 2006 purchasing power.
These critics believe so we have much more need today in this marginal expenditure â¬55 richest 2100 individuals will need â¬400 that they would earn by being preserved from the effects of climate change.
But what critics often fail to mention is that the same logic applies to today's world.
The average annual income per capita are now at approximately â¬30.600 States - United, in the Japan and Western Europe and less than â¬4600 for the poorer half of the globe.
The same logic that we need more â¬55 today that the people of 2100 will need $ 400 additional wants that the wealthy should be taxed more, insofar as each â¬380 extra in taxes in rich countries translates into an increase of the per capita income of â¬55 in poor countries.
In other words, if the rich are stingy today toward our richer descendants, and if we decide to allow them to cope with an ecological disaster, we must now be generous with the poor of this world.
Conversely if we are stingy today toward the poor, we must be generous with our descendants.
This is at least what we should do if our actions are based on moral principles than on the leitmotiv of Leonid Brezhnev: "that we have taken, we keep it".
Take the pharmacovigilance seriously.
Health hazards â nuclear reactors, guns, and contaminated foods - threaten us all, that is why Governments play an active role to limit, through regulations often successful.
However, the situation is very different when it comes to the safety of prescription drugs.
In fact, for the regulator, pharmacovigilance is the poor relation of public protection.
Yet, the scope of the problem is huge.
Nothing that States - United, it is estimated that each year the side effects are responsible for the death of 100,000 patients.
If these numbers are true, it means that the deaths caused by drugs ranked fourth or fifth leading cause of death (estimated mortality used).
In addition, direct annual hospital costs attributable to adverse effects would amount in billions of dollars, and all this without the suffering caused by the side effects that do not lead to hospitalization (or death).
The difficulty in determining the causes and effects must be taken into account.
It is sometimes difficult to know if the death or hospitalization of a patient is due to a particular drug, the disease treated, or the association of the two.
This phenomenon only underlines the need to ensure the safety of the drugs.
The fact that all drugs, in addition to their benefits, produce side effects in some patients is one of the reasons for pharmacovigilance.
It is necessary to weigh carefully the beneficial and adverse drug effects before approving and use.
These judgments vary, depending on whether they are issued by a pharmaceutical company, which expects its sales benefits, or a patient who may suffer from a serious side effect.
The incomplete knowledge complicates this estimate.
The rush to put new drugs on the market often leads to an incomplete search on their safety.
More than half of the approved drugs causes a serious side effect unknown at the time of its authorisation to place on the market.
An example: when the new class of painkillers called inhibitors Cox - 2 has been placed on the market, regulators, doctors and patients were unaware that these medicines could cause heart attacks and a stroke.
Tens of thousands of innocent patients, perhaps more, have suffered these side effects before the withdrawal of the first two drugs in this class.
It is difficult to provide a comprehensive and appropriate from the harmful effects of drugs list.
The rate of spontaneous reports to regulatory agencies is low, about 1%, and the controls are passive in many countries.
It also takes on the repugnance of General to report adverse effects of medicines.
Doctors feel sometimes guilty and fear the trials, and pharmaceutical companies are concerned about threats to their profits. Regulations regarding these agencies must face the question "why this medicine it was OK?".
It is particularly difficult to attribute an adverse reaction to a drug when the symptom is common in the age of the user group or the disease treated.
As the risk of heart attack is important for the elderly, many suffer from pain related to arthritis requiring analgesic treatment, it took six years to make the link between Cox - 2 inhibitors and multiplication by two or three risk of heart attacks.
A recent survey Harris Survey in the States - United finds that 60% of adults are either convinced steps at all, either not very convinced drug manufacturers to disclose in respect their information on the adverse effects of their products.
This skepticism is justified: internal documents obtained during recent trials reveal that pharmaceutical companies often fail to submit critical information in terms of safety to the regulatory agencies, as requested by the law, and fail to communicate this information to physicians and patients.
One of the problems is that the consequences of this neglect of the harmful effects of drugs are non-existent or minimal.
It is time to be serious.
Â· Citizens and Governments must make the pharmacovigilance a priority and commit resources to address the problem.
Â· The penalties applicable to pharmaceutical companies who fail to report and provide information on their drug safety must be increased substantially for an effective deterrent.
Â· The control agencies must have the means to enforce laws so that stricter rules are implemented.
Â· The problem of pharmacovigilance should be regarded as a failure of the system.
It is not fair to blame the serious side effects to physicians, particularly in the absence of comprehensive information on the safety of the drugs.
The full cooperation of physicians is essential to address the problem, but this means put an end to their fear of ending up in court.
This approach works well in the aviation industry: pilots who reported the errors that they have failed to commit are not penalized.
Â· Patients should be better informed about the risks of drugs that they are prescription and more involved in their detection and their reporting.
Notices printed in small letters are unnecessary.
Â· Control of adverse effects must be more proactive.
This calls for more funding, which should come from the main beneficiaries of the sale of the drugs: the pharmaceutical industry, the same title that the monitoring of aviation safety is funded by airlines.
Above - all, improving pharmacovigilance will depend, if we want that the efforts will lead, the establishment of an independent office designed to promote, coordinate and provide guidance to the regulatory program.
This office exists in the Kingdom - Uni.
Other Governments should follow this model in order to fulfil their role, neglected so far, guardian of public health.
The virtual enemy.
Five years have passed since the terrorist attacks of September 2001 on New York and Washington, and yet it seems that policymakers learned very little on the mode of operation of terrorist cells and their weaknesses.
The Bush administration still uses the phrase "war on terror" and behaves as if it were really one war of usual type where a Government fight another.
However, after five years of military efforts, strategies based on the targeting of a single opponent did only aggravate the situation.
It is time to understand the new model of conflict emerging.
The "war" paradigm to work, the Bush administration refers to al - Qaida as to a specific enemy.
In reality, there are no great organizer and financier of terrorist activities.
The attacks of Madrid, Bali and London, as well as several attempts thwarted States - United and Grande - Bretagne, were all characterized by their dispersed organization.
It is independently generated plots that have used ad hoc, often inside the target country resources.
These small operations also lacked a common internal schema.
Terrorist motivations differ from cell to cell, even from person to person.
Individuals may be motivated by profit or the thirst of power, or for political and religious reasons while others acting out of hatred or the great thrill.
In addition, there are large differences in terms of risks, rewards and imperatives that are climbing the chain organizational or we pass from one cell to another.
Conventional military models are equipped to decapitate something which, in this case, has no head.
The characteristics of this new structure have already been studied in a very different context.
Terrorism is the violent version of an "agile virtual enterprise".
A virtual enterprise is a small group that assembles itself into organization just large enough to implement a collective intention.
Virtual enterprises are unusually innovative, and in the business sector, they are probably the only system capable of effectively developing a unique product.
A glaring example is the film production industry.
In fact, it is no doubt the business model of the future.
The benefits of virtual enterprises come from their lightness in terms of stability.
At present, most of the price of a product finance the huge and inefficient organization that has assembled it.
Almost all of the creativity and the resolution of problems happen in small firms and are "integrated" later by large companies, whose infrastructure is expensive and fragile, and retains most of the profits.
This model is the basis of business today, just as centralization has been the preferred defense strategy.
When you buy a car at General Motors, 80 cents of each dollar return to GM, which is practically managed only one.
Small suppliers actually provide 80% of the value and innovation, but receive only 20% of the reward.
Ironically, extensive research on alternative models have been funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, which, as the largest purchaser of complicated machinery in the world, wanted better quality goods, cheaper and customized more.
This research discovered the conditions and the mechanisms needed to facilitate autonomous small opportunistic groups and allow them to behave like large companies.
Unfortunately, the research program was cancelled before his findings can be applied to the business world, surely because it threatened large companies.
We often forget that US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has abandoned a comfortable retreat to reorganize the U.S. military into a smaller, more agile force, using some of these same ideas.
But the Organization of the Iraq invasion, for which Rumsfeld had advocated less soldiers than expected, shows a poor understanding of distributed systems.
Then the troops were deployed to an entry and a flexible withdrawal, the Bush administration eventually use them for the former occupation.
Terrorists have shown a great talent to capitalize on the models of distributed operations.
Crowds of texts appear in the Muslim world on strategic studies of jihad.
The best known in the West is The Management of Savagery [management of brutality], but only because he has translated and made public.
These books (and the trends they indicate) become less dogmatic and more complex in terms of adoption of modern management techniques.
Their research surely includes the young science of virtual enterprise management: how to nurture and support cells auto - organized.
The first lesson for Western policymakers is perhaps that virtual enterprises rely on a culture of trust.
Certain types of trust can be based on an artificial notion of "not us" rather than on real values and direct experience.
For this reason, that the actions of the Bush administration do strengthen the dynamics of the terrorist virtual enterprise.
Bush "them and us" rhetoric clearly defines an "other" and positions it as a cohesive enemy.
His 'war' approach helps Islamic terrorists to the West as a force just as United and malevolent.
In the future, the virtual enterprise model will shape the manner in which will be conducted the Affairs, which will be delivered wars and probably how government services will be administered.
He promises to separate the management of the finances of the production, involving innovations and faster economic growth.
However, if Western governments do not develop a deep understanding of how to operate these structures, they have no chance to fight the agile terrorist enterprise.
The Expansion as a solidarity.
Nowadays, it is often said that the sense of solidarity of the European Union has been endangered, not to say completely that it totally exploded, by enlargement to the countries of Central Europe and the East.
The Bulgaria and Romania closer to turn of entry into the EU, and the negotiations which should open with the Turkey and Croatia, it has become essential to question this idea.
The values and interests of new members of the European Union more often coincide with those of the first 15 members.
It is true, of course, enlargement has fundamentally changed the Union and given rise to new problems and political issues.
However, the new Member States of Central Europe and East are deeply integrated into the economic, social and cultural development of our continent.
The ties that unite us have eroded by 40 years of Soviet domination, but this has not changed basically the European character of these States.
My country, the Poland, has always had deep cultural links with other European countries, particularly the France.
We have participated in all the major European developments in music, literature and cinema (with, for example, the films of Andrzej Wajda's era solidarity, such as "Danton", a co - French production).
Sport also, the Eastern Europeans are integrated for a long time to the rest of Europe.
Indeed, before the first world war, the German national football team was composed entirely of players with Polish surnames.
But, above all, there is a deep sense among the Poles, Hungarians and Czechs, as well as others, who feel all Europeans.
What is the true meaning of the word 'solidarity' as defined by the dictionary Le Petit Robert: 'relationship between people with consciousness of a community of interest'.
Solidarity as meaning of a unit resulting from common interests is also clear in the 15 original members as members of the enlarged Union of today.
Exceptions prove the rule.
The lack of unity within the European Union on the Iraqi question must not be shading to the agreements that Member States concluded on all the other important issues in international affairs.
On economic issues, disagreements on a unique regulation in the European Union, for example, should not obscure the fact that no Member State, new or historic, never challenged the Community market.
Finally, the enlargement process itself - even clearly is a symbol of European unity social, civil and cultural.
The fact that this provoked debate and discussion does not contradict the belief shared by all, old and new Member States, they have obligation to rebuild a continent after decades of division.
Remain a few issues which, if they are not source of fundamental division, are disturbing.
Should - fear us the fact that Europe is today a continent purely judeo - Christian and white?
Citizens of the European Union whose origins are in other continents and whose religion is Hindu, Islamic, sikh or Buddhist may - they identify with "European" values and culture?
Will be - they able to feel European as always have the poles or the Czechs?
These issues are especially valid, in fact they cannot be avoided in the case of the possible accession of the Turkey to the European Union.
European integration is - it animated by respect for the values of others?
Is - to share or contribute?
These are thorny questions.
They are particularly difficult if we consider culture as the cement of the future of Europe.
All European countries probably thought from the beginning that newcomers non-European would be treated in the same way that the Polish immigrants were assimilated into the German Ruhr to the ten a le dix-neuvieme siecle - ninth century.
The fact that it does this is not produced, at least on a large scale, does not mean that this cannot occur.
There is only to see the number of respectable citizens of Turkish origin living in Germany.
Or the large number of British Indian and Pakistani second generation can be seen now in suit tie with notebook in hand, always between two aircraft.
However, Europeans must admit that these individuals represent only a minority.
Number of groups of immigrants in Europe are them - same rejected by their communities because of the social and economic integration impossible.
The constant threat of terrorism has made the isolation of the Islamic peoples of Europe even more dramatic.
The European Union cannot simply declare 'solidarity' as a core value and do nothing to encourage those who feel marginalized.
They should be allowed, too, to feel this "relationship between people with consciousness of a community of interest".
European solidarity cannot survive this negligence and did not survive.
After Kyoto.
The Treaty of the Kyoto Protocol is now entered into force for the 126 nations who signed to date.
It is now time to start wondering about the following point: how to bring all the nations, including the large emitters to discuss actions to be taken after the expiry of the Treaty in 2012?
This is exactly what has the European Commission done recently by unveiling its first strategy for an era post - Kyoto, which will be discussed by the European Council in March.
While the Kyoto Protocol represents only a modest reduction of carbon emissions in industrialized countries (5.2% between 2008 and 2012 compared to 1990 levels, with varying objectives depending on the country), real progress can be made in supporting development efforts and preserving our planet.
But first, all countries must integrate climate concerns into their policy planning and improve their governance in some key sectors such as energy, infrastructure and transport.
In other words, we must act with awareness that climate change and its effects on the people of rich and poor countries remain a threat to global security.
Ultimately, the approach in the long term will probably include a system based on rules, a system of incentives and investments at the level of technological change.
Adaptation at the national level will be increasingly recognized as a major issue that will require adequate funding.
The treatment of the effects of climate change and the treatment of emission reductions should not to exclude each other, but be complementary.
Consider the post - Kyoto World offers us the chance to begin a new dialogue and to consider new options on climate change.
The nations could set a more ambitious target that would limit the change over the long term of the temperature of the Earth, and then assign rights of emissions between the countries in such a way to ultimately limit temperature increases to an acceptable level.
This would require to increase investments in research and development on energy to develop technologies both new and better, a process that must be supported by stronger partnerships between the public and private sectors.
So far, with only 15% of the world population, rich countries are responsible for more than 75% of global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), and therefore most of the damage caused to the environment.
It is however developing countries (and therefore the poor countries of the world) who are the most vulnerable.
It is unrealistic to ask the poor countries, where more than 1.6 billion people have no access to energy and clean technology, the costs associated with the long-awaited technological change.
In collaboration with its partners, the World Bank supports financial strategies aimed at helping developing countries to adjust costs due to climate change.
To date, more than $ 1 billion invested in projects GEF (Global Environment Facility - the global environment facility) and about 8 billion dollars in co-financing, have engaged in programs related to climate change.
While the regulatory mechanisms of Kyoto and the European system of negotiable emission (European Trading Scheme) have contributed to the creation of an emerging market for carbon trade, interested parties are now concerned for the immediate future.
Without regulatory framework after 2012, opportunities for initiation of projects-based transactions will be completed by 2006 / 2007.
Given the long delay between the preparation of projects and the first benefits of reductions in emissions, project developers have only a few years before them to act before carbon payments cease to make a significant contribution to the financing of projects in the current context.
The development of infrastructure-related projects is a long process that requires between 3 and 7 years of identification through licensing, financing and construction, until the first certification of reductions in carbon emissions.
Projects must be operational at the latest by 2007.
The World Bank contributed to advance the financing of carbon as a tool for sustainable development and to facilitate the participation of the private sector in the market.
The Bank is focused on the representation of the interests of its borrowing countries, helping them to develop assets for carbon trading on the basis of their own priorities.
But without commitment by Governments to limit the gas emissions to greenhouse to the - beyond 2012, the carbon market will remain uncertain and the private sector (essential to the success of the market) should not extend its participation in a significant and sustainable way.
According to a recent study supported by the World Bank on the companies interested in carbon finance, only a company out of five surveyed said that it was interested in emissions reductions after 2012.
The opportunity now to look to the future and mobilize the world community (all countries without exception, although with different responsibilities) in the quest for a safer world, a world that would avoid the terrible risks of environmental degradation and social conflict involved by inaction.
State of the art or art of the State?
September is traditionally the month where the orchestras and Opera companies leave Aix, Salzburg, Tanglewood Festival, and many others to return home.
This autumn is also marked (on both sides of the Atlantic) by the return of concerns about funding of classical music.
American symphonic life is Eurocentric in almost all its aspects, except for its funding.
While Americans rely on private donations deductible taxes and revenues to fund classical music performances, Europeans prefer direct government support.
Ironically, while defenders of the arts in the States - United call since a long time the adoption of the 'European model', which produced a rich artistic life and varied, Europe is forced to change course and direct its support system towards a more dependence vis - Ã  - vis private money and revenues.
Unfortunately, the European system of government funding direct is victim of slow European economic growth and budget deficits.
The problem arises especially for countries that have adopted the euro, since public expenditure in the arts sector will be limited for a while by the obligation to keep the deficit below the 3% of GDP.
The resulting pressure on the European institutions of the performing arts causes concern at several levels.
Traditionally, European social democracies prefer to divide the goods and rare services such as concerts and operas according to a system of queues (financed by huge subsidies to keep prices low) rather than by the willingness of each to pay.
This will change now.
Defenders of the arts of the show in Europe show the States finger - United where, among others, even of great conductors must participate actively looking for funding and play an active role in the local community on behalf of the Orchestra.
They fear that the same thing happened in Europe.
Some conductors, refusing to handle the plate at the same time as the wand, refused to important positions in the States - United for this reason, believing that this would upset their art..
It is said that Daniel Barenboim left the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in part because he opposed the fundraising requirements expected of him.
But the North - American experience shows that having recourse to great names of the field of art, as conductors, to participate in the fundraiser, is not necessarily detrimental to the artistic aspect of the business.
Michael Tilson Thomas in San Francisco, for example, has combined fundraising effective and artistic direction to propel the San Francisco Symphony at the top of the North orchestras - American.
Europeans, worried at the idea that greater dependence vis - Ã  - vis private money necessarily means conservative programming, should also be reassured by seeing that the San Francisco Symphony has one of the most daring State directories - United.
If the public has progressive, silver tastes private and innovative programming are entirely compatible.
The corollary is that public money makes possible an adventurous programming even if the taste of the public tends to be conservative.
It is one of the reasons why artists in Europe like public money; it releases them with a plan exclusive of Beethoven and Mozart.
In addition, the public can come to enjoy an adventurous directory to force that proposed it.
Naturally, if public funds are reduced for the arts of the show, not only those - ci must â they depend more on private money, but the prices will have to increase.
Some deplore it, and prefer the tail system to get tickets because they fear that higher rates would compromise the future public by excluding young people.
But low prices for the performing arts do not solve the thorny problem of access for young people.
First of all, young people can not take advantage of the inexpensive places simply because regardless of the price of classical music are not interested.
Then, even if they want to go there, it is sometimes impossible to get seats, which are often more available because subscriptions remain the same hands year after year.
What is the value of having low prices, which serve mainly to subsidize the same subscription holders, if there is no places?
If the taste for classical music needs to be subsidised, we must encourage subsidies better targeted rather than low prices.
The best way to attract youth to the performing arts is through education.
Given that the American orchestras can count on schools or the Government to provide the musical basic education necessary to ensure a constant audience to classical music, some orchestras are themselves with private money.
In San Francisco, for example, the Symphony runs a project called Keeping Score, financed with private funds in the amount of $ 23 million, which includes a national television series, radio shows, interactive learning of music and school music programs.
This type of innovative program applies equally to European and American orchestras.
The problem of youth and access to the performing arts exists on both sides of the Atlantic.
Just like the poor quality of musical education in public school.
If orchestras are not their own future, they may simply do not have.
Respect for the law, Russian.
All over the world, there is concern the disappearance of political freedom in Vladimir Putin's Russia.
The Russians themselves are virtually the only ones do not have to worry about this creeping authoritarianism.
They seem less concerned by political freedoms and social protection: pensions, domestic violence, children's rights, or police brutality.
In reality, most Russians are indifferent to the efforts made by the Government to restrict the freedom of the press and the right to protest.
This apathy makes my task as Ombudsman, an institution by the State Duma (Parliament) to protect political rights in Russia, difficult or even impossible.
The Ombudsman serves as a bridge between the authorities and the people; It strives to resolve the conflicts between the organs of the State to the citizens.
My office is open not only Russian citizens, but also foreign nationals and stateless persons who believe that their political rights were threatened.
We apply the Russian constitution, but also the principles of international law and human rights standards, sometimes even in contradiction with our constitution.
For example, as a mediator, I opposed to the restriction of the right of Russians to be jurors.
Those who wished to limit the use of juries supposedly feared for national security.
My office worked closely with the State to ensure that most trials are held with a jury.
Similarly, my office has defended the liberal weekly Novoe Vremya, subjected to pressure by the municipality of Moscow under the pretext of a commercial dispute concerning a lease.
The dispute is not resolved, but following my intervention the Moscow authorities are obliged to take into account negative attitude of the public face of their attempts to censor this journal.
Of course, the Russia provides examples of problems relating to political and fundamental freedoms more headlines, like the dirty war in Chechnya or the case of Yukos.
My office handles as much as possible of Chechnya, although this is not easy since Moscow.
I could spend all my time, but the Russia has 89 regions and countless to solve human rights problems.
This is why I suggested to Putin that Chechnya has its own regional mediator, on-site permanently.
The new Chechen authorities seem to rejoice.
With regard to case Yukos, my office cannot intervene in any ongoing legal proceedings.
Counsel for the former CEO of Yukos, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, filed a complaint before the European Court of human rights in Strasbourg.
If Khodorkovsky disagrees with the final decision of the Russian courts, there will be no doubt appeal before this Court.
This is at that time - that I can give my opinion.
Many observers stress however that the subjects of a criminal investigation should be released on bail and not imprisoned.
For others, it is not possible in the case of Khodorkovsky: he is very rich and could therefore easily evading justice and flee abroad.
It is precisely what did other figures accused in the Yukos affair.
All these serious problems in the field of human rights highlight the incompleteness of the Russian legal institutions.
For example, the Duma took much too long to adopt legislation on pressure groups, which in most developed democracies clearly defines the acceptable and unacceptable behaviors.
Khodorkovsky reportedly may not be so many troubles if such laws existed.
However the absence of legislation is directly related to the absence of clear ideas.
Russia human rights are often violated simply because people do not know they have these rights.
The most important objective for my office is that everyone learn how to better defend its rights and that the authorities take into account the complaints of ordinary Russian citizens.
Unfortunately, most bureaucrats still despise the values of human rights.
But the real challenge for my office is neither ignorance nor legal gaps: it is the fact that in a legal system insufficiently developed as that of Russia, my authority is essentially personal, and requires the support of the media.
Notions of human being even rudimentary rights, we can at best hope an awareness Jack which spread little by little.
My strategic objective is therefore to raise awareness of the Ombudsman's office, in order to get more respect and recognition on the part of citizens and the State.
It is virtually impossible without cooperation with non-governmental organizations for the defence of the rights of man in Russia.
Moreover, I consider that one of my tasks is to encourage contacts between these groups and the authorities.
The response of the Government to these initiatives will better know whether and to what extent the Putin Government intends to include political and human rights in the context of his "dictatorship of law".
The revolutionary conservative Pope.
Twenty-five years ago, the Polish people amazed that one of them, cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Krakow, has been appointed to access to the papacy.
Some are frightened, others shed tears of joy.
Behold, as wrote a famous writer, "the second baptism of the Poland".
But even in our euphoria, we did not expect that the new Pope will change as not only the Poland, but around the world.
His first visit to his native country soon after his induction has shown to the world the power of the new Pope.
The Communist police disappeared from the main streets of Warsaw, the streets have become models of order.
After decades of deprivation of their autonomy, the Poles suddenly regained their capacity for self-determination.
Saying aloud qu ' "it may not be Europe without an independent Poland on its map", the Pope has managed to sweep the unjust settlement after - war that had subject the Poland to Soviet power.
Then to Auschwitz, the Pope said: "I speak on behalf of all those whose rights are ignored and violated in the world, I speak because I am bound, we are all bound, by the truth".
This place, in this Golgotha of modern times, he called the Poles who remembered their families gassed in the crematorium of Auschwitz as well as those frozen in concentration camps in Siberia, a fraternity dedicated to the fight against hatred and vengeance, even justified.
Some consider the Pope as the man that caused a religious revival; Others hold to a man of peace.
Some see in him one defender of the poor, others a critic of liberation theology.
For the people of Poland, Jean - Paul II, by making human rights the central point of his teaching, will be forever the man who gave us courage and hope, which restored our historical identity.
Indeed, during the first decade of his reign, the Pope devoted his efforts to the fight against the dictatorship, and especially the Communist dictatorship.
The strategy formulated by the Pope for the Catholic Church and its ability to mobilize millions of believers to his cause meant that nobody can never reiterate the question posed by Stalin: "How many divisions the Pope there?".
Jean - Paul II demonstrated that moral force was a weapon powerful enough to defeat the division of the world established in Yalta.
May - be partly into question their strongly anti-Communist position, the Catholic Church and Jean - Paul II often receive the label "conservative".
This accusation suggests that the Church can not coexist easily with a pluralist democracy.
It is certain that in the fight against communism, the Polish church has rather been conservative, thank God!
It proved conservative in its absolute fidelity to the Gospel values, to the truth of the faith, to its historical identity.
For a system that advocated official atheism and legalized lying, the Church represented a living reproach.
However, with the disappearance of communism, the problem encountered by Jean - Paul II and his church at present is as follows: in what language can Evangelical values - they be expressed in a world in which evil is not embodied by a political system, but is present in each soul?
What is the message of the Pope for the postcommunist world he helped create?
Jean - Paul II undoubtedly keeps his distance from liberal economic ideas and the liberal State, what it often taxes permissiveness and moral relativism.
The statements of the Pope are frequently marred a critique of individualism on behalf of collective values.
He considers the shortcomings of liberalism as being particularly pernicious in postcommunist countries.
The market economy, despite its practical achievements, seems often to his eyes, Miss a heart and a human face.
It considers that the market promotes the spirit of enterprise at the expense of human solidarity.
John Paul II is passionate so not for modern Western civilization, with its separation from the world values, and he opposed it to the moral sensitivity of corporations just outputs from several decades of dictatorship.
Just like Alexandre Soljenitsyne, the Pope tends to believe that it is above all in resistance to totalitarianism that man can become truly free and preserve the fundamental values of civilization.
I confess that I consider the legacy of communism with more skepticism.
Totalitarian pressure has created exceptional men like Jean - Paul II and Alexandre Soljenitsyne, people who believe that religious faith bought freedom from lies and loneliness.
But it has also created men such as Andrei Sakharov and Vaclav Havel, who defended their supreme values referring to a secular humanism and speaking on his behalf.
However, for most people, life under a totalitarian dictatorship had certainly nothing of ennobling; rather, it was a daily immersion in lies, spiritual depravity, and hardware corruption.
This is the reason why Postcommunist societies do not constitute evidence no nobility or no relief that decide deeply with the West.
The defeat of communism has left a big black hole in the souls of communities, a hole that is now filled by ideas of nationalism, intolerance and Western consumerism.
But the first intuition of Jean - Paul II is correct: the post-Communist world (East and West) is experiencing a spiritual crisis and the Pope would like to shake it by bringing it to become aware of the importance of higher values.
Indeed, by his words and by the example he shows the Pope disrupts the world: the latter wish to live in wealth and comfort and the Pope reminds us that we must also live in dignity.
No label can finally apply to Jean - Paul II who often embodies a set of opposites: rejection of the compromise / ecumenism, toughness / enthusiasm, intellectual openness / insistence on theological orthodoxy.
It is a love curator of freedom and an advocate of peace who condemns injustice, but reminds us that mercy is more important than justice.
It is in this that he embodies the paradox that is Christianity: sacred and sustainable principles associated with understanding and tolerance.
Twenty-five years after the departure of Jean - Paul II to Rome, we, Poles, him remain grateful for having helped us regain our freedom.
It is a good thing that Jean - Paul II is among us.
A world in which everything changes needs a guard to watch over what does not change.
The interventionist syndrome.
Kosovo often plays the role of conflict - test for the "humanitarian" intervention concept.
But while the Iraq enters the spiral of chaos, diplomats and leaders of all nationalities are wondering again whether it is appropriate for alliances of nations or the international community to intervene when a sovereign country appears unable or unwilling to defend its citizens against genocide, war crimes or ethnic cleansing.
At the centre of this debate is the so-called doctrine of the "responsibility to protection".
As a mediator in Kosovo appointed by Nations - United these past five years, I had the unique opportunity to observe the effects of this doctrine after the intervention of NATO in the former Yugoslavia in 1999.
Kosovo has become an international experience of construction of society, led by the administrative Mission ad interim of the United Nations in Kosovo (UNMIK).
Experience is the right word here.
Indeed, Kosovo has turned into the international response test tube.
I've lived and worked long enough in Kosovo to see the result, and I contend that such experiments require further research.
It is clear that the need for international intervention in a crisis depends on each specific period, and a rapid reaction is often necessary.
However, military factors set aside, there where such interventions are considered it is vital to focus the discussions of international policy on the deployment of a civilian presence and security related one to the other.
It is even more true when human suffering is caused by community conflicts, as was the case in Kosovo.
The immediate deployment of a civilian presence and adequate security directly after the end of the 1999 NATO bombing could provide appropriate mechanisms to protect against the return of stick that allowed victims to become torturers.
NATO peacekeeping forces had no mission is to prevent the abductions, disappearances, murderous revenge and the destruction of properties by Albanian ethnic groups, which has led to a vast ethnic cleansing reversed of the non - Albanian population (mostly Serbian).
Consequence of this neglect, a social and political residue deleterious permeates the current Kosovo.
Rather than appease community conflicts, inter-ethnic hatred is more virulent than ever.
In addition to the lack of a civilian presence and security to reassure every community, the lack in general of judicial mechanism to render rapid justice for crimes committed during and after the intervention has created additional tension.
This tension is so pervasive, in fact, that any perspective to start if necessary process of reconciliation must now be pushed back to a distant future.
Similarly, in Kosovo the international community spent that little time to help veterans to consider their collective responsibility for the atrocities, as their personal involvement was direct or indirect.
Without such an effort, try to improve the situation is to build a House on a pile of sand.
This lack of foresight and projects concerning the aftermath of armed intervention is not only dangerous for the officially "rescued" people, it's also counter - productive.
When a humanitarian intervention is not structured to ensure basic security, - underlying antagonisms that inspired the intervention at the base is only strengthened, and not diminished.
Six years after the intervention of NATO, Kosovo seems further away than ever the stability and social peace.
Despite assurances renewed of the authorities of the United Nations that Kosovo is on the path of reconciliation and genuine autonomy, NATO representatives indicate that there are projects of maintaining a long-term military presence in the province to "ensure that the political process will be implemented successfully".
This brings me to another key point: a possible exit strategy is as important to the success of any future humanitarian intervention as the input policy.
For international intervention has a real chance to succeed, it should from the outset to define the criteria for "success".
Only such clarity can allow to correctly an end to the commitment of international actors.
In Kosovo, such clarity is and has been lacking; Therefore, NATO and the UN have no clear idea about when or how they should both withdraw.
One day, someone said accurately that it is easy to bomb, but much more difficult to rebuild; It is relatively easy to defeat a regime militarily, but it is much harder to build a strong and sustainable civil society in its place.
The General Assembly of the United Nations should keep this idea in memory when it will begin to codify the doctrine of the "responsibility to protection".
The divisions of the right in Central Europe.
The Eastern Europe it will be sent to a certain political stability?
Since 1989, the results of the elections have ceased to oscillate between the right and the left.
Ellie Orban, the young and skilled Hungarian Prime Minister he will put an end to this situation?
Thanks to a brutal programme to absorb his political rivals on the right, FIDESZ (Hungarian Civic Party) came to have almost as many adherents as the Socialist Party on the left.
It has also benefited from the Socialist Party internal conflicts that have troubled one of his main political strengths: his strict discipline and professionalism, inherited from communism.
The efforts made by Ellie Orban to gather under the banner of FIDESZ a divided right have been partially successful and are unique in Eastern Europe.
Since the collapse of communism, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, the moderate right-wing parties are fragmented and lack a true political perspective.
Although these countries is not yet fully identified several tens of years of Communist management, divisions of the right have facilitated the electoral victory of the left, sometimes embodied by the ex - Communist.
The forces of right in Central Europe face problems similar to those encountered by the parties of the right elsewhere in Europe, where we see the Social - Democrats recovering liberal ideas, send to occupy them alone the centre of the political spectrum.
In Central Europe, this phenomenon was amplified because the parties in power, all the spectrum, had to privatize the economy and introduce under pressure from the European Union, reforms which in the West would have been completed by the right.
In several countries of Central Europe, the left parties have been better positioned to accomplish these reforms than the right because, paradoxically, they have greater legitimacy for this.
Many people think that the Socialists would not launch in privatizations or would not address social protection if it had not required absolute.
In Central Europe, the fundamental problem of the right is its lack of clearly defined identity.
Although politicians of the moderate right formally traditional ideologies, liberalism or conservatism for example, claim their electorate, unaccustomed to the Western political concepts, does not always include the meaning of these terms.
Many polls show that a significant part of the electorate of the various countries of Central Europe ranks it - even right, but decades of paternalistic type communism have clearly moved to the left the centre of gravity in the region.
Thus, a person may simultaneously declare themselves liberal and ask that the Government continues to subsidize the energy, education and housing.
Under the Communist regimes, the ideology was only a mere instrument in the service of power.
As at that time, even today many people formally accept ideological labels, but is claim that insofar as they can withdraw a tangible benefit in the short term.
This cynicism to ideologies causes abrupt reversals of the electorate.
The problem of identity is further exacerbated by the resurgence of nationalism. Most of the countries of Central Europe in which the construction of national identity has been delayed by Communism succumb to nationalist sentiments that can be manipulated by politicians.
Although some of them say right in the image of Vladimir Meciar, former Slovak Premier themselves are actually populist demagogues and authoritarian.
The current situation of the right in the countries of Central Europe was also due to their history and their traditions.
Political developments in Czechoslovakia during the last twenty years of communism kept away the Czech Republic and Slovakia the Poland and the Hungary.
While the Poland and the Hungary experienced under communism internal liberalization that allowed that part of the activity escapes semi - officially to Communist control, Czechoslovakia had a strict neo - Stalinist regime after the Soviet invasion of 1968.
In 1989, when the Communist regimes collapsed, the Communist parties of Poland and Hungary turned into parties of the left, democratic and credible. They were able to effectively oppose the right-wing parties which is created.
But in Czechoslovakia, the rigid communist party was unable to give birth to a democratic party strong, ink left.
Faced with this vacuum, the moderate right had hands free and was able to retain a certain unity until 1997.
But the absence of a strong opposition contributed to the decline of the right who split and lost a common language.
In Slovakia, countries in which nationalist sentiments have played an important role after 1989, the political forces are not divided at the moment on a right - left axis.
The major political battles take place between the nationalist and populist forces on the one hand, anti-democratic essence, and on the other hand l forces who are fighting for democracy.
The threat of the return to power of Meciar led all Democrats, right and left, to be placed in a camp.
Even in these circumstances, the right remains divided, allowing a possible return to power by Meciar.
In Hungary, the right was the victim of the opposition between conservatives and populists on one side and Liberals essentially owned the urban classes on the other.
Right-wing parties do not yet began agree to if they need to align on the traditional Western-inspired ideologies or a form of conservative nationalism in the Hungarian.
Although the coalition currently in power, consisting of conservatives and populists, has won some successes, the moment of truth from the right is not yet come.
The Polish right represents the most difficult case.
Its problems date back to the days of communism, when the Solidarity Trade Union has become the main movement of opposition to the Communists, while trade unions are generally left.
Since the fall of communism, various bands of solidarity wanted to embody the right, sowing disorder in political discourse.
Christian parties--Democrats related to the Church and the liberal parties were to some extent marginalized.
The situation is even more complex that it takes with the populist and nationalist parties. They are relatively powerful, because they can rely on the peasantry constituting an important electoral base in Poland.
As in other post-Communist countries, these are essentially left democratic forces that have benefited from the divisions of the right.
Fed up with Wal - Mart?
Want to-know you what video - clip will soon be shaking policymakers around the world?
Economist Thomas Holmes, a scenario that looks unsettling way in the dissemination of a global epidemic, has prepared a dynamic map simulation showing the expansion of stores Wal - Mart to States - United.
Starting with the epicenter in Bentonville, Arkansas, where Sam Walton opened his first store in 1962, the big - box stores [stores - boxes] Giants Wal - Mart now have proliferated to the point that the average American lives now within seven miles of one of these shops.
It is interesting to note that shops are moving like the petals of a flower which thicken and extend.
Rather than jump straight to the coast, since 80% of Americans live within a radius of 80 km of the Atlantic or the Pacific, Wal - Mart has expanded organically through a chain of suppliers in constant expansion.
Even if each new shop steals a portion of the clientele of the Wal - Mart established stores in the vicinity, effectiveness of supplies of continuous improvement helps maintain the overall growth of the chain.
We love it or hate, Wal - Mart is undoubtedly the perfect example of costs and benefits of modern globalization.
Consumers are spending considerably less than in traditional stores.
For example, economists consider that the food at Wal - Mart costs 25% less expensive than in a regular supermarket chain.
The difference in prices for many other products of consumption is even greater.
See the following astonishing fact: with a few other stores in the same style: Target, Best Buy and Home Depot, Wal - Mart accounts for approximately 50% of productivity growth vaunted America from Europe during the last ten years.
Fifty percent!
And the same kind of progress among the chains of wholesalers account for 25% extra!
So, the idea that Americans have become better in all while other rich countries stagnated is very wrong.
The U.S. productivity miracle and the emergence of Wal - Mart style trade are virtually synonymous.
I have nothing against these large hypermarkets.
They are a boon to consumers on low incomes, and compensate in part for the tepid wage growth which many of them suffered over the past two decades.
And I do not agree with some of my friends who noses Wal - Mart stores and claim there have ever set foot.
As a consumer, I love the big - box stores.
It is also certainly the case of the trading partners of America; Wal - Mart alone accounts for more than 10% of all U.S. imports from China.
But I have still a few reservations about the Wal - Mart used model as a blueprint of global growth.
Firstly, there is the question of its effect on low-wage workers and smaller retailers.
Surveys show that, while still remaining in legality, its social policies exploit regulatory gaps which, for example, allow it to escape the burden of the costs of health for many employees (Wal - Mart provides coverage of health less than half of its employees).
The arrival of these hypers in a community crushes long established retailers, and often turn their impressive personality.
Yes, up to a certain point, is the price of progress.
But the loss of aesthetics and the community calculated not just through statistics on revenues and prices.
The big - box stores are not really nice, from which their name [large cans].
If their explosive growth continues over the next 20 years, Americans consider - they one day their proliferation as a spectacular example of the failure of balanced regional growth models?
Certainly, many Europeans, and others, would the video simulation of Holmes reproducing the development of Wal - Mart as a horror film.
The French have can - be invented the hypermarket, ancestor of the big box store, but they have never had the intention of letting it grow without control.
The big question for Europeans is whether if they can find ways to harness some of the efficiency gains embodied by the Wal - Mart without so far exceed it model.
For Americans, is also the question of what to do when the phenomenon of big - box stores will lose momentum.
If so much of the US productivity is really reduced to leave Wal - Mart and its cousins the supermarkets continue their demented expansion, that is it will pass when this source of growth will run out?
The US economy has many other forces, including its superior financial system and its dominant position in high-tech equipment, but the fact is that the advantage of States - United in this sector has not currently been as striking as the Wal - Mart phenomenon.
It is curious to see how many people seem to think that the US will grow faster than Europe and Japan over the next ten years, simply because this is what has happened over the last ten years.
Wal - Mart and others constitute a central element of our era of modern globalization.
They are not really the epidemic that their explosive pattern of development reveals, but their emergence is not nor totally benign.
Those who wish to emulate US productivity trends must ask today what they would think of the appearance of stores in the form of boxes punctuating their campaign, pulling down wages and causing the death of small retailers.
The Americans, for their part, must think about the place where the right balance between aesthetics, community and small price.
Accept the science.
Long-term economic progress is mainly enabled by the invention and dissemination of improved technologies.
The scientific revolution was made possible by the printing press, the industrial revolution by the steam engine and if the India escapes the famine, it is thanks to increasing crop yields, the so-called 'green revolution'.
The era of globalization we are experiencing has emerged with the spread of computers and the Internet.
So, when we seek solutions to some of the most difficult global problems, we can also find them, at least in part, in new technology to solve old apparently insoluble problems.
Take the example of poverty in Africa.
All possible explanations have been put forward, and generally put his finger on what Africans do wrong.
But a visit to African villages made clear that the problem is related to the struggle for survival under difficult physical conditions to any another problem inherent in African societies.
African farmers produce about one-third (or even less) less food per hectare than other operators in the world, as a consequence a famine on a large scale, exacerbated by the heavy burden of the disease.
Malaria is a challenge unique in its kind, due primarily to the mosquito species in Africa, particularly suited to transmit the disease.
Other parasitic tropical diseases are also heavy flails on the continent.
Add - y the practical difficulty represented by the bad roads and the scarcity of cars and trucks, and economic isolation follows.
The challenges of survival are therefore enormous.
Practical solutions are yet available, because simple and inexpensive technology can solve some specific problems.
You can remedy the low crop yields through improved seeds, specially adapted to African conditions, associated technologies to enrich the soil and water management.
Malaria can be controlled through new nets to the long service life and a new generation of effective drugs.
Other tropical diseases can be controlled, and practical to obtain drinking water technologies reduce consistently diarrhoeal diseases.
Mobile phones, local Internet wireless and more roads could contribute greatly to the economic isolation of African villages.
Donor countries incessantly ask Africans to change their trade policies, their governmental institutions, administrations and much more.
Some of these changes are important, but rich countries sometimes leave their role focusing on everything except on how to finance and introduce practical technologies to solve practical problems.
Errors of the rich countries would not result if African countries had enough money to adopt technologies themselves, but Africa is so poor that she needs financial assistance to get out of poverty.
The challenges of development in Africa are just an example of how difficult societies problems can be resolved through the design and dissemination of improved technologies.
The same thing will be valid for the choices that will be made of the best way to solve the problem of climate change caused by man - another one of those seemingly intractable global problems.
For now, the rich countries change global climate by emitting millions of tons of carbon dioxide each year by the use of coal, oil and natural gas.
In the years to come, China and the India will also greatly contribute to the increase in the rate of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
And yet no country, whether rich or poor, a really want to reduce its energy consumption, worried at the idea that one such approach could threaten jobs, revenues and economic growth.
New technologies will bring a very important solution.
Already, "hybrid" cars, which combine gasoline and battery, can roughly double the fuel efficiency and halve emissions of carbon dioxide.
In addition, engineers have developed the techniques of capture and storage underground and secure of the carbon dioxide resulting from the combustion of coal in power stations.
This new technology can reduce 80% the emission of carbon dioxide during the production of electricity.
The costs are relatively modest.
Also consider the depopulation of the oceans due to overfishing.
Global demand for fish is increasing, as well as the global capacity of fishing, which threatens endangered species.
Improved aquaculture, where fish are grown in reservoirs and ponds, is still far from being a perfect technology, including for environmental reasons, and yet it is very promising.
During a recent visit to Africa, an eminent agronomist said that in today's world, the scientist is more than near the farmer, but later never ever of the legislature.
Politicians do not understand science, and rarely seek the advice of scientists and engineers when they want to solve major problems.
Everything is seen from the angle of politics and elections, and nothing is considered a technical problem requiring technological expertise, which is the reason why African poverty is so often attributed to corruption rather than ecological challenges.
It is easy to dismiss the suggestion that technology may be the solution.
After all, technological advances also require a good government, market forces, the University effective and more.
There, the policy also has a role to play.
Whatever it is, it is time to recognize that Governments are ill-equipped to understand the sophisticated technological challenges and opportunities which the world could enjoy, and that new methods are needed to make sure that is given to science and technology the position needed to address a wide range of global issues taking a more urgent nature.
It is now time that all the major international agencies and Governments take the responsibility to use scientific and technological expertise they will need in the 21st century.
Unlock the situation in Latin America.
One of the greatest puzzle - the world economy is undoubtedly the poor performance of the Latin America.
Since the beginning of the 1980s, Latin America has been blocked, with per capita incomes growing slowly (if income there) in the majority of the region and with a major crisis in repetition.
Many policies have been attempted, particularly the liberalisation of trade, privatization of inefficient State enterprises and fiscal reforms.
However, something prevents the Latin America progress.
The lack of vigorous growth is even more disconcerting in light of the many benefits and social achievements of the Latin America.
Natural resources are abundant and fertile lands abound.
Sanitary conditions are relatively acceptable and all the countries of Latin America have made progress against illiteracy, the majority at least getting 90% of adult literacy.
In addition, fertility rates have sharply, reaching a rate to which the populations of many countries probably stabilize in the coming decades.
The status of women has improved, and girls enjoy equal access to education, with enrolment rates higher than boys in many countries.
Latin America is probably known for its "macho" culture, but the rate of women in the active population continues to grow and occupy more and more political and social leadership positions.
The Latin America boast other benefits in the long term.
Most of its citizens live on the sides and enjoy privileged access to international trade, and others live in cities, another advantage for growth.
Indeed, the region is not poor criteria international, but instead locked in the range of average income between the poorest countries of the world and the high-income countries of America North, Europe and East Asia.
How to explain, then, the lack of real growth over the past 25 years?
I rejects the responsibility on two problems solved, but soluble.
The first existed for centuries: the social divisions whose origins date to the European conquest of native Americans in the sixteenth century.
Even more than in other countries, Latin America was born during a violent conquest.
Europeans have subjected Amerindian populations and also brought, in particular in the basin of the Caribbean and Brazil, massive cargo of African slaves.
Societies became racially and ethnically complex when European, Amerindian and African populations have practiced mixed marriages, but the trend in the long term of European dominance, the enslavement of indigenous and afro - American, and strongly entrenched poverty have profoundly influenced societies of Latin America.
Even today, inequalities of income in Latin America are among the largest in the world, reflecting old patterns of ethnic and racial division.
Income inequality casts a large shadow.
The rich are struggling for a long time against the taxes necessary to increase investment in the sector of education and health of the poor, perpetuating deep social divisions and leaving many people without the health and skills required by the global competitiveness.
Today, the situation improves in some countries, as in Brazil, which bodes well for the future.
In other countries, such as the Guatemala and parts of the Andean region, social divisions remain tainted by violence and mistrust.
In addition to this problem, a fundamental failure of the economic strategy has been widely ignored, a failure which is reflected in the major difference between the discussions on public policy in Latin America and Asia.
In Asia, the public debate on technology: how Asia can catch up?
Asian governments act with persistence to increase scientific and technological savings capabilities.
In Latin America, the world's technological revolution is much less debated and national policies to promote science and technology rarely climb in the foreground.
Result, Latin America has failed to properly leverage the global technological revolutions.
Developing Asian countries now produce computers, and semi - conductors, pharmaceuticals and software.
By contrast, even the seller star of Latin America, the Chile, remains largely an export economy based on resources, massively concentrated on exports of copper and agricultural products.
These sectors are technologically sophisticated, but form a narrow base for development in the long term.
The situation is far from hopeless.
The Brazil demonstrated predisposition to be a technological export power.
He managed, obviously, to export planes and of many consumer durables.
The Mexico has also begun to mobilize knowledge - considerable technological do.
Argentina, the Chile and other countries could become agricultural producers of advanced, the vanguard of agro - biotechnology for example, if they gave the penalty.
Nevertheless, the countries of Latin America have not yet tried to trigger a technological revolution, certainly not with the degree of importance, competence, commitment and funding have shown Asian countries.
Such a boost could play a major role in the take-off of economic growth.
Such a policy would commit to significantly increase spending for research and development, as developing Asian countries have done.
The countries of Latin America must increase spending to 2% of GDP (currently 0.5%), in part through public support to laboratories and universities, in part by incentives for research and development of the private sector. They must place the welcome mat to leading multinational companies, as did Asia.
They should also focus more on scientific and technological training and encourage a greater proportion of students to receive university education.
Government stipends for schooling and for new universities as well as enlarged universities can play an important role, like investments in computers and information technology in schools and communities.
The social and technological programs depend on one another.
Both require companies to Latin America to further invest in individuals who are affected by these programs so that Latino - Americans can be put at the forefront of the advances in global productivity.
If these investments affect all the countries of Latin America, both the rich that the poor, the prospects of the region will illuminate considerably.
The price of the estate: a House of cards?
The first major city to know a boom was London, around 1996.
This attitude spread to Los Angeles, New York and Sydney around 1997 and Paris in 1998, Miami, Moscow, and Shanghai in 2001 and Vancouver in 2002.
These cities and others have seen real estate prices ignite since that time - there. Prices are mounted by at least 50% in constant prices since 2000.
It was the source of significant windfall profits for the owners but also source of problem for anyone preparing to acquire real estate.
Today, the increase in real estate prices is lower in some of these cities.
Growth in London and New York strongly slowed during the past year, fell 1% about a real increase in the second quarter of 2004.
Sydney, house prices actually fell during the second quarter.
Is this the end of the boom?
No other city will benefit?
Worse yet, the mood of the real estate markets could - it lead to a fall in prices?
No one had predicted this boom, so predicting its end is risky.
Real estate prices have demonstrated a terrible upward movement against the previous warnings from the end of the day.
Any prediction about the end of the boom requires an understanding of the reasons for its development in so many different cities.
Curiously, there is no generally accepted explanation because the ultimate causes of this boom are mainly psychological.
Economists prefer to discuss the interest rate or statistics of unemployment, concrete and likely to be known factors.
Of course, these indicators have a legitimate role to play in the explanation of the real estate markets, but they are simply not sufficient to explain the recent booms.
Three psychological causes stand out from all this: first, a change in the perception of the public regarding sources of value in a changing global economy, and the growing confidence of the public in the "glamorous" whose name cities is known worldwide and finally simple heady speculative bubble dynamics.
Each factor deserves greater attention if you want to understand the current market conditions and discern future price trends.
First, the world economy appears more chaotic that it appeared ten years ago.
The fall of the price of the shares since 2000 in most countries gives a little reassuring to financial goods, stimulating the "refuge towards the quality", or in this case to the stone.
Moreover, terrorism is now perceived as a problem for everyone, the Indonesia, the Spain and the Russia who have suffered their own tragedy.
We can rest assured by investing in stone and there is little reason to expect an imminent change.
Fear and soaring real estate prices to encourage each other.
Then, the confidence of the public in the glamorous international cities is increasing thanks to the explosive growth of global communications through the Internet and the mobile phone.
Like most still admire international celebrities, one perceives the international centres of business, technology and culture recognized - and whose names are familiar to everyone, everywhere - have a unique value.
As for the fear of terrorism and the lack of confidence in the stock markets, geographical celebrity appears elastic not to say autorenforcee: more New York, Paris and London are famous, more they prove attractive.
Finally, speculative contagion that sous - tend any bubbles cannot be ignored.
The current boom has seen the contagion spread to the Interior markets and across markets, the rise in prices feeding popular excitement - and thus higher prices it - even - in the same city, then in other cities, to the other side of the planet.
The inhabitants of Shanghai debate can - be no prices of real estate in London, but the leaders of public opinion in Shanghai know what happen in London, and all boom occurring in this city makes the possibility of a boom in plausible Shanghai.
As opposed to the other two psychological reasons, speculative contagion has a natural end.
A speculative bubble, which feeds it - even only on the reaction to the rise in prices, cannot go on indefinitely.
So, where that we he leads?
Two of the psychological causes suggest a continuous real estate prices rise while the third suggests the end of this movement to a higher one of these days, without specifying when.
I bet that some of the cities if highly attractive will continue to attend to the slowdown in the growth of real estate prices, then their decline eventually.
Historically, the price of real estate has always demonstrated strong movements, and prices in all these cities still grow at a rate important, although it is usually somewhat slower than a year ago or two.
If we extrapolate the growth trends, it seems reasonable to predict that prices will continue to grow substantially in most of these cities for a year or two, even if the growth rate continues to decline.
Psychological factors are more important for long-term forecasts to the - beyond one year, when the upward movement do more play such an important role.
At this stage, the price will be probably unstable downward, because that enthusiasm for investment in the stone will probably collapse at the same time as the decline of the price growth.
The prices in glamour cities will fall significantly in the next recession or when the economy will suffer are next shock important or even if interest rates rise too quickly.
Then the contagion across markets and inside will fall, by falling prices for years.
Water for all.
This month -, once more, water occupies the front of the stage at the fourth Global Forum of the water in Mexico.
It is a timely moment: while the attention of a large part of the world is focused on energy, supply and security issues, hundreds of millions of people in developing countries, still fresh as all water supply also consider important, if not more.
Surveys conducted by the World Bank in developing countries show that, when we ask poor people to name the three most important challenges they face, their 'good health' is still part of this list.
And the key element that determines if they will keep this healthy remains access to clean water.
Today, worldwide, more than a billion people have no access.
As a result, they are always easier prey to ill health.
The World Bank estimates that in 2035, nearly three billion people, almost all in developing countries, could live in very severe water shortage conditions, especially if they live in Africa, the Middle East or South Asia.
This will cause obvious problems, but it will also impede the economic growth necessary to these millions of people to escape poverty.
In Latin America, nearly 15% of the population, or nearly 76 million people, has no access to safe drinking water, and 116 million people have access to any health service.
The numbers are worse for Africa and parts of Asia.
It is a situation faced by few people in rich countries.
Usually, the citizens of these countries benefit from public services that meet all their water needs, from drinking to irrigation and health needs.
In addition, other water-related issues, such as the risks posed by floods, have been reduced to manageable levels.
Rich industrial countries have invested very early and massively in infrastructure, institutions, and management of water.
The results, to-beyond health benefits that it provides to all, have provided evidence of record economic growth: it is sufficient to examine hydroelectric investments to understand the positive impact of water management projects in many countries.
Of course, the rich countries have some advantages: they generally enjoy moderate climates where the rains are regular and generally have little risk of drought or flood.
Even so, they are not immune to water-related disasters, such as the destruction of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina has shown.
But the impact of such events on poor countries is far more important.
The extreme variations in rainfall, floods and droughts can have social and economic effects and result in loss of human lives on a large scale.
The coast of the Gulf of Mexico and the Central American countries are constantly experience such tragedies, communities impoverished the most vulnerable and the least able to handle these events.
Two examples are Ethiopia and the Yemen also one than the other.
The development potential of Ethiopia is so closely linked to the seasonal rains that wide variations in rainfall and the lack of infrastructure, has undermined growth and perpetuated poverty.
A simple drought may reduce the potential for growth of 10% in the long term.
Yemen, meanwhile, has no permanent surface water and its citizens are totally dependent on rainfall, groundwater and flooding.
To go forward, developing countries need new infrastructure and better management of water.
Any approach must be designed in relation to the specific context of each country and the needs of their respective people, but there is no constraint database linked to the investment operation of water that ensures that local communities and the environment could derive tangible benefits quickly.
In some countries, the establishment of new infrastructures for water usually means the creation of canals, pumping stations and dams.
Other countries may need deeper reservoirs, stations most modern purification or improved water transportation systems.
All of this can possibly be designed to improve and expand the water supply for power generation, irrigation, and industrial and private use, while ensuring a measure of security against droughts and some protection against flooding.
The key to the success of any increase of investment in the infrastructure of water st proportionally increasing investment in the institutions that manage the water.
If the infrastructure is poorly managed, this will not help to improve the health of the population or sustain economic growth: water development and water management must operate pair.
Infrastructure can and should be developed in parallel with good institutions, well managed, in respect for the environment and with an equitable sharing of costs and profits.
An investment policy in water which reduces the vulnerability of the poor and provides basic access to water for all requires a custom handling and a specific partnership between donor countries, the Governments of developing countries, the private sector and local communities.
World Water Forum delegates will have multiple opportunities to forge and strengthen these partnerships.
If successful, the benefits that will take poor people around the world will be immense.
The Germany in economic shock.
Over the past ten years, the Germany has experienced the slowest economic growth of the European Union, and the slower growth of the World Europe.
From 1995 to 2005, German growth will not exceed 14.6%, while the average of the old EU was 24%, that of the States - United 39.9%, and that of the global economy 45.6%.
Why is that so bad results of the Germany?
According to Franz MÃ¼ntefering, head of the parti social - democrat at the head of the Germany, it is simply because the country is already there where others want to go.
Slow German growth, supports - it is a sign of natural convergence.
This theory is far from convincing.
The Germany has recently doubled in terms of income per head per from many EU countries, including Ireland, United - Kingdom, the country - down and the France, and its growth remains slower than theirs.
Another more plausible theory is that over the past fifteen years several external challenges, or shock, simultaneously shook the country.
Trapped by its rigidity, its extensive social system and a highly regulated labour market, the Germany has proved unable to react to these shocks and began to have problems.
This theory is not reminiscent of the British historian Arnold Toynbee, according to which empires collapse because they are unable to respond to external challenges.
The first shock was the intensification of globalisation, which caused the influx of competition at low wages.
Although globalization is a gradual process, it has gained energy when China decided to enter the game.
China is ten times the size of Japan, and the Japan was not very easy to manage.
Precision instruments and the German optical equipment, for example, have lost their competitiveness when the Japan came into scene.
The second shock was that of European integration, including enlargement to the North and the South.
The dismantling of internal borders of the EU has suddenly expanded the size of national markets and caused the economies of scale provided.
But this phenomenon has further promoted the small European countries than large, and has involved more competition for Germany, the biggest economy of Europe.
Take Nokia, the manufacturer of mobile phones.
Through the economies of scale made possible by the common market, Nokia was able to fully exploit its inventions, while the German Siemens recently had to decide to abandon the market of mobile phones.
The third shock was the euro. The European currency has caused a rapid convergence of long-term interest rates, which in some countries have reached up to 5 to 7 percentage points more than in Germany.
Freed from the risks related to exchange rates, international investors require more premium risk in these countries and willingly provide all funds on favourable terms, what was previously the preserve of the Germany.
Europe did in tire that profits, because capital are now better spread and growth stimulated through the displacement of German regions distant and formerly disadvantaged of the eurozone economies.
On the other hand, the benefit is doubtful for German workers who also wanted to take advantage of this capital.
The fourth shock took the form of enlargement to the East of the EU, that caused extraordinary opportunities of trade and investment, but also the surge of labor at low prices.
On average, the salary levels in the ten countries that joined the EU in 2004 represent only 14% of those in Western Germany.
Low-wage competition has led to substantial relocation and activities off - shore which enabled German companies to remain competitive by reducing their demand for national work.
Given that neither the unions nor the German social system could not accept reductions in wages, the consequence was an increase in unemployment and slower growth.
The fifth shock, it is the unification of Germany, a failure in terms of economy.
GDP per person in age to work in East Germany represented 61% of the level of the Germany of the West in 1996, but it fell today to 59%.
The slow growth of the East of the country has lowered the average German, while the enormous demand for public funds that widen the public debt.
The weakness of the fiscal position has in turn undermined the confidence of investors, with an obvious impact on economic growth.
These five shocks constitute historical developments beneficial to the world as a whole, but problematic for the Germany.
If the country wants to face its challenges and continue to grow, it needs to make the labour market more flexible.
Only if wages adjust downward to adapt to the new global environment that German workers become competitive, and that the country will again have a low rate of unemployment, by exploiting its human capital up to the capacity constraint.
The new Government that voters are likely to choose in September will be faced with the difficult task of putting the Germans face the reality and to introduce the necessary reforms.
It is only then we will know if the Germany is able to face the challenge of Toynbee that awaits him.
Lessons from the tsunami.
Many lessons emerge from the tsunami, cause so much devastation and loss of human lives in Asia.
It is evidence of globalization, while television showed striking images of the destruction of homes in the world.
Indeed, it is in these moments - where the world really looks like a global village.
Of course, it seems that the information on the scale of the disaster take longer to reach the ranch of president Bush in Crawford, Texas.
But, finally, he decided to interrupt his vacation to deliver aid which the amount has ceased to be revised upwards in an international competition which promised to benefit those who were desperately waiting to be helped.
Still, U.S. aid seems petty in comparison with the amounts offered by countries which have only a fraction of American wealth.
Australia, which is sparsely populated, has offered more than double U.S. aid, the Japan promised 50% more than America and Europe is committed on a sum five times greater.
This has allowed many observers point out that the richest country in the world was actually the most destitute in terms of international assistance, especially when it is compared to the amounts committed in defence and the war.
This disaster is international, also is - it appropriate that the United Nations take the lead for the coordination of the humanitarian effort.
Unfortunately, in an effort that was widely seen as a new attempt to undermine multilateralism, States - United have tried to take the head of a "core group" of assistance programme, ignoring the ongoing efforts within the region and under the aegis of the United Nations.
Whatever the reason for America, she decided later to wisely join the United nations in their efforts.
The rhetoric used to save the face of the Bush administration claiming that it was to establish a core group in the absence of any other effort has slowly abandoned.
The response of some countries of the region was truly impressive, showing the progress made in the implementation of efficient and effective Governments.
Myriads of details were examined: the Thailand sent ambassadors to the affected areas of the country to help meet the needs of citizens, helped those who have lost everything, passport and property, to repatriate, treated the wounded, put in place systems for the identification of the bodies and dealt with the difficulties posed by the shortage of bags and the lack of places chilled for conservation of the body.
Countries that as the Thailand have perceived that they could cope with the financial consequences by themselves have requested that humanitarian aid be sent to other countries.
They have asked only one thing: the reduction of customs duties and access to foreign markets.
They were not asking the charity, just a chance to earn their own income.
They did receive in response, at least at the moment where I write these lines, only a relentless silence.
Moreover, the G7 has chooses to contribute significantly by offering to relieve debt.
This is particularly important in the case of Indonesia, the debt service amounting to $ 132 billion USD, including 70 owed to public creditors or guaranteed by governmental authorities.
Even without the horrors of the tsunami, the weight of this debt would have represented a huge handicap in the development of this country recovering from the consequences of the financial crisis of 1997.
Indeed, the Indonesian debt relief is a convincing case insofar as most of the debts were incurred on the occasion of the corrupt Suharto Government loans.
Executives knew, or should have known, that a portion of all loan amounts would not be attributed to the development of the Indonesia.
In addition, a portion of the debt was incurred during the crisis of 1997-1998, aggravated and extended by the policies imposed by the IMF.
Nobody claims that it is possible to alter or prevent the forces of nature.
We must rather learn to manage them.
We now talk about improved warning systems to prevent possible tsunamis.
We have already, however, received a warning in the area of climate change.
Most countries recognize it and gathered at Rio and Kyoto to act together: even if it is insufficient, the Kyoto Protocol was designed as a first step in the right direction.
Unfortunately, the warming of the planet will probably destroy the same countries as those who come to be ravaged by the tsunami.
Low altitude as the Maldives Islands will be submerged.
We are not yet a global village.
After challenging the scientific evidence highlighting the problems, the biggest polluter on the planet, the States - United, has simply refused to act to the - beyond of the simple call to some voluntary restriction that one sees little to the work, in any case in America.
The international community must still consider the treatment to this aberrant Member who refuses to take his responsibilities as global citizens.
Optimists say that technology will solve these problems.
The realists will find that in the long run breath between technology and the environment, it seems that technology is the big loser so far.
Nature, as demonstrated by the tsunami, has its own clock.
As long as we have not learned to comply, we will all miss the train.
The accuracy of the experts.
Every day, experts bombard us their views on subjects as varied as Iraqi insurgents, Bolivian coca growers, European Central bankers and the Politburo of North Korea.
How are - they credible, these experts?
An optimistic view is that as long as those selling expertise compete vigorously to attract the attention of shrewd buyers (the media), market mechanisms will ensure quality control.
Experts published in newspaper opinion pages, or who spend on television and radio, must certainly enjoy a good reputation because otherwise, they would have been eliminated.
Skeptics warn however that the media impose us their choice of speakers and they are less interested by debates reasoned that by the way of adapting to popular prejudices.
Accordingly, the celebrity may well be related negatively, not positively, long term accuracy.
Until recently, no one knew who was right because nobody kept trace of the results of these experts.
But research over 20 years suggests today that the skeptics are closest to the truth.
I describe the project in detail in my book Expert Political Judgment: How good is it? How can we know?
[The political judgment of experts: worth - it?]
How do I know? The initial idea was to invite thousands of predictions from hundreds of experts about the fates of dozens of countries, and noted these predictions based on their accuracy.
We discovered that not only the media do not eliminate bad ideas, but that they promote them often, especially when the truth is too blurred to be presented clearly.
Evidence are divided into two categories.
First, as to have warned the skeptics, when hordes of experts vying for the ramp lights, many are tempted to claim that they know more than in reality.
Experts providing the worst and the best are those that have the greatest tendency to exaggerate.
Between 1985 and 2005, the most optimistic experts were forecast over 10 years who exaggerated the chances of big positive changes both in the financial markets (e.g. a Dow Jones to 36,000) and in terms of world politics (for example, the quiet in the Middle - East and dynamic growth in Africa sub - Saharan).
They assigned probabilities of 65% to optimistic scenarios that materialized only 15% of cases.
During the same period, the most pessimistic experts themselves are even more misled, by exaggerating the risks of negative changes even where overly optimistic experts had too laden with good news, and in adding many others (I am still awaiting the imminent disintegration of the Canada, Nigeria, the India, the Indonesia, South Africa, the Belgium and the Sudan).
They attributed 70% probabilities to sinister scenarios that materialized only in 12% of cases.
In addition, as yet once predicted the doubters, experts claiming more than in reality rarely pay their errors.
Indeed, media give them much attention while neglecting their smaller colleagues.
We can see this process particularly highlighted when, following the philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin, we classify experts "hedgehogs" and "Foxes".
Hedgehogs are those who have great ideas and are amourachent major theories: libertarianism, Marxism, environmentalism, etc.
Their self-confidence can be contagious.
They know how to maintain the momentum of a discussion by multiplying reasons showing that they are right and others are wrong.
This is what wins them the approval of the media.
But they do not know when support on their mental brakes by making concessions to other points of view.
They take their theories too seriously.
Result: hedgehogs commit more errors, but they accumulate more successful on Google.
Eclectic foxes are more to calm their ideological enthusiasms.
They feel more at ease with prolonged uncertainties about who is right even in bitter debates, admit their shortcomings and give legitimacy to opposing views.
They punctuate their conversations of conjunctions that limit the scope of their arguments: "but", "However", "Although".
As they avoid oversimplifying, foxes are committing fewer errors.
Foxes are often agree with hedgehogs up to a point, before complicating things: "Yes, my colleague is right when he says that the Saudi monarchy is vulnerable, but remember - you that States coups are rare and that the Government has many ways to suppress opposition".
Imagine that your job in the media depends on your ability to expand your audience.
Who would choose - you: an expert who balances conflicting arguments and concludes that the most likely outcome is that nothing will change, or an expert who holds the audience spellbound with stories of radical Islamists who take control and cause a surge in the price of oil?
In short, the qualities that make foxes more likely accuracy make them less popular.
At this point, uncharitable skeptics chortle that we have the media we deserve.
But this is not just.
No company has yet created a reliable method for assessing the results of the experts.
Even the citizens who value accuracy have little means to know they the sacrifice when they change string from boring foxes to the charismatic hedgehogs.
This is where that comes staged a modest proposal which applies to all democracies: the marketplace of ideas works better if it is easier for citizens to see exchanges between accuracy and entertainment, or between accuracy and loyalty to a party.
Wouldn't - they no more reports of experts having had most often reason?
In this case, the experts could become more reliable in showing more humility, and the political debate begin to be less strident.
Agree, it is not easy to create methods for assessing who had reason and which would cover the entire spectrum of reasonable opinions.
But in a world where, as Yeats, 'the worst are full of passionate intensity and the best lack all conviction' said, it is worth trying.
What future for Europe?
In many respects, 2005 represents the annus horibilis of Europe.
It started well, with the approval of the proposed constitutional Treaty by Spanish voters, but it turned sour when french and Dutch voters rejected it shortly after.
These votes reflected partly the voter dissatisfaction with screw - screw - of domestic policies as well as their disappointment toward the Government conduct of European Affairs.
Governments are then dispatched to offer more of these unsatisfactory business.
In the days that followed these elections, they failed to agree on the budget of the European Union for the period 2007-2013.
French and British leaders have embarked on a feud that had derailed the Summit that followed, just before the Great - Britain takes the rotating Presidency of the European Union in July.
Generally, the countries concerned use the Presidency of the European Union to show their ability to solve problems and to advance the European Union.
But since early December, la Grande - Bretagne slumbers.
In addition to the burial of the proposed constitutional Treaty, she has largely abandoned the question of the budget.
There is very little chance that she managed to adopt the budget this year, and, unless quickly resolve the dispute, the European Union will have no operating budget for 2007.
Even if the budget ends up being adopted, the Austrian Presidency, which opens January 1, will not fail absolutely depressing business.
The biggest problem remains the European inability to accelerate its pace of growth and provide jobs to its citizens.
This is mainly due to the big three, the France, the Germany and Italy, which produce 70% of European GDP.
The response collective, adopted in 2000, was that of the "Lisbon strategy", which aims to make the EU "the most competitive and most dynamic economy knowledge" worldwide in 2010.
More realistically, it is designed to offer Governments the necessary encouragement for reforms that slows economic growth and productivity.
This implies the confrontation of a myriad of interest groups, from industrial lobbies to trade unions and bureaucrats frozen, which (so far) have managed to protect their domain.
The strategy is based on the peer pressure and is to point the finger the Governments who are not progressing to confuse them.
In fact, however, the peer pressure turned into collusion of peers.
When European Union leaders gathered last spring to report on their progress, they admitted in a pitiful way that the objectives of the Lisbon strategy were unlikely to be achieved.
They could, at best, now, stop claiming to focus on this strategy and continue their progress in other areas.
Unfortunately, JosÃ© Manuel Barroso, who chaired the Summit of 2000, while he was Prime Minister of the Portugal and president of the European Commission, had put his presidency at stake in the case of the Lisbon strategy.
Expect to see it defend it in a desperate way.
One of the few good ideas of the Lisbon strategy was to remove trade barriers to the exchange of services.
The competition within Europe is restricted by innumerable national regulations which, for example, strictly determine the regulated professions, such as hairdressing or plumbing.
One of the essential features of recent decades remains the significant increase of productivity in the area of services to States - United, but this is absolutely not occurred in Europe.
Guess why.
Because services represent 70% of European GDP and the potential impact of enhanced competition is important.
It is however still difficult, politically, to remove protections.
The European Commission made a proposal in 2005, at the same time that the constitution was submitted to votes.
It is hardly surprising that this proposal has quickly was abandoned.
Today, while a large number of private interest groups try to dilute it to remove all its significance, this battle will certainly be included in the agenda of the European Union for 2006.
Europe also blocks the progress of the Doha round in the international trade negotiations, because of the agricultural lobby fighting to preserve its subsidies.
There are many Governments who fear their farmers to have no other choice than to not cede, whatever the circumstances.
Europe has accepted the idea of a single trade policy.
When the disagreements are so deep that they are in the case of agriculture, there is no discretion to conduct successful negotiations.
There are only few reasons to remain optimistic.
And what will be the future of the ECB, which comes to adjust its interest rates by 0.25% after 30 months of waiting.
Experts can not fall to agree on the relevance of this decision, but nobody is in agreement with the many political leaders who say that this small increase would derail the small resumption of economic growth.
The acidity of the political attacks on the ECB could trigger dangerous discussions on the restriction of its independence.
Even if it is out of the question to happen, because it would require to amend the European Treaty, all this brouhaha is not healthy.
This distracts the ECB's objectives and just fleshing out the idea that Europe is a bad thing, and, above all, this will be used as a scapegoat by Governments failing to explain their failures.
Expected to other anti - ECB reactions.
Europe is - she in a rut?
The current team of leaders has greatly disappointed.
Yet, we have a chance to see dawn light at the end of the tunnel with their gradual replacement.
In Germany, the Chancellor, Angela Merkel, seems more positive on the question of Europe and more scope on reforms than its predecessor, but it has its hands tied by the grand coalition which supports.
In France, president Jacques Chirac, image par excellence of the hostage of its pressure groups leader, staggers helpless way towards the end of its mandate in 2007.
The two heads of file to replace it, Dominique de Villepin and Nicolas Sarkozy, both to the Government, clash on bottom of agendas of reform, but the years that previous an election do not encourage radical changes.
Italy, meanwhile, will have to decide if it wants to replace the Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, showing no interest in reforms and European Affairs, by Romani Prodi, prudent man and former President of the Commission European.
Tony Blair, once champion of Europe (at least according to the undemanding standards of the Great - Britain), may well have to finally cede power to Gordon Brown, who is well known for its lack of warmth towards European integration.
Fortunately, the Grande - Bretagne has always been of an outsider.
Finally, don't shine regardless of light at the end of the tunnel, it may not be until 2007, after the French elections.
Taming politicians on both sides of the Atlantic.
Despite the occasional grumble of politicians, no one doubts seriously European Central Bank independence nor the monetary policy in the euro area is therefore well protected against political pressure.
But the recent death of the stability and Growth Pact, killed by the Germany, his father with a France playing the role of the co - conspirator and complacent accomplice, reminds us a vital lesson: elected politicians find it difficult, if not impossible, to waive an immense power in the field of fiscal policy.
This situation applies in the entire Atlantic.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is of course extremely independent.
But any attempt to limit the fiscal discretion of the U.S. federal Government after the manner of the Stability Pact (for example, Act Gramm / Rudman infamous era Clinton) always collapses at the end before the pressure of the president and the Congress.
In election years, monetary policy can be used to stimulate, if it is longer, an economy, like tax policy, and it is the goal of politicians.
But the unthinking use of one of these two mechanisms to achieve objectives in the short term may create long-term costs, justifying certain restrictions imposed on the latitude that have politicians to influence macroeconomic policies.
When politicians can control inflation by exercising a decisive influence on central banks, they can use their power to devalue the burden of public debt, thus avoiding the need for a supplementary tax to repay this debt.
Such was the great lesson of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s, when rampant inflation has forced politicians to relinquish this power for the benefit of independent central banks which only could convince the markets that the price stability would be restored.
However, monetary policy does not constitute a unique mode of economic policy-making.
Aspects of fiscal policy could also be delegated to independent bureaucrats in order to keep politicians on the ranks.
Why, for example, do not entrust an independent bureaucracy some objectives of redistribution or a control on the level of public investment or management of deficits?
An independent fiscal authority could probably apply the objectives in the long term of a company with these areas better than politicians who have their eyes fixed on the forthcoming elections.
Indeed, in principle, it is impossible to understand why the monetary policy and fiscal policy must be considered so differently, one being entirely delegated to an agency bureaucrat, the other being completely discretionary and left in the hands of politicians.
So, why this vast difference exists in reality both in America and Europe?
Because fiscal policy is the major tool used by politicians to attract and retain the support of a coalition of voters, made up of retirees, officials and owners of the middle classes, while imposing costs on the losing coalition.
It is not necessary to satisfy 100% of voters, but just enough to win.
The income tax card plays a critical role in the selection of groups of voters to buy.
Independent fiscal authorities (or tax rules such as the Stability Pact) hinder this political use of fiscal policy, which is expensive.
After all, if politicians cannot win elections by taking money from some voters (including future generations, who will have to bear a portion of the Bill) to give it to others, they will have to work more hard to show some ability to produce public benefits for all.
This is a much harder task!
Of course, the policy also includes effects of redistribution.
Think about the different effects of the interest rates on debtors versus creditors.
However, monetary policy is much more clumsy, indirect and imprecise way to choose winners and losers than fiscal policy.
Independent central banks can sometimes represent a gene for politicians, but at least, they can serve as scapegoats when necessary, a role whose political benefits outweigh the costs of the loss of control over a useful tool.
These considerations should guide the choice of the device to replace the Pact on stability in Europe.
It is now quite clear that national Governments, and especially those of the larger countries, will never accept substantial limitations on their fiscal discretion.
They may removed temporarily tax freedom of manoeuvre long enough to allow the launch of the euro but, in normal conditions, national Governments will demand their tax territory.
The European Commission must therefore cease to deliver a battle of back - guard who does that weaken its credibility, especially in the eyes of the small countries, which are the only ones on which it is possible to pressure to accept unwanted fiscal rules.
Realistically, the Commission can only ask the European Governments to ensure that their tax accounts are transparent and clear.
It is impossible to prevent the political use of fiscal policy.
But at least the fiscal actions of a country should not be hidden in obscure footnotes of page of its budgets.
Even this limited goal may be hard to achieve.
A strategic lack of transparency is in the interests of clever politicians who want just a pressure group by concealing the generosity of the public costs to the majority of citizens.
The rules that govern the behavior of politicians should not be written as if disinterested and well-meaning officials were going to apply them.
Politicians are ready to give much trouble to satisfy their supporters and win the election.
We can at best hope to ensure that the worst acts they commit has been done openly.
The European Union it will hold faith with the Turkey?
More than forty years ago, the Turkey has applied to become an associate member of the European economic community.
The 1963 association agreement has created a special relationship, crowned by the customs union in 1996.
During all these years, European Governments have ceased to reaffirm that the Turkey could become a full Member State provided they comply with criteria of accession.
The formal recognition of his candidacy in 1999 pushed Turkey to undertake a set of unprecedented reforms in the field of human rights and rights of minorities, including the abolition of the death penalty, the adoption of safeguards against torture, promoting religious freedom and equality between the sexes and the restriction of the role of the army in the life policy.
If the European Union considers that the accession criteria have been met, it shall enter into negotiations in early 2005.
Otherwise the EU would miss its political commitments and would seriously undermine its credibility in the world.
Yet, everywhere in Europe, this accession is envisaged with skepticism, because of the size of the Turkey and its economic situation, fearing a massive immigration and especially "cultural and social differences", a euphemism that makes reference to Islam.
It cannot be denied that some of these factors represent considerable challenges.
But they are often exaggerated and certainly not insurmountable.
Negotiations with the Turkey would be long and membership could not be achieved before 2015.
This period would allow the Turkey to the Union to prepare.
With 80 million inhabitants, the Turkey would become one of the largest Member States of the European Union.
But the role of the size of the country is limited in the decision-making process of the EU, where political influence depends more economic power.
In addition, the Turkey is several decades a responsible member of many European institutions, and there is no reason to think that she would behave differently within the Union.
Due to the weakness of its economy, the Turkey could claim significant aid.
But these transfers would depend on the financial policy of the EU accession, the result of the negotiations and the evolution of the economic situation in Turkey.
In all cases, "cap" practiced by the EU budget would prevent an explosion of the financial cost of the accession of the Turkey.
Immigration should not cause unnecessary concerns.
Human mobility is limited, and Turkish workers would probably have the right to move freely in the European Union after a long period of transition, can - be not before 2025.
Given the strong growth expected in the Turkish economy and the decline in the birth rate, experts believe there would then about 2.7 million immigrants.
Meanwhile, the decline and ageing of the population in most of Europe have made indispensable immigration.
Gold among the countries of probable origin of migrants, the Turkey offers the best chance of successful adaptation.
It is the Muslim population of Turkey that emotion is peaking.
Many have the feeling that the Turkey has no place in a European society based on a culture and Christian traditions.
There is also concern that Islamists make a day of the Turkey a fundamentalist state.
Also unlikely that either, because secularism is strongly rooted in Turkey, this risk cannot be totally dismissed.
But there is in any democracy, where extremist groups could hijack the democratic process to achieve their ends.
The best way to avoid such a disaster is without doubt to strengthen the democratic system, and to firmly anchor Turkey within a block of countries them as democratic.
The European Union, she must decide if she wants to be a "Christian club", or instead a society open, strengthened and enriched by its cultural and religious diversity.
The accession of the Turkey would bring a strong response, with particular resonance in the Muslim world.
The need to challenge the arguments against the accession of the Turkey is that its benefits are rarely mentioned: a geopolitical unique position at the crossroads of the Balkans, South Caucasus, Central Asia and the Middle East - of areas of vital importance to the security of Europe. a major energy transit country; military capabilities, to the moment when the EU is trying to develop its new European defence policy; and a strong economic potential, with one hand d '? young and dynamic work.
At the same time, should take into account the risk of rejection of the Turkey: the probability of the failure of the reform process, which would promote extremist movements and would cause instability and political unrest at the gates of the EU.
The Turkey entering the European Union opens wide perspectives and also carries challenges.
But the Outlook is far superior.
The game of democracy.
At Calcutta, when a younger kid came and insisted on participation in the game that played my friends, we it were to enter, but only after having whispered in the ear of the other words.
When we were kids, it was important to master the cruel art of.
The technique of the.
What applies to children and adults also applies to international institutions.
Indeed, organizations that are officially committed to involving all nations in their decision-making are often controlled by small groups of powerful nations, while others do that accomplish a simulacrum of participation.
The Organization World Trade (WTO), self - saying based on the principle of one country one vote, actually sees his agenda programmed backstage by a small group of nations.
It is now common that international organizations who publish a report involve all the "stakeholders" and reflect their opinions.
The evolving report is then usually presented on a Web site, and all without exception (NGOs, trade unions and other organizations of civil society) are invited to offer suggestions.
This approach promotes a sense of participation, but as a friend, poured into these questions, learned me, the secret is finally to ignore all the comments received and to prepare the report as if there were no Web site and as if no participation had been identified.
More and more, the free expression of the opinion influence or control the behavior of the Government.
Let's take the States - United.
The Americans expressed their views freely, in newspapers, on television, in the discussion forums on the Internet, on the planned war of George Bush in Iraq.
Never before such opposition only manifested towards a war.
What has happened, or rather what has not happened, is admirable: almost no effort has been made to silence criticism of the Government, as is the case in China and several dictatorships.
But the great democracies of the world, the United States, the India, the UK, etc., are more adept at prohibit opinions freely expressed to restrict the actions of the Government.
The war which is currently taking place in Iraq is probably the best evidence.
Let's leave aside the immorality of the war, and God knows how it is immoral! I wish to draw attention to this growing capacity and on the tendency of democracies to "deal" with (and therefore neutralize) public opinion.
They have adopted the strategy of.
When democracies mature, they become more than ever paid in the management of the opinion and, in most cases, in the shaping of opinion.
At each Hans Blix commented on the UN inspections that he headed in Iraq, members of the Bush administration paraphrasaient what Blix said.
This paraphrase changed subtly comments from Blix to support the arguments of America for war.
Repeating comments retouched, the Bush administration hoped that public opinion would agree as as the war.
It can be difficult to topple a totalitarian regime and to hold elections, but the hardest task is to transform the votes of electors in a true democracy.
For individuals accustomed to living in a totalitarian State, it is not easy to learn the meaning of the term 'participation'.
Where the popular belief that democracies, like wine, improve with age.
Although this may be true, maturity has its own disadvantage.
While the citizens of a democracy continuously learn to participate, democratic Governments continuously learn to get their way despite the participation.
There is no denying that civic participation too often serves only to legitimize false - semblants.
We must admit and confront this problem to prevent established democracies from atrophying and to help the new democracies to become more efficient.
Because it is not only morally wrong to let nations and communities feel marginalized and without a voice; It is the best path to frustration, rage and terrorism.
Redistribution of governance in Asia.
Governance (how decisions affecting the public interest are taken) has become a key factor to determine the pace of development of a country. A successful governance brings resolved changes.
Failures are punished by unease, discontent and stagnation.
April 18 will be held in Bangkok a conference to examine the prospects for improvement of governance in Asia.
Asian policy-makers of today face a very different environment than their predecessors fifty years earlier.
The Asian population has more than doubled since 1950, mainly in the poorest countries.
The country's political system was adapted for small populations, rural and stable.
Today, these companies need to also manage extended urban centres as talent and multiple requests on the part of urban populations.
The global economy has also changed dramatically.
The increase in the flow of goods, capital and knowledge around the world causes that foreign organizations and individuals have more influence, even more complicating the task of the national Governments concerned about the internal management of their own nations.
Thus, international institutions such as the WTO have changed frames of reference within which economic decisions are made.
Changes in local economies are also radical.
In parts of Asia, living standards soared.
Foreign investment to the regions or even external altered the structure of domestic economies.
Older models of economic growth, however, such as the orientation of exports or selective use of import restrictions that produced satisfactory results in the last century East Asia, are less well adapted to the new international exchange laws.
Therefore, create new rules of the game.
In most Asian countries, the official rules should be simplified and applied more fairly.
An approach "back to basics" is essential in three interrelated areas in which national Governments must resume the direction: reduction of corruption, the strengthening of property rights and the consistent application of legal principles.
There are few countries that can score points in these areas.
The close links between the world of business and Governments have accused of being responsible for the financial crises that hit Asia South - East in 1997.
In some regions of South Asia, violent conflict and the power of vested interests have jeopardized legal principles.
The result of such failures is that elites thrive while the mass suffering.
A clear structure of formal rules remains the best antidote to these failures because they strengthen informal habits which relied on both companies.
Affairs will lead not to the tribunal but in meetings where trust and reputation are essential elements.
As demonstrated by Robert Putnam, social theorist, "social capital" (networks, norms and social trust that facilitate cooperation and coordination for the benefit of all) is as much a parameter as a result of economic growth.
Confer the power to so many members of civil society as possible is to instill more surely very specific purposes in the efforts to advance the nations.
The Government, the private sector and civil society all have a role to play in strengthening social capital.
Interactions successful between these sectors can simply not be desired without other input but it is essential that the role of each is clearly defined.
Many Asian Governments recognize the need to redefine their role more clearly.
Following the 1997 crisis, Governments withdrew a little more markets, recognizing as well the limits of their ability to act and how it is important to allow private entrepreneurship to develop.
However, Governments have a role to play in the promotion of an enabling environment within which markets can operate.
Control regulation and enforcement are two important but different ways of work (say through mixed partnerships between the public sector and the private sector) which are increasingly detained in good number of innovative Asian economies.
The valuable role of civil society in the expression of community opinions that Governments cannot reach is also recognized, but its relationship to the Government and the business world is more often characterized by conflict than cooperation.
The role of the private sector in decision making must also often be clarified: where businesses are too influential over Governments, needs to operate profitably can lead them towards policies favoring the elites rather than the masses.
The metaphor of the game (with its rules and its participants) leads some to think in terms of international competition.
This is not very healthy insofar as our interdependent world is not a sum game void where a nation gains represent the losses of another.
In fact, the nations are not involved in a competition against each other as is the case for companies.
Trade represent a set to positive-sum where all countries benefit from the exploitation of their areas of comparative advantage.
Good governance can enhance this positive sum game and ensure that businesses and individuals from these countries participate in the profits.
It is somehow valid to think of Governments as to entities competing (providing a better service to their people than other Governments).
Therefore, what confers an important role in international comparisons of the systems.
In this spirit, the conference of the UNCTAD - UNDP this month - ci ("governance in Asia: Underpinning Competitiveness in a Global Economy", governance in Asia: strengthening competitiveness in the world economy), will bring together policy-makers from across Asia to discuss the challenges facing the governance in Asia.
The role of the Government (the only actor to have the legitimacy of a popular mandate) is fundamentally important in the direction of a nation going forward.
The private sector and civil society are, of course, more and more often important partners for Governments.
The functioning of the relationship between these participants will deeply influence the future of development in Asia.
The 18th Brumaire of Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Replacing a Governor whom they re-elected only a year earlier by Arnold Schwarzenegger must have made to Californian voters an enormous pleasure, although only tinged with guilt.
Some members of the opposition in Germany would do the same with Chancellor Gerhard SchrÃ¶der, although they have not (yet!
) Found the movie star to replace him.
Several other European Governments have also been experiencing a certain unpopularity shortly after their election.
This is true also in non-European countries, as for example the recently acclaimed Brazilian president, Luis Inacio "Lula" da Silva, not to mention president South - Korean to Roh Moo - hyun, the latter having requested a referendum to stop the decline in its popularity.
It seems that nowadays, the effects of electoral success fade rapidly.
Each country must - it therefore adopt a callback procedure to preserve the legitimacy of Governments?
Absolutely not.
Democracy, to borrow the words of the philosopher Karl Popper, is defined by the ability to exclude those who are in power without violence; It is then, according to this definition, a method by trial and error.
But leaders must have the chance to govern.
Indeed, they must have a chance to make mistakes as long as their decisions do not affect the foundations of the democratic order him - even.
By trial and error method involves the possibility of being wrong before trying again.
The first mistake of Californian voters door on "the lure of the immediate", which is far from being surprising in a State where instant gratification is self - saying a fundamental value.
But this desire seems sometimes overwhelming in democracies post - modern in all countries of the world.
Indeed, democracy of today adopted a pop culture fads that disappear as quickly as they came. the pop group to the hysterical fans of today will be forgotten tomorrow and there are many others who are waiting in the wings.
In politics, this situation can be dangerous because it encourages the rapid decisions, whatever their importance, according to popular opinion momentarily prevailing.
The call for an increased number of referendums reflects and kindles this trend.
Referendums are, for the most part, snapshots.
Switzerland, with its generally slower pace and its in-depth before the elections, political debates are probably the only exception to this rule.
As a general rule, referendums are used to measure the popularity of political leaders at any time, regardless of the issue at stake.
If and when the Great - Britain will decide on the adoption of the euro, it is more than likely that the result of this vote will teach us all kinds of things about Tony Blair and the European Union, but little about the merits of the common currency.
Thus, the arguments in favour of a representative Government remain significant.
Democracy is to govern by organizing debates, taking important decisions after extensive discussions which, at least in the large countries, must be carried out within a Parliament by elected representatives.
Sometimes parliaments wish to act quickly, and they may be obliged to do so, but as a general rule, they are taking enough time to examine issues in detail.
Parliaments talk before forming conclusions, from which their name.
Take the case of Germany, countries in which some leaders of the Christian Democrats of the opposition group burned with envy of nullifying the SchrÃ¶der Government.
Clearly, the proposed reforms and partly already enacted by the Government are unpopular and there is virtually no doubt that a year after his re-election, the coalition of Social Democrats and Greens has only very little chance of convincing to the polls.
But who can know what the voters will think in three years, when the Government's mandate will end?
Until the next election, the voters, in hindsight, might realize that there was no real alternative to the policies of SchrÃ¶der and it could even be that the beneficial effects expected from these painful reforms become them apparent from here there.
Leaders need time to take and apply that popular and unpopular decisions.
They need courage to lead often precarious parliamentary majorities on the way of a popularity that has its ups and downs.
This is the reason why they are obliged to take the most painful measures during their first year in office for then is radoucir to the approach of the next election.
Precarious partnership of Prime Minister Tony Blair and Finance Minister Gordon Brown illustrates perfectly this type of tactic.
Leaders who never risk their popularity are not worthy of their position.
California has thus shown the bad example and Californians will probably have to pay a high price for their mistake.
It does will however probably not as high as that paid by the France a century and a half ago, when Louis Napoleon, elected by universal suffrage, is transformed through an excessively popular referendum, Napoleon III, this vote being the last in France until the end of the Second Empire.
Californians, of course, are not deprived of the right to vote, but their stubbornness may cause an unpredictable and irresponsible policy of State form.
It is certain that democracy implies a limited time duration during which the powerful of this world must be able to exercise their power without challenge.
An effective democracy should give them enough time to win membership of the elected representatives to legislate and to implement their programme.
These two imperatives are inherently contradictory, but a representative parliamentary democracy is still the best way to ensure a balance between the two.
Any other plan would be as stable as the ten best pop songs of this week.
Herbert Hoover and the stability pact.
In mid - July, the great- and Finance Ministers of the countries members of the European Monetary Union (EMU) gathered to discuss the economic situation in the euro zone.
They have pondered the the more recent economic forecasts, which project an annual growth of GDP in the euro area this year sadly anemic level of 0.7 per cent.
Then, with the exception of one Minister, they all decided that their economy was still suffering a bit of this infamy or worse still.
They reaffirmed their commitment to the stability and growth pact which requires countries of the eurozone increases of taxes and public spending cuts, highlighting the pressure on their economies.
This Pact is already pushing the Germany in the recession, the Italian Government is struggling to revise its growth forecasts fast enough to not be exceed by a faulty production index.
However, it seems not enough to force officials to reconsider their priorities.
Some finance ministers Europeans still consider the Stability Pact as the 'cornerstone' of EMU.
Others speak of the importance of obeying the "rule of the game".
Others still believe that recovery should take place "in the spirit of the Covenant", even if it remains essential to restore economic growth.
Seen across the Atlantic, all these reasons seem extremely strange.
The last time that the U.S. Government has tried to ensure a budget balanced despite the recession, it was sixty-ten years ago, under the Presidency of Herbert Hoover at the beginning of the great depression.
Since a wide consensus established States--United on the cycles of economic depression that require the use of budget deficits to relieve suffering, stimulate demand and precipitate the resumption.
Economists call these cycles of tax boosts "automatic stabilisers".
When household incomes fall, it is similarly public sector revenues.
Tax cuts can increase disposable income.
But, mainly, when household incomes are falling, the Government's social spending increase, triggering the resumption of demand, production, investment and employment.
Lower taxes and increase spending widen the deficit of the budget but healthy and effective way.
On the American side of the Atlantic, the usefulness of these fiscal stabilizers is not questioned.
On the contrary, every threat of recession, political debate revolves around their reinforcement by impulses.
Not more than that is a question of fiscal discipline.
Whenever proposals for amendment of the Constitution to balance the budget have surfaced, the proposals have traditionally offered derogations not only in case of war, but also in the event of recession.
We know the origins of the stability and Growth Pact.
The countries of Northern Europe, particularly Germany and countries - down to are always liked to maintain a low ratio between debt and GDP and interest rates relatively low.
When these countries have found that the countries of southern Europe, the Italy and Greece in particular, usually had a high debt ratio and their GDP and relatively high nominal interest rates by virtue of their visible tolerance for inflation.
The countries of Northern Europe feared that the deficits of the South might ultimately create pressure on the partial monetization of their debt through inflation of the euro, or more specifically, their leaders feared that frightened for the same reasons investors demand higher interest rates.
The stability and Growth Pact was designed to maintain the debt of the countries of the South of Europe at low levels, now so interest rates low enough to reassure investors on the fact that the national debt would be never left upward point of generating serious inflationary pressure.
Yet when considering the economic problems of the eurozone today, threat of high long-term nominal interest rates is certainly not part of the ten main concerns of investors.
At worst, investors do not fear that a high debt push Governments to slow inflation by printing money.
The European Union's problems come from a stagnant production index, high structural unemployment, weak growth in productivity, a common agricultural policy unnecessary and unjust and the prediction of the structural adjustments for the expansion of the European Union it - even.
From a certain point of view, it is good that the eurozone finance ministers are prepared to maintain their national debt at the lowest long term: it is the sign that the victories won in the 1970s inflation will not be purely and simply ignored.
But it is dangerous to fixate on the past.
There is no safer road towards economic disaster than the historical blinders.
As in testify Herbert Hoover, when one considers that the economic problems of the previous generation, might not see the dangers that lie directly beneath our eyes.
The ghosts of Economics past.
In the famous novel by Charles Dickens, "A Christmas Carol" ("a singing Christmas"), soulless businessman Ebeneezer Scrooge is tormented by the spirit of Christmas past.
Today, economists are similarly troubled by unwanted ghosts, while they reflect on the recurrence of economic ills thought dead and buried for a long time.
Whether it's Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley or Paul Krugman of Princeton, the Governors of the US Federal Reserve or anyone in Japan, economists around the world worried about deflation.
Their concerns date back wire of economic thought from fifty years ago, where economists had discovered that the only thing to do against deflation was to avoid it like the plague!
In 1933, Irving Fisher - the predecessor of Milton Friedman's monetarist school - American announced that Governments must prevent great depressions by avoiding deflation.
Deflation - the steady and continuous price decline - encouraged the business and consumers to reduce their spending and hoard their cash.
This reduces the ability of businesses and banks to repay their debts and can trigger a series of huge bankruptcy destroying confidence in the financial system, which then feeds the fear and hoarding.
Such incentives to hoard rather than spend maintain demand at its lowest and always downward while unemployment grows and increases over a very long period that even politicians and economists who defend hard policies of - let cannot accept.
Thus, only remaining the Keynesian solution: use monetary policies (lower interest rates) and fiscal (inflation of public expenditure and tax reduction) to maintain the economy away from the abyss that makes possible deflation.
However, if this question was settled more than fifty years earlier, why is back - she haunt us?
Why it is a threat that worries both the Japan today and deserves there is concern to States - United?
At the end of the 1940s, those rational to the creation of an international economic order after - war that tried to create an international monetary system that (a) would stabilize enough exchange rates so that producers and consumers escape the dangers of excessive and irrational exchange rate fluctuations (b) would allow nations to set up their own macroeconomic policies and (c) prevent the catastrophic panics affecting not only banks and the individuals, but also whole nations that produced the destructive international financial crisis of the Great Depression.
This results in the creation of the system Bretton - Wood, where Exchange rates are fixed but flexible, which became over the years the floating system of the 1980s.
Then came the 1990s.
Suddenly, incredibly destructive financial crisis reappeared following the popular panic in Mexico, in Thailand, in Korea, in the Brazil, etc., and looked to the financial panic of 1873 or the Austrian crisis of the Creditanstalt in 1931.
The argentine crisis from the end of the year 2001 looked like an extraordinary to the argentine crisis of the Baring Brothers in 1890 - if politicians and international bankers seemed to have a much better idea what should be done to minimize the damage that they seem to have today.
Thus, if those who built the international monetary system after - war worked to put in place of guard - crazy to protect us from the dangers of international financial crises created by the panics popular, why this kind of crisis is reborn - he today?
The truth is that economic policies juggle a range of possible disasters, trucking who appears most threatening for the one who seems the most distant.
States-United, the Government Bush remains skeptical about the stimulating monetary policy authority and wants to maintain from big budget deficits to reduce unemployment, hoping that the future dangers that involve persistent deficits - weakened investment, slow growth, loss of confidence, uncontrollable inflation and exchange-rate depreciation can be skillfully manipulated or not to reveal until after the departure of the Bush Presidency team.
In Europe, the European Central Bank believes that the danger of an uncontrolled inflation following a loss of confidence of the public in its commitment to a low inflation outweighs the costs of unemployment, which remains too high.
In developing countries, the capital controls to prevent financial crises is seen as an obstacle preventing the attraction of the capital necessary to industrialization, and as a potential source of corruption since financial flows pass in one way or another into the hands of the nephew by marriage of vice - Minister of finance.
Exchange rates flexible designed to allow to indicate confidence declines in the currency markets also put exporters in a difficult competitive situation compared with producers of foreign countries whose prices are manhandled by little predictable exchange rates.
Even the substitution of imports, today sharply criticized policies were adopted by developing countries for good (and bad) reasons: the protectionist closure of the markets of the countries developed during the Great Depression had disastrous consequences on the economies of developing countries.
The ghosts of Economics past we return because the lessons of the present are always saturated.
Politicians and policy makers highlight their economic approach as "the sole Doctrine".
But they do, in fact, returned to manage the most important problems of the moment at the expense of the disappearance of institutions and policies put in place by their predecessors to control problems that they perceived as most urgent.
Ebeneezer Scrooge nocturnal visitors were able to convince him that he was wrong and to open their eyes to mistakes.
Hope that economists of today will also take the lesson of their unwanted ghosts.
In the shade of deutsch mark.
Overcome the Irish cocktail.
Justification for humanitarian intervention.
I visited the former Soviet republics of Central Asia in 1998 to take part in the talks concerning the democratic development that took place (or that should have taken place) in those newly independent countries.
My hosts were former Communist leaders who now assumed the role of elected presidents more or less democratically.
Each of them spoke without constraints of institutions, democratic procedures and the respect for the law.
But the human rights were a matter entirely aside.
I submitted in each country a list of political prisoners, asking what was their fate.
In one country, the president immediately decided to release a man accused of plotting a coup.
But even this apparent success has proved to be morally ambiguous.
The president had not taken a political decision: he gave a personal favor.
I had received a gift in him - even just another demonstration of the arbitrary exercise of the power of the president, and not proof of respect for moral principles.
In one country, I spoke with a leader of the Islamic fundamentalist opposition, which was launched in a long civil war against the Government.
This man was president of the "Committee of national reconciliation".
Guards armed to the teeth surrounded him, while it strongly supported the concept of democratization.
Indeed, he considered this notion as the surest path to power because the vast majority of the population thought exactly like him.
Democracy, insinuated - he more disturbingly, it would "eliminate" (it does not lingered on the exact meaning of this term) the population opposed to his ideas.
In democracies deprived of Democrats, it is even more complicated to discuss "human rights" as procedural formalities because these rights are not considered as 'rights' in the legal sense, but simply as bouts of conscience or as gifts to exchange for another valuable asset.
This distinction is particularly important because it draws attention to the limited effectiveness of the formal legal standards as a means of promotion of human rights.
This gap between the human rights and the behavior of the leaders has resulted in the most important change in the conduct of International Affairs of our time: the advent of 'humanitarian intervention'.
This change originally occurred outside established international institutions and the UN system by pulling its origin from the french Group doctors without borders, which considered that human rights were more important than national sovereignty value.
MÃ©decins sans FrontiÃ¨res has introduced the concept of the "right to intervene" in humanitarian disasters by circumventing the restrictions of traditional international law.
The international system has also quickly adopted (and transformed) this notion and several humanitarian interventions.
The intervention of NATO in Kosovo is a precedent which the US Secretary of State Colin Powell is used to justify the war with the Iraq.
But, so convincingly that the cause of humanitarian military intervention, such actions must be undertaken under the aegis of the UN Charter.
After all, the promotion of respect for human rights has been the guiding principle of the establishment of the United Nations.
His work in this area has been proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of the rights of man of 1948 and in the Helsinki agreements of 1975, that gave the human rights legal supremacy over the sovereignty of individual States.
There is however a blatant contradiction between the universality and the supremacy of human rights and the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States, which are also an integral part of the documents of the United Nations.
One of the methods to overcome this contradiction is to introduce a new chapter dedicated to human rights in the Charter of the United Nations and to reformulate chapter IV, which concerns the use of force in international relations.
Furthermore, the principle of sovereignty must be redefined in him - even.
The world needs a system of legal orders (bilateral and multilateral agreements, appropriate control and monitoring institutions) to regulate the use of force for humanitarian reasons.
Legal restrictions on humanitarian intervention are necessary because dictators use it too often to justify a criminal aggression.
Adolf Hitler developed his strategy when he dismantled Czechoslovakia, self - saying to defend the Germans of the Sudetenland, and later when he invaded my homeland, the Poland.
As Milosevic demonstrated again in the 1990s, when he claimed to defend the Serbs of Croatia and Bosnia innocent, justify military intervention solely on the basis of moral principles leaves too much scope to distort these principles and abuse.
This is the reason why the debate on the reform of the Security Council must focus not on change of its composition, but on his mission.
The Council must be made explicitly responsible for the "human security" and its protection, in addition to his current role of more traditional notions of international security backup.
The principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of a State has never been absolute and globalization confronts this principle with a radical challenge.
The term "international relations" assumes a Westphalian of commitments among sovereign nations order, which replaced the medieval order of communities defined by personal allegiance to a King.
But the Westphalian order is now in decline, and the meaning of State borders.
In this broad and uncertain context, the need to regulate humanitarian military intervention threat.
What is America?
When the leaders of the richest nations of the world gather in Evian, France, an unanswered question will dominate the front of the stage: what does America in the world?
It may be useful at this stage to stress the principles and ideas that guide American foreign policy.
First of all, the inconsistency is not a vice.
Indeed, in foreign policy, inconsistency is often a virtue.
I speak not of principles, but of policy.
States - United do not observe an approach "one size for all" to the world.
What happened in Iraq should not be overâinterpreted as a rigid model of American policy towards the countries that rely on weapons of mass destruction, which support terrorism or deny freedom to their citizens.
In Iraq, States - United have used force last recourse against a country with a heavy past attacks, and after a strong international consensus developed on the actions that should undertake the Iraq.
Different policies tailored to local, regional and international realities should be implemented to respond to the challenges posed by North Korea, the Iran, the Syria and many other countries.
U.S. military forces are an essential element of the major part of the actions taken by States - United internationally.
But defence policy is only one only the components of foreign policy.
All threats against America's national interests cannot be resolved by military force.
As the saying, for people who have only a hammer, all problems are in the form of nail.
The success in foreign policy, as in carpentry, must rely on the tools appropriate to the task.
Partnership with other countries plays a vital role at this stage.
Despite all the American power, it has not - much as States - United can accomplish in the world they could not better succeed with the active participation of others (Governments, international organizations or non-governmental organizations).
The partnership facilitates the discovery of solutions to problems which oppose purely national responses and implies the sharing of expenses.
America relies on partnerships in the global war against terrorism. Foreign Governments provide intelligence and law enforcement; trading partners ensure the security of shipping containers; private financial institutions follow the trace transfers of funds that support terrorist networks.
To the - beyond partnerships, international institutions prove invaluable assistance, provided that they be organized efficiently, have realistic mandates and that their members are committed to standards and common objectives.
These institutions can and often do advance the national interests of States - United.
Indeed, it would be rather difficult to achieve the critical dimensions of American foreign policy (trade to non-proliferation to policies on the environment) without these interests.
A typical example is the World Trade Organization.
It provides a forum for negotiation of the new trade liberalization agreements, seeking remedies against protectionist and discriminatory policies and resolves conflicts with trading partners.
But the States - United must also ensure that existing institutions are adapted to current realities.
NATO, for example, evolved from an alliance of cold war focused only on Europe an organisation adapted to meet current security challenges regardless of the place where they arise, as in Afghanistan and may be in Iraq.
Multilateralism is more successful when it is based on a real convergence of interests and values.
The United Nations and other global structures can sometimes be best placed to address the objectives of foreign policy of States - United.
When the United Nations or other organizations are unwilling or powerless to oppose sinister threats, America reserves the right to act in alliances less inclusive or of flexible coalitions.
This flexibility is an asset of first importance due to the nature of the challenges that are looming on the horizon.
We ignore the States that will drift at our peril because anarchy creates an environment conducive to extremist ideologies and can even offer a refuge to terrorists, criminals and drug traffickers.
One of our most urgent tasks at present is to prevent the implosion of weak States.
Another is on assisting countries which have sunk in the violence to help slowly recover.
One of the impulses that govern the international commitment to America (and one of the main sources of its global power) was his desire to make the world better.
Any American foreign policy must combine interests and values because the American public always insists that US national objectives are linked to national ideals.
The attractiveness of American leadership abroad rests partly on the appeal of political institutions, society and American culture, as well as on his enthusiasm to defend human rights and democracy.
At the same time, our efforts to promote democracy worldwide serve American interests through the recognition of objective that democracies settle their disputes peacefully.
Today's world presents no irreconcilable conflict between the main concentrations of the world power: Europe, the Russia, China, the Japan and States - United.
This compliance interest and agree on the rules of international order offers a very promising basis for the management of the common challenges that we all face.
Our first objective must be to create a world in which Governments, organizations and peoples will accept arrangements that will enable them to realize their shared interests and which reflect fundamental universal values.
We all have an interest in living in a world in which the force is used only as a last resort, where terrorism is considered as unacceptable, the weapons of mass destruction do not spread and are not used, the free - exchange becomes the norm, citizens may taste freedoms, democratic values triumph and Bill replaces the firearms.
Create an if-integrated world may seem optimistic, even idealistic, but seldom naive.
The road to the double helix, the structure of DNA.
Fifty years earlier, on April 25, 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick published a short letter in the Science magazine.
The second major step took place a few months later, when Max Perutz discovered a technique to determine the structures of large molecules like Myoglobin and hemoglobin.
Since then, structural analysis by x-ray of protein molecules allowed us to understand the chemistry of biological reactions.
These two discoveries (the structure of DNA and the protein structure) were in the Cambridge University Cavendish laboratory.
So why these two commemorative stones of the revolution of biology and medicine that have dominated science in the second half of the 20.
Large capitals 1953 discoveries were based on experimental physics as it was practiced in Cambridge since the end of the 19th century.
This legacy has shaped the intellectual environment in which formed the team father - son of William and Lawrence Bragg and in which Lawrence Bragg, first as student and then as a student researcher, developed in 1912 the ideas leading to the structural analysis by x-ray.
Although Max von Laue, Walter Friedrich and Paul Knipping had discovered the diffraction of x-rays by crystals, it was Lawrence Bragg who discovered the way to exploit this discovery scientifically.
Reflection by the "Bragg planes", sheets of atoms can diffract x-rays at specific angles determined by the separation between the leaves, allowed the Bragg to calculate the exact disposition of sodium and chloride atoms in a crystal of salt.
William Bragg graduated in mathematics in Cambridge in 1884 and became Professor of Physics in Adelaide, Australia.
In 1909, he returned to England to take a Chair at Leeds, while continuing his work on the nature of the x-ray...
He became Director of the Royal Institution in London in 1923, where he attracted some young scientists unparalleled interested in x-ray...
Among them were two new graduates from Cambridge, William Astbury and John Desmond Bernal, who became interested in the problem of protein structure, Astbury the request of Bragg to provide x-ray diagrams of wool and silk.
Bernal returned to Cambridge as Professor of structural crystallography in 1927 and was promoted to the position of assistant to the Director of research in crystallography in 1923, at the time a Sub - Department of the Cavendish laboratory.
Bernal was first interested in the atomic structure of crystals, metals and minerals, and hormones and sterols, and certain amino acids, the components of proteins.
Between - time Astbury alla settle to Leeds in 1928, where he also began to work on the amino acids and proteins.
In describing his unsuccessful attempts to obtain x-ray diffraction diagrams orderly from crystals of the protein pepsin, he wondered whether Bernal could help him to obtain crystals of other proteins.
A friend of Bernal, Glenn Millikan, come visit a lab in Uppsala, Sweden, where researchers had succeeded in obtaining large pepsin crystals, reported some of these crystals, always in their mother liquor, in Cambridge.
Bernal and Dorothy Crowfoot (Hodgkin after her marriage) obtained patterns of dry crystals, as Astbury, with similarly disappointing results.
But when Bernal observed the crystals in a light microscope, it noted that when the large amount of water contained in the network of the crystals evaporated, the order of the crystals was upset.
They repeated the x-ray experiment, but with the Crystal surrounded by his mother liquor and sealed in a glass capillary, obtaining patterns including several crystalline reflections.
The results of this first moment of definition in protein crystallography were published as a letter in the magazine.
Max Perutz, a degree in chemistry in Vienna, joined Cambridge in 1935 to work as student with Bernal.
The following year, he received some excellent hemoglobin crystals and soon produced the best x-ray diffraction diagrams to date.
But the observable diffraction (the intensities and the positions of the individual reflections) pattern represents only half of the required data to deduce the structure of the object of diffraction.
In mathematical terms, this scheme gives the amplitude, but not the phases (namely, the stages of an oscillatory motion) without which it is impossible to determine the Atomic positions.
With more simple structures consisting of a number smaller atoms, chemistry could provide essential information on Atomic arrangements and a solution could be found by trial and error.
But proteins, which contain thousands of atoms, were much too complicated to make this solution work.
Thus, despite the impressive amount excellent data collected, the solution remained cruelly out of reach.
But faith in obtaining detailed information about protein structure from x-ray patterns remained, but only if this information could be discovered.
It was therefore normal that where chemistry had failed, physics, and its first lab, showing the way, a road taken by Watson and Crick in the breakthrough epic that we celebrate this month - ci.
Separate worlds.
Macroeconomic policies, financial globalization and the evolution of the labour market institutions have exacerbated inequality in recent years, not only at the level of income and wealth, but also in terms of access to education, health, the social protection, as well that with regard to political participation and influence.
Even in countries experiencing rapid economic growth any one set of factors, exacerbated by extraordinary demographic changes, has resulted in the transmission of inequality of knowledge, social responsibilities and opportunities from one generation to another.
As shown by the United Nations with the report on the world social situation 2005: the crisis of inequality, few countries, rich or poor, have proved immune to the global trend of the mounted inequalities or its impact on education, health and welfare social.
Of course, there is no simple causal relationship linking poverty and inequality to violence.
But inequality and a sense of deprivation contributes to resentment and social instability and threaten security.
Excluded and having only dark future prospects, young people, in particular, often experience a certain anomie and take refuge in anti-social and even violent behaviour.
Any more than there are simple explanation on the causes of poverty.
It is clear, however, that poverty has various and complex conditions, and that its improvement requires a multidimensional approach.
It is difficult to imagine, for example, how "return poverty in the dustbin of history" (Make Poverty History) without also generate work, educational opportunities and health for all.
It is certain that the world has witnessed the some progress in several areas in recent decades.
Access to education for girls has improved and some differences due to the gap between the sexes has been reduced.
Despite AIDS and the resurgence of malaria and tuberculosis, life expectancy has increased almost everywhere in the world thanks to the improvement of public health systems.
Overall, however, the gap of inequality remains deep and in some cases it is even expanding.
The determining the most important regarding inequality income today remains the inequality of wealth, with the increasing concentration of ownership of the property last years as lead to greater inequality of income in most countries.
Meanwhile, rampant unemployment, qualifications and productivity gap is digging, as well as the "-formalization" and the "-methodology" which hit the labour markets have exacerbated income inequalities worldwide, the number of 'working poor' and the impact of the "growth in the number of unemployed" increased.
More than stabilization and structural adjustment programmes imposed since the 1980s, have actually fulfilled their promises of higher economic growth.
Growth almost everywhere in the world over the past twenty-five years has been lower than during the twenty - five previous years, despite the meteoric growth in East Asia, the India and some other countries.
Such growth differences suggest that global inequalities in all have can - not be increased unequivocally.
But inequalities at the national level have worsened in most countries in recent years, in large part due to economic liberalization as well at the national level to the international level.
Indeed, in many parts of the world, this kind of economic reforms has actually undermined the growth rate as well as the initiator role of Governments, while also increasing inequalities in General.
The few exceptions are usually due to interventions measured or persistent of some Governments.
But these are exceptions: the cumulative impact of these reforms over the past 25 years has produced greater inequality in most developed countries and developing, with the increase in unemployment, most large disparities of income, reduction of social protections and the degradation of the environment.
The liberalisation of the international financial sector, for example, has undermined the use of more inclusive and better targeted development grants to promote economic activities.
In addition, contrary to the promises of its proponents, financial liberalization has actually resulted in movements of net capital from those who had the least to those who had the most in the long term, while increasing financial volatility and weakening economic activity.
Meanwhile, negotiations on the liberalisation of trade appeared to ignore historical trends.
The terms of trade of developing countries have deteriorated: commodity prices have declined compared to manufactured goods, as the prices of the tropical agricultural products compared to the prices of agricultural products of temperate countries, and prices of generic products have fallen as a result of production protected by the laws on intellectual property.
As such, the liberalisation of trade in manufactured goods resulted in de-industrialization and a surge of unemployment in most regions of the world, as demonstrated in the case of textiles this year.
And, while agricultural trade liberalization could improve revenues in the export of some poor countries, the main beneficiaries will be other than the richest agricultural exporters.
Countries that import currently subsidized products will suffer.
"Disengagement of the State" at which a large part of the world developed recently generally involved the reduction of the role of the State, particularly in his ability to lead and support the development, as well as its social interventions in the areas of education, health, housing and public services.
Economic liberalization implemented in many countries over the past 25 years was, from the outset, a questionable policy and its consequences have become completely obvious.
If the world does not focus on economic policies able to address the negative impact of economic inequality on growth and poverty reduction, the poor and the privileged will continue to live in separate worlds.
Do not follow the Federal Reserve.
The Federal Reserve of the United States faces a dilemma, because it needs to continue raising interest rates an economy devastated by Hurricane Katrina.
The inability of the Reserve raising interest rates earlier thus gives a European lesson to the Central Bank: after a prolonged period of monetary stability at rates unusually low, wait too long before raising rates to more normal and appropriate levels has dangerous consequences.
The Reserve took time to begin the process of normalizing rates and it pays now.
The ECB must not make the same mistake, even if we consider that these two central banks operate in different environments and with different constraints.
The front - runners signs of imminent inflation are plenty throughout the euro area.
The growth of the money supply is well above the target for some time levels, indicating excessive liquidity.
Displayed for September, at 2.6%, inflation is higher than the target of 2% of the ECB, as are the recent forecasts for inflation in 2006 (revised and corrected forecasts will be published in early December).
"The period of key wage moderation may - be ending" warns Otmar Issing, the ECB economic Manager, sub - heard that the energy prices are skyrocketing are can - be now supplied via the general level of prices (also known as side effects).
In these circumstances, there is no good reason to wait before raising interest rates.
Most energy prices remain at high levels of today, more great is the probability that the anticipation of inflation will increase and that side effects will be realized.
Any procrastination on the normalisation of interest rates on the part of the ECB could well lead to a nasty bout of inflation.
That would be disastrous for Europe and the economic recovery as the ECB would choice to weigh brutally on the monetary brake pedal.
Nobody has really want.
Better an increase based on 50 points now, thus allowing the economic recovery to continue by controlling inflation, as increased three or four times higher than this figure later.
The old adage "Better safe than sorry" applies particularly in the case of monetary policy.
Judging by the result of the meeting last month of the Board of Governors of the ECB, this "prevention" seems to approach for the euro area economy.
Indeed, the pace of warnings of the ECB on the risk of inflation has accelerated in recent months, and this was only a "Let's be vigilant" became a "Let us be very careful" in September, before transforming into "Necessary Vigilance with respect to high risk live - to - screw the price stability" in October.
The Governing Council takes the risk of being short of adjectives, and credibility, if it does not act soon.
The tone of the comments of the president of the ECB, Jean - Claude Trichet, at the session of questions and answers that took place the press conference following the meeting of October, was especially bellicose.
Mr Trichet seemed to appeal to a pre-emptive approach when he declared: "we must not allow the side effects to materialise".
For the first time, the president of the ECB was ready to admit that the Governing Council had discussed the advantages and disadvantages of an increase in interest rates during their meeting.
Nevertheless, the current rates are described as "always-of-the-news" in October, indicating that the ECB has not yet decided to spend.
It is certain that an unexpected slowdown in economic activity or a strong increase in the value of the euro could push back the inevitable increase in the rate.
What seems yet to emerge clearly is that the ECB has used the October press conference to warn policy-makers, trade unions and the markets that its long period of inactivity on monetary policy comes to an end.
End process is running.
This new delights not everyone.
Political leaders, including Jacques Chirac in France, Silvio Berlusconi in Italy and ECOFIN (the Ministers of Finance of the Member States of the European Union), continue to press for fixed rates, and even the rate still lower.
But it is easy for politicians to act irresponsibly when it comes to monetary policy.
It is not them who are singled out when prices go up, any more than they have to push the inflation genie in the bottle.
Pushing constantly at a drop in rates higher than what the ECB can offer policy makers make the ECB the scapegoat responsible for Europe's poor economic performance.
Europe goes wrong, say - they, not by virtue of their own failure to carry out the necessary structural reforms, but because rates are too high.
At the same time, the ECB has no need to go as far as the Federal Reserve, which has raised its key rates by 25 basis points increments during 12 consecutive meetings, and other increases are expected.
For the ECB, an increase of 50 basis points could be enough at this stage, and the rate could then be put on hold for some time.
The Reserve has waited too long before starting the process of standardization, and as such has been more aggressive in reducing its rate during the phase of decline in the interest rate cycle, it had to be more aggressive in their recovery during the increase phase.
This is not the type of volatile monetary policy Europe wants to, nor that she needs.
The West against the rest of the world?
The Madrid bombings have led at the gates of Europe the scourge of terrorism.
March 11 now represents the European version of September 11, American.
However America and Europe often seem to not see the world with the same eyes: the response of the Spain to terrorist attacks, a threat that affects all democracies, was to elect a Government promising to put an end to the pro-American policy in Iraq.
Should you therefore understand that Europe and the States - United have dramatically different visions?
The apparent division on foreign policy is explained in part by a misunderstanding about the nature of 'Europe'.
The European project represents a realistic response to globalization and its challenges.
It was launched to create "common-law solidarities", promote political stability and consolidating democracy and the social model of Europe.
Having achieved these goals, Europe now wishes to make a positive contribution to the development of the world.
It is not nostalgia to a past glory.
A degree unprecedented solidarity now passes through Europe, occurring for example in the collective grief and compassion for the Spain bloodshed; We must build on this vast potential to create a logic of solidarity in the world.
States - United, also victims of a horrible attack, feel attracted to the world, without going to promote a similar model of cooperation.
In defending their values and their security, the Americans strive rather to defend the world, especially the Western world, dark threats.
The Messianic idealism that has issued the Europe from Nazism and protected Western Europe from Communism is now directed to other enemies.
All the attention on strained transatlantic relations, it is easy to forget that our concerns meet often.
On such issues as terrorism, proliferation of weapons, Iran, Afghanistan (countries in which we jointly train the future army of the country) and Africa (where French and American support initiatives have recently allowed to stabilize CÃ´te d'Ivoire and Congo), Europe and the States - us speak with one voice.
But on some issues, such as the war in Iraq, Europeans are not ready to follow America to the fishing expedition.
The world, and Europe in particular, feel the fascination and admiration for the States - United.
But today, we must set aside any sense of fascination and gratitude and awareness the pursuit of European integration is in the interests of the States - United, who supported him for 50 years.
In today's world, there is enough to do for two to achieve stability and security, and to promote common values.
In particular, the "" franco - German motor of Europe must not be considered as a potential for the States rival - United.
The France and the Germany do not form an axis aspiring to become a kind of alternative leadership to States - United.
The two countries are rather a laboratory needed for the internal functioning of the EU.
Anyone who thinks that we produce a European rival to America did not properly facts.
Indeed, the France and the Germany do not agree of course.
Many points separate them: enlargement of the EU, agriculture and the domestic market.
So it is not the.
All of this is that I do not believe in the imminence of a lasting rupture.
The majority of Americans still see in Europe a partner pursuing largely the same objectives in the world.
The majority of Europeans see a solid friend in America.
We are all allies of the States - United; our growth strategy and our contribution to the global stability depend on the irreplaceable nature of our relations with America.
This is the reason why States - United must encourage the development of a common European defence and security policy which simply represents the burden sharing that America imposed on Europe for decades.
We need to forge European military capabilities more important to put in place a mechanism allowing us to stand shoulder to shoulder in an efficient manner when terrorism or other disasters hit one of our democracies, as it has happened.
But we also need to create an autonomous European military planning capacity because the EU might need to conduct its own operations, may be because NATO is reluctant to this subject.
We, the French, are opposed to the establishment of a "two-speed" Europe.
But we want a structured cooperation (c'est - Ã  - say that some European States may lead to the establishment of a defence capability) because we are not prepared to let the more careful and more hesitant of us repeat the tragedy of the Balkans in the 1990s, when Europeans could not act while the Americans did (for a while).
The creation of such a capability would make the EU a more effective transatlantic partner.
Thus, it is difficult for Europeans to understand why plans for closer European integration are considered anti - Americans.
The only way to remove these fears is to establish a closer and more frequent dialogue.
On matters of defence and security, the security of the EU doctrine offers a great opportunity to consolidate our common concerns: terrorism and non-proliferation, but also the need to ensure sustainable development in all regions of the world.
Europe and the States - United must pursue their goals of cooperation while ensuring that this cooperation never becomes an alliance of "the West against the rest of the world".
Some Western countries have attempted to create a "clash of civilizations" based on our troubled times.
Our task is to find a way to draw us together without provided us up against a particular country.
The India is - it lends to completely convert its currency?
It is likely that the daring political manifested by the India in its search for peace with Pakistan in order to put an end to their nebulous confrontation of a half - century for the conquest of Kashmir is matched by also bold economic initiatives.
Indeed, the India is progressing slowly towards a truly courageous reform: full international convertibility of the rupee.
This convertibility will affect not only the economic development of the India, but give a lesson to China which ponders convertibility in the years to come.
Since 1991, the India oscillates between the devaluation of the rupee and full convertibility, the Reserve Bank of India (BRI) softener multiple controls Exchange.
Indian residents can now have a foreign currency account and invest in shares of foreign companies, while the Indians non-resident may repatriate legacy / succession capital.
Indian companies listed on foreign stock exchanges may acquire immovable property in foreign countries and the resident enterprises are entitled to prepay external commercial debt to a maximum of $ 100 million.
The limits placed on the accounts of exporters in foreign currency are removed and banks can invest in capital and monetary markets further - sea.
The India is - it ready for full convertibility?
The Government has still behind national economic reforms.
Structural reforms and privatization will are slowed, undermining the confidence of investors.
But this inability to tackle the structural problems may expose the economy to external shocks in the long term.
It would therefore be premature that the India opens its account of capital immediately.
The stability of the exchange rates is the major anchor point when the process of reform of a country has begun.
However, it is unlikely that the convertibility of the capital account has a significant impact on the growth rate of a country.
With the convertibility of the capital account, the rate of exchange of the rupee will be determined more by capital flows by inflation differentials, given that the inflation rate of the India corresponds more or less to the 3% of the OECD average.
Since the India is always loss-making, the rupee could come under pressure following a negative shock.
Although monetary growth rises to more than double the rate of real GDP growth, inflationary risk would be probably low because substantial excess capacity.
Indeed, the 1990s, despite an overall performance increase, have experienced a significant deflation which implies that the overall potential performance of the India develops.
The steps towards full convertibility of the capital account continued in tune with the impressive growth of the India currency reserves.
Indeed, the availability of the India in foreign currency have increased considerably over the last decade.
Following a surplus of account, capital and a gap of 3-4% interest rate currency reserves have reached $ 70.3 billion end of 2002, enough to cover approximately 15 months of imports, compared to only 4 billion dollars in 1990.
Response to balance-of-payments crisis in 1991, the rate of exchange of the rupee was devalued by 20%.
Exporters could exchange 30% of their income to the market conditions.
This method has subsequently been replaced by a system of dual exchange rate, which made the partially convertible rupee (60% of the revenues derived from exports could be converted at the exchange rate of the market and the rest at a rate fixed by the RBI, used by the Government to finance imports of basic necessities such as oilcooking oil, fertilizers and lifesaving drugs).
The dual exchange rate system acted as a tax on export, but it did not survive long, yielding the place to a rate of Exchange Unified at the level of trade.
The full current account convertibility was followed in August 1994.
The political debate then turned to capital account convertibility, strongly encouraged by the IMF and the World Bank.
In May 1997, the Tarapore Committee on Capital Account Convertibility has developed a process of liberalization in three stages by 1999-2000, with an emphasis on fiscal consolidation, an authorized target inflation rate and a sound financial system.
The crisis negotiable instrument of East Asian then put the actions pending and has raised serious questions on the date of the resumption of the actions and the need to continue the convertibility.
The sudden melting of apparently healthy economies recalled bluntly that full convertibility should not arise from strong external liquidity.
After all, the liberalisation of the capital account can lead to instability of the exchange rate and even countries whose currencies availability are important could not prevent a rush on their reserves.
The India must withhold the next lesson: in the event of the national shock or exterior, full convertibility could prove expensive and ephemeral experience.
The fundamental question is whether full convertibility would encourage inflows or net disbursements of capital.
The risk of greater instability for the rupee is aggravated by serious problems, including a deficit amounting to 6% of GDP and the impasse with Pakistan.
The short-term capital outflows, which may occur if one of these two risks worsened, could make even more unstable overall performance.
It is therefore vital that the India increases the inflow of capital over the long term, that the capital account is closed or open.
In this context, it is noteworthy that China, whose capital account is closed, has reserves of foreign currency amounting to $ 286 billion, or four times those of India, although the economy of the China does than double than that of the India.
The full convertibility is not the solution to attract direct investment from abroad (IDE) most important.
China attracted FDI of 52.7 billion dollars in 2002, namely the most important capital receipt in the world.
India needs most important to absorb excess capacity of its economy IDE.
This situation underlines the importance of a successful management of the capital account (control of receipts and capital outflows) for the India after a first not to full convertibility.
But in the short term, the full convertibility of the capital account is not in the interest of the India.
The twilight of the Chancellor?
The resignation of Chancellor Gerhard Schreder of the Democrat party president post of Germany will deeply affect the distribution of forces within the German Government and its slim "red-green" majority in Parliament.
Although it seems premature to talk, as do some in Germany, "twilight of the Chancellor" or qualify the surprising decision of Schreder's "beginning of the end" of his position, it is perfectly appropriate to describe it as a loss of power consistent.
The immediate winner is Franz Mentefering, 64, leader of the parliamentary arena of the SPD, who will succeed Schreder as president of the party.
The two politicians will constitute a tandem, but Schreder will depend on more loyalty of Mentefering that Mentefering will depend on the success of Schreder.
Schreder represents a plate - shape and a political program of the left moderate, similar to the philosophy of the new British Prime Minister Tony Blair's labour party or the centrism of former U.S. president Bill Clinton.
However, Mentefering is more attached to the traditional values of the socio-democratic party (or former Labour Party).
In terms of leadership style, Schreder plays solo, Mentefering team.
In Germany, the Chancellor is in the highest position among the main political actors.
The main source of strength of a German Chancellor is however not in the statutory powers conferred by the constitution, but in real support he brings in his own party.
With one notable exception in the 1950s, none of the two main parties policies (moderately conservative Christian Democrats and Social Democrats) Germany has never managed to get an absolute majority in Parliament.
As a result, German Chancellors usually President of coalition Governments and their real authority is based on the loyalty of the forces of the party they command in these political alliances.
Although the Social Democrats have never really enjoyed Schreder (they do appreciate it certainly not as much as the unforgettable Willy Brandt), they followed him willy-nilly as long as they considered him as the only guarantor of the election after 16 years frustrating (1982-1998) success in the opposition to Helmut Kohl.
But things have changed.
Since late 2002, SchrÃ©der and the SPD found themselves faced with voter approval rates unusually low and this situation is not ready to change the situation.
In 2003 alone, about 40,000 Social Democrats left their party, unprecedented hemorrhage.
If national elections had been held last Sunday, 8 February, a centre-right coalition of the Christian Democrats and the Liberals would have won 57% of the vote, according to Infratest dimap, one of the leading institutes of Germany poll.
With 35% of the vote, the "red-green" coalition Schreder would have run to its loss.
At the beginning of what has been dubbed "super election year" in Germany (14 elections, one at European level, five at the regional level and eight at the local level), this was devastating news for the SPD.
On several occasions, Schreder was extremely stimulated by situations desperate when he found himself back on the wall.
This quality is its greatest strength and it would seem that it now began in the counter - the riskiest offensive that is.
It is based on the following bet: a substantial economic improvement will occur from the second half of 2004 until the next national elections in autumn 2006 and voters will attribute the anticipated recovery in the reforms of the economy, market work and the welfare State, Schreder was spearheaded by his Chancery called "Agenda 2010",.
For a long time, the reformist rhetoric of SchrÃ©der corresponded to its policy.
It was only after his re-election in autumn 2002 that he abandoned his previous populist stance, his answers in the short term and methods neo - corporatists aimed to convince the trade unions and employers ' associations.
Given the more pressing problems of Germany (a population decline that is accelerating, an excessively regulated labour market and a dark and confusing tax system), Schreder reform programme may seem much too timid, but many decreases were seen as extremely cruel by the largest constituency election of the SPD, especially by the powerful trade unions.
But given the economic distress of the Germany, which is expected to worsen further to the demographic problems of the country, the Social Democrats are now condemned to abandon the creation of wealth for the benefit of their redistribution.
The Germany cannot afford to turn the idle or, worse still, to stop the reform process.
In the best cases, Schreder will remain faithful to the "Agenda 2010" philosophy and Mentefering will patiently explain to a reluctant SPD that they must cross the desert before reaching the promised land.
In the worst cases, Schreder will return to populism to win an electoral victory in the short term and Mentefering will confirm this choice in order to avoid to the to Â¢ me democratic socio injured slipping into absolute despair.
The SchrÃ©der tragedy is that its power could further collapse, regardless of the way he chooses.
At the end of the this "super election year", we will know the answer.
The great man Syndrome.
In this era of globalization, are of vast impersonal forces that are supposed to determine the course of events.
The globalization of markets, trade without hindrance, militant islam, the awakening of China: these are the things that historians and strategists usually describe as essential forces that shape our destiny.
Yet, for the most part, we do not see things as well.
Most people will always seek instinctively "great men" for historical figures, men (and women) who seem to forge events through their political vision, their personal charisma and force of their moral positions.
By sheer force of their conviction and their personality, such figures, we believe can advance things, while providing a glimmer of hope in an otherwise detached and impersonal universe.
This aspiration to find men or Angels women in these times of globalization comes from three factors.
As a first step, it is the complexity and vulnerability of our world.
Then, paradoxically, it's our ever-deeper critique of politics and politicians.
Finally, it is the result of our media, obsessed culture what it is you want to put a 'face' on the events.
Faced with the problem of bringing positive change in a national or international environment that seems to defy the power of the 'ordinary' leaders, it turned to new Alexandre to resolve the "n? Gordian knot"and transcend complexity by sheer force of will and dynamism.
Structural reforms in Europe, for example, are considered as impossible to implement unless they were imposed by a reincarnation of Margaret Thatcher.
In the Middle - East, everyone awaits the arrival of a new Anwar Sadat in the Arab world.
Disillusionment vis - Ã  - vis the world of politics and politicians is also an important part of our aspiration to a providential leader.
In France, for example, a little too flattering commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the death of FranÃ§ois Mitterrand mainly reflects the general disillusionment proven against his successor, Jacques Chirac.
Indirect criticism of the present is often a key component of an idealized vision of the past.
We require a "regular" politician, more we are looking for a hero.
The world has become an international stage, the role of the media in the diet of this appetite for providential leaders is essential.
The public requires quick answers to complex problems that, if they remain unresolved, may endanger the planet.
It needs figures with which he can identify with, it can immediately recognize and, above all, that it may grant its confidence.
The emergence of an embryonic "world civil society" exacerbates the requirement of figures universal and charismatic, representatives of hope for global accountability, with some populist accents.
In a world searching for providential leaders, Ariel Sharon case is symbolic and paradoxical, because this universal man remains one of the most controversial figures of recent decades.
He became a character almost revered in his country and Western public opinion considers generally that his political defeat represents a blow which would be fatal to any hope of progress in the region, although it is still hated in many parts of the Arab and Muslim world.
The transformation of Mr Sharon, the traitor become hero in the space of a few years, is a source of fascination for its people, the region and the world, as his ultimate intentions will remain subject to endless discussions among historians of tomorrow and the politicians who claim to his faithful heirs today.
Mr. Sharon he has actually been convinced by demographers that the "greater Israel" that once seemed to be his first aspiration involves effectively the end of the Jewish State or even its exit strategy focused on "Gaza first" meant - it truly "Gaza only"?
For those who support one or the other of these interpretations, Mr. Sharon will forever give the benefit of the doubt.
It has been possible to compare the attack suffered by Mr. Sharon, in terms of political consequences, the assassination of Yitzak Rabin demonstrates how associated personality with hope and security.
The "bulldozer" has become the grand - father of most Israelis and the last Trump West for American diplomacy and, surprisingly, for Europeans also.
He alone seemed to embody the association of reassuring strength and a vision to gather a majority of Israelis behind him in a process of unilateral disengagement.
In fact, one wonders if the world did not Mr Sharon a providential man because he wanted to believe at all that there was still a possibility of hope in the Middle East.
Was it a vain illusion or a prophecy that will grant?
We shall never know.
What is certain, is that the vacuum created by the departure of Mr. Sharon's political life is even more striking in the light of the images of chaos that emerges in Gaza since the withdrawal of Israel and the collapse before our eyes from the Palestinian Authority.
Nor is the emergence of a new providential personality will happen easily.
These are not all exceptional periods that create their Bonaparte, which is probably preferable, because the exceptional leaders may give the illusion that all problems have their solution, which is far from being true.
The natural course of history in its meaning remains the most optimistic progress involved "on the outskirts", but the rapid pace of technological change leads us to expect a similar progress in human affairs.
We are likely to believe that a such impossible wager can be filled by a providential man only, with all the hopes, and the dangers that this represents.
The fall of the United Nations.
The reign of terror of Saddam Hussein takes his end.
His Government ba' Ba'athist will however not only flow.
Ironically, the United Nations will be living with him.
It is possible that the United Nations does not disappear completely.
The sectors dedicated to "good works" (i.e., the bureaucracies for the maintenance of peace in low-risk or those who fight against AIDS and malaria or to defend the rights of the child) will persist.
The lyrics arising on the East River in New York mill will continue to whine.
The reluctance of the Security Council to endorse the use of force to enforce its own resolutions on the possession by Iraq of weapons of mass destruction sounded the death knell for the old fantasy of decades which saw the United Nations as the Foundation of the world order.
While we are pushing the debris of war to release the Iraq, it is important to preserve the intellectual wreckage of the liberal concept of security through international law as applied by international institutions, in order to better understand.
While free Iraqis describe the nightmare of Saddam's reign, which lasted a quarter of a century, we must not forget what those who supported the war and those who have not supported her, those who asserted that the authoritativeness of the international community was enshrined in pleas to get extensions for UN inspectors and those who demonstrated against the "regime change".
In the spirit of reconciliation after - war that diplomats still want to absolutely promote, we cannot resign ourselves to the obsolete notion shy who wants that world order asks us to shrink back from rogue States that terrorize their citizens and threaten our own.
Decent, thoughtful and full of principles, the millions who marched against the resolution's call to the Iraq account were catalyzed by the idea that only the UN Security Council had the authority necessary to legitimize the use of force.
A voluntary coalition of liberal democracies willing to send their soldiers to stand in the way of evil is not enough.
Regardless of these troops allow to apply the requirements of the United Nations.
If a country or a coalition of countries other than the United Nations Security Council made use of force, even as a last resort, "anarchy", and not international law, would prevail, destroying any hope of world order.
It is believed the demonstrators.
But this idea is dangerously wrong and leads inexorably to justify morally (and even to justify the politico - military existential decisions) of the country as the Syria, Cameroon, Angola, the Russia, China and the France.
If a policy is just when the Security Council approves it, how can - she be wrong simply because Communist China, the Russia, the France or a multitude of secondary dictatorships refuse their approval?
Those who are opposed to the actions of the coalition in Iraq are typically "order" must have primacy over "anarchy".
But is that correct?
The Security Council of the United Nations it represents the institution to guarantee order and save us from anarchy?
History suggests the opposite.
The United Nations was born from the ashes of a war that the League of Nations proved unable to prevent.
The League was simply not ready to face Italy in Abyssinia, and even less, if she had survived that debacle, to fight against the Nazi Germany.
In the euphoria that followed the victory during the second world war, hoping to make collective security was placed in the hands of the UN Security Council, for many poor results.
During the cold war, the Security Council proved completely paralyzed.
Indeed, the decision to defend the Korea of the South against the attacks against it in 1950 was taken by the Council only because Stalin had ordered its diplomats to boycott the sessions of the United Nations, which meant that no Soviet Ambassador was present to exercise its right of veto.
It was a mistake that the Soviets commit more.
In 1967 and 1973, the United Nations withdrew from the Middle - East, leaving Israel to defend itself by its own means.
The Soviet empire was nailed to the ground and the Eastern Europe liberated, not by the UN but by the mother of all coalitions, NATO.
Faced with the multiple attacks on Milosevic, the United Nations has failed to put an end to the Balkan wars or even to protect its victims.
Remember Sarajevo?
Srebrenica and the slaughter of thousands of Muslims under the fallacious protection of the United Nations?
It took countries of goodwill to form a coalition to save Bosnia from extinction.
Once the war was over, the peace was concluded in Dayton, Ohio, and not to the United Nations.
The rescue of the Muslims of Kosovo was not because of the United Nations: their cause never received the approval of the Security Council.
This century is now challenging the hopes of a new world order on new plans.
We will not defeat or even match the fanatical terror if we don't bring the war in the territories that the trigger.
We will need for this use of force against States which give asylum to terrorists, as we have done to destroy the regime of the Taliban in Afghanistan.
The most dangerous States are those who possess weapons of mass destruction, chemical, biological and nuclear weapons that can kill not hundreds or thousands of individuals, but of the hundreds of thousands.
The Iraq was part of those - there, but there are many others.
Hoping to convince them to withdraw their support or asylum granted by them to terrorists is based on certainty and effectiveness with which they are confronted.
The chronic inability of the Security Council to enforce its own resolutions in relation to Iraq, is clear: it is simply not able to fulfill its mission.
Therefore, we remain only with the coalitions formed by countries of good will.
Far from disparaging them as a threat to a new world order, we should instead recognize that they are, by default, the best hope that remains to this order and the real alternative to the anarchy caused by the dismal failure of the United Nations.
Neo-liberalism, and then after?
Twenty years of neoliberal economic policies have brought that disappointing results for developing countries.
Latin America, the region with the most tried to set up the revenue of the 'Washington consensus' (free market, price deregulation, privatisation), has experienced a low and volatile growth digging the gap of inequality.
Among the former socialist economies of Europe East and Soviet Union, little reached real production levels achieved prior to 1990.
In sub - Saharan Africa, most economies are unable to cope with the adjustment programs demanded by the IMF and the World Bank.
The few examples of success occurred in countries that have followed their own pace and which do not really represent an image of Epinal of neoliberalism.
China, Viet - Nam and the India: all three disobeyed virtually all the manual of the perfect neoliberal rules, even when they have embarked on a more market-oriented way.
It is now time to drop the neoliberalism and the Washington consensus.
Remains to the challenge of an alternative, a set of policies to promote development without falling into the trap of a new plan unworkable supposedly - for the well-being of all countries without distinction.
Experience suggests that an adequate program of growth must be anchored in two strategies: an investment strategy designed to revive growth in the short term and a strategy for establishment of institutions designed to provide a strong economy in the face of adversity of economic shocks.
The key to a strategy of investment is to interest the local businessmen in the local economy.
Encourage foreign investment or indulge in the total liberalisation, then wait until the situation improves is not viable.
An effective strategy must achieve two goals: encourage investments in some traditional areas and trim projects or investments that fail.
To do this, Governments must employ both the carrot than the stick.
Discover what a country produces (or could produce) easily represents the main challenge for any economic development.
The policy of the carrot is needed because there are strong to gain socially if we discover, for example, that cut flowers, the footballs or computer programs can be produced at lower cost. Also because this knowledge can guide the investments of other contractors.
The businessman who made the first "discovery" can only capture a small part of the social value that this knowledge generates, and quickly, it is followed on this path by others.
As a result, the entrepreneurship of this type (discover what can be produced) is usually sub - represented due to lack of market incentives.
It must also use the stick policy to ensure that these motivations is not wasteful investments or little wasted productive.
The implementation of such a strategy may vary from one country to another, according to administrative capacity, the incentive scheme which prevails, the flexibility of the tax system, the degree of sophistication of the financial sector and political economy sub - underlying.
Time-limited funding programs, funding of public enterprises and financing of exports represent some means of approach for this implementation, but there are many others.
There is no single way that would work everywhere.
Governments that do not have the capacity to exercise their leadership role of the private sector go straight to the disaster and are unlikely to improve the distribution of resources.
This attempt can succeed, but economic growth requires more than temporary resuscitation of investment and entrepreneurship.
It also requires efforts to build four types of institutions needed to maintain the progress of the growth and strengthening of resistance to economic shocks.
Institutions able to build market (right of property contract).
Institutions of regulation of the market (outsourcing, economies of scale, professional information).
Institutions (monetary and fiscal management) market stabilisation.
Institutions of legitimization of the market (social protection and insurance).
Build and strengthen these institutions however takes time.
Benefit from an initial period of growth to experiment and innovate on these fronts can be highly paid subsequently.
The main thing here comes from the institutional arrangements which, by necessity, are specific to each country.
Find what works in a country any implies some experimentation.
After all, the institutions are not capable of greenhouse plants to be replanted in any soil under any climate.
The reforms that work in an environment may be poor or failing in others.
Such specificity helps to understand why some countries succeed (China, India, South Korea and Taiwan among others) combining unorthodox elements with quite traditional policies.
It also explains why important institutional differences persist among the industrialized countries of America North Europe West and in Japan in such areas as the role of the public sector, the legislative system, corporate governance, financial markets, labour markets and social protection.
While economic analysis can help to make the institutional choices, public discussions and collective choices also have an important role to play.
In fact, considered democracies with public participation as of the meta - institutions that allow to make a choice in the "menu" of institutional arrangements in each domain.
Designing such a growth strategy is both harder and easier than implementing standard neoliberal policies.
More difficult because the constraints that it imposes on growth are often specific to each country and adapt poorly to standard recipes.
Easier however because once these constraints is clearly objectified, relatively simple policy changes can bring a lot of an economic point of view and pave the way for a virtual circle of growth and institutional reform.
This approach does not mean abandoning economic thinking standard, far from it.
Neoliberalism represents for the neoclassical economies that astrology is to astronomy.
In both cases, we have a faith rooted to pass from one to the other.
Critics of neoliberalism should not oppose mainstream economics but only its misuse.
Another central Europe.
A Specter haunting Central Europe while its countries prepare to join the European Union.
This promising development is compromised by a fevered electoral nationalism which seeks to win votes by promising to reopen the old wounds and settle old scores.
The most striking example comes from Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orban demanded the repeal of the decrees issued in 1945 by president Edvard Benes (decrees which confiscated the assets of German and Hungarian populations deported from Czechoslovakia at that time, and which stripped them of their citizenship) as part of a re-election campaign that failed narrowly.
But Orban is not the only one to see an electoral advantage in the evocation of memories of old ghosts.
Orban argued that the revocation of the "Benes decrees" should be a condition for the integration of the Czech Republic (as well as the Slovakia) in the European Union.
Ill will inspired by the operation of Orban has halted much of the regional cooperation put in place during the last decade.
Instead, a new threatening form of national populism is emerging in the plain which extends between Bavaria and the Danube.
Arising from the awakening of nationalism chain reaction dangerously changes the political landscape.
Since the election that brought to power the coalition of parties Wolfgang SchÃ¼ssel and JÃ¶rg Haider in Vienna, the neighbouring Austria with the Czech Republic relations deteriorated on two points: the requirement that the Czechs close the nuclear power plant in TemelÃ­n on the Austrian border and revoke the decrees of Benes whereby the Sudeten Germans were deported from the Czech Republic and settled massively in Bavaria but also in Austria.
Once the question of the resolved nuclear power, populist pressure has been channeled into a single channel, the request to repeal the Benes decrees.
Czech Prime Minister Milos Zeman quickly demonstrated that he could also play a demagogic nationalist card.
He described the Sudeten Germans as "fifth column" of Hitler and suggested that Israel could solve its Palestinian problem by resorting to the Czech method of 1945: namely, the deportation.
Edmund Stoiber, the head of the Government of Bavaria, the candidate of the Conservatives of the CDU / CSU for German Chancellor against current Chancellor Schroeder, and a dedicated advocate of the Sudeten Germans, demanded that Schroeder cancel a planned visit to Prague in response the explosive reaction of Zeman.
In order to defuse an electoral battle with his rival, Schroeder has consented.
The fact that Orban has supported the requirements of Stoiber was felt as a gift fallen from Heaven by the Slovak nationalist Vladimir Meciar in his new attempt to become Prime Minister, since this allowed him to assert that his domestic opponents were preparing to yield to the pressure of the European Union and force Slovakia to compensate Hungarians expelled by Benes in 1945.
Meciar has then jumped, denouncing the "Hungarian threat", cancelling of a sudden four years of work with the current Government of Slovakia to integrate representatives of the Hungarian ethnic minorities in the Government of Slovakia.
Issues relating to the legal order of the Europe of the after - war going well at-beyond from the former Czechoslovakia.
Erika Steinbach, President of the Association of deportees (from the East) and member of the CDU of Stoiber, argued that the issue of the deportation of German populations touches the Poles, Czechs, Slovaks and Slovenes, thus encompassing much of Eastern and Central Europe.
In the 1930s, the bane of some countries of Central Europe was "the Treaty of Versailles".
It seems today that the declarations of 1945 made in Potsdam and that sanctioned the expulsion of German populations represent the new enemy.
The current concern is that this kind of demagoguery can lead to a cycle of populist victories.
This concern has been initiated when Viktor Orban Fidesz party lost recent parliamentary elections in Hungary, but other politicians thrilled to be demagogues of national resentments - Vaclav Klaus in Prague, Edmund Stoiber in Germany, Vladimir Meciar in Slovakia - still see nationalism as an electoral asset despite the defeat of Orban.
Because they are related to the sceptics who are opposed to the European Union such as Berlusconi in Italy and the SchÃ¼ssel coalition - decidedly Haider in Austria, the true nature of the European policy may become unpleasant.
Since its inception, the European Union sought to go beyond old disputes and, through cooperation, to build a better future.
Today, some politicians want to take advantage of the desire of Eastern Europe to return to historical problems to their political advantage.
Such a situation portends two fatal consequences: first, that there is no better way to return parts of public opinion in the candidate countries against the EU allowing local populists to portray the Union as an agent of dissemination of German power.
An extended EU should represent a way to balance the unbalanced relationship between the small countries of Eastern Europe and the Germany.
It is possible that it is perceived as an indication of this asymmetry.
The second concern relates to the fact that while NATO and the EU expand, these unpleasant debates are likely to contaminate relations within international organizations.
This fear may be one of the reasons why president Bush refused to meet the Prime Minister Orban recently and it is frequently question that if Orban spoke as it does now before the Hungary to enter NATO, his country would have been screened.
That could interrupt this process?
After 1945, Western Europe engaged in painful discussions about history, who contributed to franco - German reconciliation.
The notions of "collective guilt" were rejected as having no basis in a unified Europe and unifying.
President Vaclav Havel has so courageously expressed during his first trip to Germany in January 1990, but his comments have been interpreted wrongly to weakness.
The approach to the expansion of the European Union, Europe's mission must not be contaminated by defenders of the idea that politicians of the 'other' former Central Europe prefer to revel in the past rather than thinking responsibly build a peaceful Europe and prosperous.
Bush and Blair must - they resign?
The main consequences of the war in Iraq are not sought on the battlefield.
They will be later because they depend on well - founded by the arguments put forward by Georges Bush and Tony Blair to launch an attack against any population overwhelmingly defenceless.
These arguments have been passionately debated around the world.
If they prove to be justified, the war will lead may be on a more secure world.
But if they turn out not based or cannot be verified, the war could lead on further instability.
In this case, to not make the situation worse, the American president and the British Prime Minister should resign.
The war was not justified and could not be that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant.
The justifications advanced by Bush and Blair are linked to the danger represented by Saddam's regime.
They cited four arguments:.
The Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction.
These weapons constitute a grave and immediate threat.
The UN inspections did not eliminate this threat.
The war was the best way to put an end to this threat.
The first argument will be the easiest to verify.
Bush and Blair spoke repeatedly of stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction and mobile units able to produce and use, as well as ongoing programs aimed at producing nuclear weapons.
They must demonstrate what they argue, and they must do so before an international opinion that believed to be capable of tampering with evidence.
For this reason, that independent experts mandated by the United Nations should examine the evidence that may be discovered.
Without real evidence of the existence of weapons of mass destruction with a real threat, Bush and Blair must go - this, regardless of the sequence of events in Iraq.
The second argument is more tricky to prove.
Bush and Blair must demonstrate that the weapons of mass destruction they have found constituted a grave and immediate threat.
We know that the Iraq possessed chemical and biological weapons because the USA have sold them him.
It is therefore not to know whether there are traces of these weapons - there must remain in storage sites - but subject to availability in sufficient quantity to pose a threat.
If the Iraqi people are now using these weapons, it will be proof that they were ready to be used.
Should then determine whether they could pose a threat outside Iraqi borders and to what extent the Iraq would have used them if the current war had not taken place.
The third argument lends largely to controversy.
Bush and Blair must demonstrate that the UN inspections were ineffective.
They can achieve this by giving evidence that the Iraqis have managed to hide equipment in sites controlled by inspectors.
There should be a systematic review of the sites already visited.
And if we discover weapons of mass destruction in other sites, it will explain why the inspectors could not find them if inspections had continued.
The fourth argument will be used to envy by propaganda on both sides.
The war was - it justified in terms of costs and results? Was - it really the last resort?
To answer these questions, need to objectively evaluate the cost of the war. Need to take into account the loss of human lives, the destruction, the emergence of other forms of violence (e.g., terrorism), as well as the economic impact of the conflict on the Iraq and its geopolitical consequences.
Today, Bush and Blair have managed to convince only a part of their own public opinion.
It served the American people display ranging from simple patriotism to jingoism passing through the manipulation of fear and confusion between the Iraq and Ben Laden networks.
But all this has not convinced the rest of the world, which sees this war with a mixture of contempt and concern.
It will be otherwise if the four submissions prove to be accurate.
When the 13 British colonies in North America have embarked on the war of independence, Thomas Jefferson estimated that it should explain the reasons on behalf of "respect for the opinion of mankind". He set out in the Declaration of independence.
Such an explanation, based on a rigorous argument, is just as necessary today.
If the reasons given for starting this war were not confirmed, the consequences would be serious.
Propaganda, images of Iraqis cheering US troops and British and the astonishment before the precision of smart bombs must not hide a terrible truth: Bush and Blair have broken the peace and organized killings premeditated against the vast majority of world opinion.
Addressing the divisions of the planet requires to uphold the authority of the United Nations and change of leaders in the USA and England.
Given its appalling cost, I hope that this war will appear justified. But in the light of what is known today, I doubt it.
If it is proved unambiguously that the Iraq stored weapons of mass destruction ready to use as to constitute a serious threat and that it was unlikely to allow UN inspections to detect, we recognize the validity of the arguments of Bush and Blair.
But even in this case, the war was perhaps not the best solution, compared to a policy to contain the danger posed by the Iraq.
But in this case, the war has had a meaning.
The idea of a totally absurd war is almost too scary to dare to consider it.
Remembering and forgetting Zhao Ziyang.
So therefore former leader Chinese and Communist party general Secretary Zhao Ziyang has finally died.
The political choices that he had espoused during are mandate are long dead: on May 19, 1989, when he appeared on the Tiananmen Square just before dawn for supplier, tears in the eyes, and ask forgiveness for the demonstrators.
"I'm really sorry," he told viewers.
"I have come too late.".
After that, he played more a historical chimera than a real person.
When his bizarre and unexpected appearance on the square was broadcast on Chinese Central television station the next morning, when one of these last days of coverage without censorship, throughout China, the public was surprised by this fleeting anguish official, and much too humane moment.
After all, the leaders of the party show rarely their personal feelings in public, still less when it comes to transgressing the line of the party also shamelessly Zhao did.
Such individualism corresponds to Leninism or traditional Chinese proscriptions of behaviour for high-ranking officials.
While the repression that followed those heady weeks of freedom of expression and of meeting reached its apocalyptic peak during the night of 3 June 4, Zhao vanished, swallowed by the hole memory party where so many other leaders had come from the "Socialist liberation" of China.
To the discredit of the democratic world, there were virtually no head of State to protest in defense of Zhao, asking only for accounts on its illegal and immoral incarceration.
Instead, the life of Zhao was kept pending, rated under house arrest, if conveniently forgotten as a kind of celebrity in cryogenics, frozen, with no hope of resurrection.
Zhao was not murdered, but simply allowed to live in an old Beijing House with his family.
He was allowed out from time to time, but under guard as a show animal, to go to the bathroom or only playing golf, one of the manifestations of "bourgeois liberalization" that its economic reform efforts had allowed to enter China, once tightly closed.
The Chinese use for a long time the death of leaders fallen as an opportunity to show their feelings, who can no longer express themselves through a regular political process.
During the winter of 1976, when the leader Zhou Enlai (perceived as a liberal in the Maoist hierarchy) died, tens of thousands of people spontaneously overran Tiananmen, offering the party then a fright.
This was, of course, the death of the former head of the party, Hu Yaobang, a liberal of the calibre of Zhao, who sparked the 1989 protests.
It is not certain that supporters of Zhao expressed the same way.
The events of 1989 remain very sensitive and Tiananmen is so well kept that it is difficult to imagine that he can soon there a any demonstration.
At the same time, China seems so clinging to the Affairs of our days that it is difficult to imagine the crowds walk for a cause that would add nothing to their line of total.
It is as if the Communist Party had returned Marx and replaced religion with profit in the role of the new "opium of the masses".
Few people outside the most disadvantaged classes of unemployed workers and dispossessed peasants seem to have the taste of political protest.
On the other hand, Zhao embodied a chapter in Chinese history during which stand as a reformer meant not only the economy but also all aspects of daily life.
Before becoming leader and leader of the party, he had the experience of many areas such as the collectivization of agriculture or the separation of the party from the world of business, until the laws guaranteeing the rights of journalists and greater openness to the outside world for ordinary people.
He was even the first Chinese leader to wear a suit and tie rather than the habit Maoist when he travelled abroad and the first to participate in open press conferences.
Although Zhao was not a visionary, not a Vaclav Havel or a Lech Walesa, and not even anti - communist, its program in the mid-1980s was addressing the world economic, political, cultural, media and social and it led to one of the richest periods and the most open of history intellectually Chinese.
It was a tragic paradox that to see the political movement which had so peacefully swept China in 1989 eventually stop the evolutionary and broad reform process to which Zhao had devoted all his life.
The leadership of the party was so chastened by the trauma of June 4 during the years that followed, it was difficult to determine if the reform would survive.
Then, in 1992, Deng Xiaoping mit moving one of marcheisations of the fastest and most comprehensive company in history, catalyzing the spectacular rise of super - economic power transformed China.
The death of Zhao Ziyang reminds us not only that he was treated unfairly, but also how the Chinese reforms have been uneven.
The Chinese 'miracle' become truly miraculous, party leaders would do well to study the legacy of a man they are now squeezed into oblivion.
The real risks of deficits.
Deficits are back, and they want revenge.
The U.S. Government budget deficit now stands at $ 455 billion, or 4.1 per cent of GDP.
Two years previously, the States - United predicted a budgetary surplus over many years.
Although slightly less affected States - United, the other rich countries sink into deficit.
The European Commission considers that the french government deficit will reach 3.7% of GDP this year, compared to 3.4% for the Germany; These figures go well to the - beyond of the ceiling (3% of GDP) deficit set by the Stability Pact and growth in the euro zone.
Being in deficit, a country increases its national debt and imposes a burden on future generations.
Politicians naturally prefer to conceal the manner in which to perform the movements of resources between generations.
They are designed primarily to address immediate problems and to reap the promised benefits today.
Accountants who compute government deficits trying to stop politicians to fool us by making us accept the benefits that they offer without understanding what will the future cost.
But these accountants offer us no method for determining when deficits are justifiable and when they are not.
Deficits result not only immediate political problems, but also problems of distributive intergenerational justice and inter generations risk-sharing.
No generation should be required to accept unnecessary economic risks imposed by another generation.
The possibility that deficits must correctly process future generations depends on the manner in which are designed a government expenditure and taxation systems.
Proponents of an uninterrupted deficit often depict him as an evil necessary to restore an economy where confidence crumbles.
Inspired by Keynes, they argue that uninterrupted deficits will restore confidence before occurrence of a recession or a depression.
But this is actually equivalent to administer Prozac to a patient before he becomes suicidal.
Such arguments, although they are quite legitimate at times, have limits.
The public deficits of the Japan resulted in a national debt amounting to 140% of annual GDP without to make an economic resurgence.
Indeed, the current budget deficits reflect long-term problems that are not at all what Keynesian theory predicts.
Discussions on deficits must be redefined in terms of problems inter generations important over the long term.
The problems are subtle, because they depend on the actions of future Governments.
In the past, some Governments, when they were faced with huge national debts, "deflating them" effectively.
They thus removing the burden on the next generation which is actually returned to investors who are not retired from the first bond market signs of rising prices or which have delayed acquisition of their house so that inflation would have wiped out the real value of their mortgages.
Governments could again decide to act in this sense, everything especially if national debts believe more.
The resurgence of a considerable inflation may seem unthinkable in the current environment, but remember that even an annual inflation rate of 6% relatively modest decreases the actual value of the debt of a nation in a little more than 6 and a half years.
It is possible that a continuing public opposition to a gradual increase in inflation does not long stand.
Some politicians can again succeed in anchoring the idea that inflation, while challenging, is a boon for the economy.
But also officially measured current government deficits, must also reckon with some imminent obligations caused by a demographic change (declining birth rate) and with the prospect of payments of sums for social benefits in the future.
The scope of these obligations is monumental.
In their 2003 report, the Trustees of the US Social Security Administration Trust Funds estimate that maintaining the solvency of the system of social security for the next 75 years will cost $ 3.5 trillion, or about the amount of the current total debt of the U.S. Government ($3.9 trillion).
The Trustees of the US Medicare Trust Funds (which brings medical services retirees) estimate that floating obligations are now worth $ 5.9 trillion, or more than half of the official national debt of America.
The possibility of a budget shortfall for social security and health is worse in Europe and Japan because of more difficult demographic statistics.
Moreover, in contrast to the official national debt, social benefits obligations are not related to the currency.
They are rather the promise of a certain standard of living (including the value of medical services), corrected for inflation.
No Government can therefore "deflate".
But this does not mean insofar as pensions and other social obligations are completely frozen.
This means that the problem is political.
Pensioners are one of the most powerful lobby groups in a democracy and the politicians are reluctant to deal with them on an issue so vital.
We still have to deal firmly with the inter generations problems which lie at the heart of the current economic dilemmas.
Our pension systems and our national budgets must be based on a "generational accounting" which ensures that economic risk is systematically divided between generations.
This means that pension and tax bodies shall be designed to take greater account of changing circumstances to face the different generations rather than frozen, promises that certainly cannot be held in any event, a certain recovery in the future.
For example, when demographic trends or endless economic events impose burdens on workers at the level of social benefits, the benefits owed to retirees must automatically be changed by the increase in the retirement age and / or adjustment of profits.
These adjustments will probably be in the following decades, but only after a long lag and with several injustices.
We need a system just from the outset in order to manage the risks that span several generations in a rational way.
These problems can - they be resolved today, while the economic slowdown in most developed countries brings most of the politicians to focus on the results in the short term?
Difficult periods, as the Great Depression, helped to introduce decisive changes.
Under effective leadership (which unfortunately seems to be lacking), milder today tests could lead a public discussion on the most appropriate methods of inter generations risk-sharing.
Say no to Bush.
This made three years that American president continues a unilateral programme, refusing any evidence from contradicting its positions and neglecting the fundamental and historic American principles.
Take the example of the warming of the planet.
In this field, Bush is conspicuous by its absence without leave (AWOL in American military jargon).
From time to time, it calls into questions the scientific theories.
(We know, of course, that the academic performance of Bush have never impressed person).
The position of Bush is worse than that: it puts us in a quandary.
In fact, when Bush asked the National Academy of American science to consider the question, the verdict was resounding: greenhouse gases pose a serious threat (this is the only verdict they could produce).
But the American automakers love their cars that consume a lot of fuel and Bush's oil industry buddies admit no interference in their destruction of the planet's atmosphere.
Also did you not change environmental policies.
In Iraq, Bush again pursued a unilateral program, explaining that he had irrefutable evidence of Saddam with Al QaÃ¯da links and that he possessed weapons of mass destruction.
Even before the American invasion, there was overwhelming evidence proving that Bush was lying.
Detection technologies had clearly shown that the Iraq possessed atomic weapons, as the head of the inspectors of the United Nations, Hans Blix, remarked.
It is possible that Bush had read these reports, but they exceeded its intellectual abilities of comprehension.
It is also possible that he did not believe what he was reading.
In any case, U.S. policy was not based on scientific evidence.
Since the end of the cold war, America is the only super - power in the world.
However, it failed to exercise the type of power you need to create a new world order based on principles such as fairness.
Europe and the rest of the world are aware of this failure, but they do not vote in U.S. elections.
Even so, the rest of the world is not without recourse.
The rest of the world should just oppose Bush and him.
America is not acquired the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people, but on the contrary lost, just as she lost the hearts and minds of many peoples.
States - United want to keep control of the occupation but also want for others to take bullets which today are decimating the American troops.
The forces of the United Nations do not have to bear the consequences of the American inability to manage the occupation and therefore calls for the financial support that launch States - United should go unanswered.
What sympathy the American program can - it will attract when you see that president Bush has taught hundreds of billions of dollars of tax cuts to the richest people in the world?
It was yet not so long ago, the Republican Congress retained the sum of $ 1 billion that it owed to the United Nations and threatened not to pay what he owed him only on condition that the United Nations comply with a set of measures.
Lack of goodwill of America to fund little peace contrasts harshly with fantastic amounts Congress quickly entered the war effort.
The advocates of a moderate approach say that if Nations don't get involved, it will be their death warrant. By participating in the Iraqi occupation, it will restore the confidence of the States - United so the next such impact, America will more quickly turn to the United Nations.
It is absurd.
The occupants of the White House today strongly believe in the.
I do usually economics, not politics.
However, at the time of globalization in this new world, economic interdependence is stronger, and requires international action, regulations and more collective institutions, as well as a rule of law.
However, economic globalization exceeded political globalization and decision-making processes are far from being democratic or even transparent.
In many cases, can establish that the failures of globalization go back to the same State of mind that presides over the failure of Iraqi occupation: pluralistic institutions must not be at the service of the interests of one country but of all countries.
During the recent Summit of the World Trade Organization (WTO) which was held in Cancun, developing countries indicated to America, and to Europe, that this system could not last.
In this case, Europe is just as guilty as the America.
Europe has no difficulty to see the dangers of unilateralism of U.S. stock, since the withdrawal of Kyoto until his refusal to participate in the International Criminal Court.
Yet Europe should also reflect on its own practices, including its trade policies, especially when the EU is desperately systematically imbalance the regime of international trade thereby discriminating against countries developing, despite the promises of restoring the balance with the current negotiations.
There, Europe behaves like America, which has long since adopted the rhetoric of free trade while its actions are not for a long time the principles.
Forgotten American rhetoric about justice and fairness, in trade negotiations, States - United ignore the plea of the poorest countries in the world to put an end to cotton subsidies that were so devastating for them.
If we have a politically more secure and economically more stable and prosperous world, political globalization should be at the level of economic globalization.
The principles of democracy, social justice, social solidarity and the rule of law must be extended to the - beyond of the borders.
Europe and the rest of the world should do their share of work: these principles themselves and push each other, and America, in the right direction.
For the moment, this requires "just say no" to president Bush.
The true cost of the war in Iraq.
In life, the more important things, like life it - even, have no price.
But this does not mean that issues involving the preservation of life (or a way of life), such as defence, shall not be passed through the prism of the cold and rigorous economic analysis.
Shortly before the Iraq war now, when the Bush administration Economist Larry Lindsey suggested that the costs could be between 100 and 200 billion, other officials high places quickly raised objections.
For example, the Director of Budget and Management, Mitch Daniels, meanwhile estimated the figure at $ 60 billion.
It now appears that Lindsey estimates were grossly under - estimated.
Worried at the idea that the Bush administration may be trying to fool everyone on the cost of the war in Iraq, as it has already done on the weapons of mass destruction and ties with Al Qaida, I myself am associated with Linda Bilmes, Harvard budget expert, to examine the problem.
Even we who are opposed to the war, have been appalled by what we discovered: our estimates, modest to moderate, vary from a little less than a trillion dollars to more than 2 trillion.
Our analysis begins with the $ 500 billion that speaks openly about the budget Bureau of the Congress, which is ten times higher that announced the administration as to the cost of the war.
His estimate is wrong at this point because the figures do not even understand the whole of the budgetary costs for the Government.
And budgetary costs represent only a fraction of the cost of the whole economy.
The Bush administration, for example, did everything she could to hide the large number of veterans who came back seriously injured: 16 000 for the moment, which more or less 20% suffering serious injuries to the brain and head.
Not surprising therefore that his figure of $ 500 billion ignores disability and health care costs for whole lives that the Government will have to pay over the next years.
The administration does not face the problems military recruitment and retention of troops.
The result is the payment of large bonuses to those who engage again, more benefits and higher recruitment costs: an increase of 20% nothing that between 2003 and 2005.
In addition, the war significantly use equipment, which need to replace a part.
These budgetary costs (without interest) amount to 652 billion dollars for our more modest estimates, and 799 billion for our moderate estimate.
It can be assumed that as the Government has reduced other expenses or increased taxes, these costs have been financed by debt, nor the cost of interest on this debt adds 98 billion (modest estimate) $ 385 billion (moderate) to the budgetary costs.
Naturally, the burden of injuries and deaths is supported by soldiers and their families.
But the army payroll of handicap allowances which are well below the value of the lost revenue.
Similarly, the amount paid for the soldiers killed amounts to only $ 500,000, which is much lower than the standard estimates of the economic cost of a death on a life, sometimes referred to as statistical value of life (from 6.1 to 6.5 million dollars).
But the costs do not stop there.
The Bush administration was once proclaimed that the war in Iraq would be good for the economy, and a door - Word has even suggested that it was the best way to ensure low oil prices.
As is often the case, things were much different: the oil companies are the big winners, and American and global economies have lost.
While remaining extremely modest, we estimate the total economic effect if only 5 or 10 dollars of the increase is attributed to the war.
At the same time, assigned to the war money could be spent for something else.
We believe that if a portion of this money had been invested in roads, schools and research, the American economy would have stimulated more short term and its growth would have been greater in the long term.
There are a number of other costs, some potentially significant, which are very difficult to quantify.
For example, Americans pay annually $ 300 billion for the "option value" (potential value) of their military readiness, which allows them to be ready to fight there where needed.
The fact that the Americans are ready to pay suggests that this potential value is greater than the costs.
But there is little doubt that it has been greatly reduced and will remain so for several years.
In short, even our "moderate" estimate may sub - estimate significantly the cost of U.S. involvement in Iraq.
And our estimate does not include any of the costs involved by the enormous losses in human lives and property in Iraq.
We are not trying to explain that the American people was deliberately misled about the costs of war, or that the coarse sous - estimation of the administration Bush should be put on the account of incompetence, as - ci defends with vehemence in the case of weapons of mass destruction.
We are not either attempting to judge whether there were more cost-effective ways of waging war.
Recent evidence that the number of deaths and injuries would have been significantly reduced if it had provided best personal protections to soldiers show how economies in the short term can lead to long-term costs.
It is undeniable that when the programming of a war is a matter of choice, as was the case here, an inadequate preparation is even less justifiable.
But such considerations seem to be out of reach of the calculations of the Bush administration.
Elaborate analyses of costs and benefits of major projects have been the routine of the Department of defence and other departments for almost a half - century.
The war in Iraq was a huge "project" and yet it now appears that the analysis of its benefits was very flawed and that its costs virtually absent.
One cannot help wondering the following thing: y - had - it other ways to spend a fraction of the 1 to 2 trillion dollars of war in projects that would have better strengthened security, increased prosperity and promoted democracy?
Freedom is sufficient - it?
Democracies have - they need values?
This question seems absurd in the light of the photographs of American soldiers torturing and humiliating Iraqi prisoners.
The fact is that the progress of democracy went hand in hand with an erosion of values and the preponderance of individual autonomy.
It requires moral agnosticism and the plurality of references, none being dedicated and mandatory.
Democracy certainly grown values, but they are generally more liberal - in other words individual rights take precedence over collective obligations.
For all the Democrats today, possible the full respect of the autonomy of the individual remains, as it was Thomas Jefferson, "obvious".
Yet, human rights, civil and political rights are - they sufficient to assert the strength and survival of democracies?
Modern democracies are - they virtuous enough to gather the energies - including self-sacrifice - needed to defeat their enemies?
For a long time, these questions showed no urgency, in part because the basic values of democracy were less abstract than they appear today.
These values have contributed to the fight against fascism and the military dictatorship nazi and Soviet totalitarianism. On their behalf, minorities are views recognize the rights to equality and dignity, decolonization has been conducted.
Democratic values are may be partisan in the defence of human rights, but it gives them a universality which legitimate the fight against oppression wherever it occurs.
However, in the more developed countries, promises of material prosperity made possible by freedom has replaced long attention to democratic values and to their defence as social cement.
Westerners are not rushing to imitate the persistence of oppression and freedom fighters who gave birth to their company, despite the commemorations, sites of memory.
The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 against the States - United changed everything - not only international relations but also the balance between rights and obligations that we consider as acquired long.
In fact, the collapse of the Twin Towers, which was something surprising in its terms, its symbolic character and its extent, has changed nothing.
In it â even, it reveals that the urgent need for a fundamental reassessment required long.
What is truly worth our Western model of democratic development?
Some systems of non-democratic values that seem to cause more membership, because they are based on Community solidarity, religion or nation, in short because closed societies cause less exhaust, doubt and distance, critical or frivolous as public companies.
To the - beyond our economic and social system and fundamental freedoms have - we a specific to defend society?
Our civilization prefers corporations that accept selfishness from his family and his group, who tolerate rare slot reservations "license" in m? URS, which consider the blasphemy, criticism of power and even civil disobedience fundamental freedoms.
Better still worth companies like ours who know headaches such as drugs, prostitution, alcoholism, acts of incivility otherwise vandalism, as a regime of mullahs or soldiers, because these social problems can be dispelled, or even completely eliminated, without changing their foundations.
What is not true of totalitarian regimes or fundamentalists who must be slaughtered to give the day to free societies.
But that can - it replicate to all hair fundamentalists who find that the most resolute fighters are on their side, if our civilization is worth defending?
Can you oppose them anything other than individual freedoms?
Two temptations contrary to our principles should be condemned.
The first is the return to so-called 'traditional', frightened company-specific values:-ci not only would mean the withdrawal and closure but also sometimes hatred.
The second temptation is a modern variant of the gunboat that attaches to physical force without regard to the credibility and legitimacy increased projection.
When enemies attack us, we certainly need to replicate immediately without too much question.
If enemies threaten us, you better first assert its legitimacy, so acquire a credibility, internal first, external then.
It should not be that settles a too big lag between the affirmation of principles and the reality of our behavior.
Values cannot, either, as once, rise to the sky, Nature, reason, or a law of history.
Our values must take body and by the democratic debate, without more, our defence must relate to three areas that cannot be separated.
We will have more need to update our social pact.
The France has tried to do with the debate that it has committed, and concluded by a law on secularism, a significant undertaking even though it could be better conducted and reveal the link between principles, social and anthropological realities and big political.
Such a debate should also concern the school, its rules, its objectives and content it must convey.
Note, however, that, in many countries, political parties have difficulties to engage in such discussions.
The second axis of such action of recreation of values concerns what I call the constitution social and fiscal society, to which must be added the environmental rules.
Issues tell 'Community' issues away from the fortunes, the legitimacy of inequalities, the definition of justice, redistribution, etc will come with a force in the political debate.
This debate took place in the States - United, despite the weakness of the beginning of the era Clinton; There has been an early response to the Kingdom - Uni and in Germany with the third way of Blair and the Variant that gave SchrÃ¶der.
In France, it has stagnated due to the strength of distribution conflicts, too much division of the left and the absence of economic and social of the right vision.
Are the values associated with the new world order: of course, the prerequisite to defend such values is exemplary and not "procedural" values related to terms of settlement of disputes or crises management.
We must also take care that short-term interests do not harm most fundamental objectives in the long term.
The fight in defence of democracy cannot be selective.
A desirable vision for the future of the world must use conceptions of justice and equity.
We must all become freedom fighters.
Last hope for the Venezuela: elections.
The Venezuela is paralyzed in a dangerous stalemate.
President Hugo ChÃ¡vez clings to power despite the apparent failure of his Government marked by severe economic deterioration and dangerous political polarization.
The opposition, tainted by his failed coup of April 2002, now seeks to force Mr ChÃ¡vez to resign by the Organization of a strike general very expensive.
Each party justified its intransigence with tendentious arguments.
His sympathizers glorify Mr. ChÃ¡vez as the defender of the poor besieged by a selfish and plotting elite.
His fiercest opponents present Mr. ChÃ¡vez as a diabolical autocrat, instigator of a revolution to the Cuban ready to annihilate democracy.
These two views are questionable.
The ChÃ¡vez Government has not been a great help for the poorest classes of Venezuela.
On the contrary, his belligerent rhetoric and irrational governance scared investors, leading to economic decline and increased unemployment and poverty.
Today Mr. ChÃ¡vez does not enjoy the support of the majority of the disadvantaged classes.
The opposition consists of the major part of organised civil society of the Venezuela: the World Affairs, but also trade unions, professional associations and NGOs.
Thus the polarization in place at the Venezuela does not oppose 'the poor' "the oligarchy" but a populist to civil society.
The opinion of the opposition, shared by the right wing of the Bush administration, is also convincing.
Rather than start a revolution, Mr. ChÃ¡vez recites that inflamed rhetoric.
While its democratic qualities are dubious, he never.
But Mr. ChÃ¡vez's insistence on the inviolability of the constitution in force is hypocritical.
Four years earlier, Mr. ChÃ¡vez was separated from the old constitution by using a plebiscite to create a new, tailor-made for him.
Today he relies on this Charter to fend off calls for a plebiscite on the continuation of its mandate.
The paradox here comes Mr. ChÃ¡vez gave the example earlier of what could be the solution of the deadlock of today.
Since Mr. ChÃ¡vez used means ruining to promote his desires for change in 1999, that the international community is not limited to the current constitution to resolve this crisis gnawing away at the nation.
In fact, the Latin - American member countries of the "group of friendly nations" who are trying to play the mediators in this conflict can draw of an interesting experience to design such a solution.
After all, such confrontations are not extraordinary for rigid presidential regimes of Latin America.
When the heads of Government elected to fixed terms are more than any political support, they cannot be deprived by a motion of censure as it exists in parliamentary systems.
Presidential systems can therefore suffer from long conflicts that pose a threat to democracy, as is the case in the Venezuela at the moment.
However, during the last decade, the Latin - American politicians have granted more flexibility in presidential systems through innovation in revocation of presidents without popular support.
One of Mr. ChÃ¡vez's discredited predecessors was relieved of his duties after little serious crime of commission charges; the Parliament of the Ecuador declared a "hit of mental incapacity" catastrophic president; in Peru, an autocratic president was forced into exile after months of international and local pressures.
When politicians interpret legislation with a certain dose of creativity in these circumstances, they do generally to ensure the survival of the fragile democracies in crisis.
As long as these maneuvers remain contained and do not become easy ammunition for the opposition of the moment, they act as a safety valve for presidential systems.
International monitoring can also serve as guard - crazy against frivolous use such mechanisms.
Hope that the Group of friendly nations can help implement an innovative solution in the case of the Venezuelan impasse.
To be accepted of the two parties, such a solution can meet the needs of each of the parties.
The opposition prefers a vote "all or nothing" about the continuation of the mandate of Mr. ChÃ¡vez, a vote that she would probably win, but that Mr. ChÃ¡vez will probably never accept.
Mr ChÃ¡vez insists on the referendum of layoff mechanism in its constitution that the opposition cannot tolerate: so get rid of the president would require many more votes than those gathered by Mr. ChÃ¡vez in the last elections.
And the increase of abstention makes this almost - impossible.
Neither of the two proposals is therefore possible politically.
Only a democratic mechanism of solution to the conflict which would not predict the outcome of the consultation is likely to be adopted.
This mechanism, it is the holding of elections, to organize more quickly (this summer seems the most realistic).
Each party will have to work with hard - to win.
The opposition, tense, will have to go to the - beyond of the rejection of Mr. ChÃ¡vez. It should develop a programme for the reconstruction of the country and unite to support an attractive candidate.
President ChÃ¡vez will need to clarify the content and meaning of his "Bolivarian revolution".
Insofar as Mr. ChÃ¡vez is an adroit politician and the opposition remains divided, there will be chances to win, which should make him accept this solution.
Pressure from the Group of friendly nations could lead to each party to accept this last chance to avoid a political crash.
The elections can be legitimized by an amendment to the constitution to reduce the presidential term, as proposed by Jimmy Carter in his recent mediation effort.
Since this would be thought to defuse a crisis of exceptional proportions, this would not create a precedent that would encourage frivolous attacks towards the latino - Americans democratically elected Governments.
The Organization of elections to the Venezuela today would save democracy but does not undermine the.
The Dangerous Liaisons of the Syria.
All eyes are focused on the Syria since the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
Opposition groups Lebanese, as supporters of Mr Hariri, openly accused the regime of Bashir Assad, Syrian president, of being responsible for the killings.
The Bush administration, without formally accuse Syria, is not far from doing the same thing and has recalled its Ambassador in Damascus.
Told the States - United very angry with the Syria and its refusal to withdraw its troops from Lebanon as required by a resolution of the United Nations.
The growing opposition against Syrian hegemony in the Lebanon represents only one of the four similar problems the Syria faces and that she has treated inappropriately.
The other three issues are the actions of the Syria in Iraq, its relations with the - United States and the need for internal reform.
While corrosive immobility is one of the characteristics of the Syrian regime, these challenges threaten to reinforce each other and marginalize the Syria even more than it is already internationally.
In Lebanon, the Syrians continued to misunderstand the intentions of the Bush administration.
Last September, the States - United, with the support of the France, argued the Resolution 1559 of the Security Council of the United Nations demanding the withdrawal of Syrian troops and disarmament of militias, and Hezbollah primarily.
This has happened after the unconstitutional extension of the mandate of the Lebanese president, Ãmile Lahoud, despite warnings French and American, imposed by Mr. Assad in September.
So far, however, Syrian officials say privately that they do not think that the States - United are serious about the withdrawal.
Syrian leaders continue to reject requests from the Lebanon to put an end to the Syrian military presence in place for 28 years.
These requirements are made more pressing since Hariri's death, when tens of thousands of supporters of the former Prime Minister demanded the departure of the Syria, while they did not position so far about the Syria.
Indeed, a broad multi-community opposition front formed in Beirut to demand the departure of the Syria.
However, instead of responding to the requirements of this front and create healthy bilateral relations between countries on an equal footing, the Syria sought to divide the opposition to reassert its control.
The assassination of Mr. Hariri complicates still more the situation and the Syria must prepare for a strong reaction on the part of the France and States - United.
In Iraq, since the fall of Baghdad on April 9, 2003, Damascus has demonstrated a nostalgia moved towards the old system.
Despite the fierce opposition that separated the Syrian and Iraqi Baathist parties, they consoled themselves both thanks to their belonging to a confederation of despots.
For the Syrians, a democratic and friendly Iraq to States - United was always worse than a Saddam Hussein, an enemy they knew well, and with which they have done profitable exchanges, when the Iraq was under international economic sanctions.
The support of the Iraqi Baathist exiles charged to the Syria threatens to harm its relations with the new Iraq.
Baghdad has constantly accused the regime of Mr. Assad to let circulate the Iraqi funds channeled to insurgents and has recently informed the Syrians of the discovery of a photograph showing a senior Syrian espionage in the company of an Islamist fighter, photo found on the body of the latter in Fallujah.
Following the elections, a legitimate power emerges in Iraq and the Syrians must demonstrate foresight by getting rid of their pro - Saddam friends.
The growing impatience of the Bush vis - Ã  - vis the Syrian involvement in the Iraqi rebellion is one of the main reasons for the deterioration of relations between States - United and the Syria.
Indeed, the disdain for Washington for the Syria is clear.
This is why the denials by Syria regarding its destructive role in Iraq are rarely taken seriously and this is the reason why Mr. Assad does no American support for the resumption of negotiations with Israel on the Golan Heights.
Also are some signs that the Syrians are unable to measure the American intentions on other issues.
Mr. Assad, for example, still doesn't understand, apparently, how the Bush administration Associates his regime with terrorism.
Syrian officials believe that the secularism of the Baath party guarantees the unwavering support of States - United against the Islamist resurgence.
They do not understand that American officials regard Syria as complicit in the activities of Islamic terrorist groups in the Palestinian territories, Iraq and the Lebanon.
At home, Mr. Assad regime met also some difficulties.
Political and economic reforms are moving in small steps, when they advance.
One of the key elements of discussion in Syria is the revival of islam as an alternative to a political and economic system that offers only little encouragement, except in the case of the great figures of the regime.
Opposition from France to the Syrian presence in the Lebanon was partly the result of his disenchantment vis - Ã  - vis the reformist ambitions of Mr. Assad and the European Union expressed similar reservations.
Mr. Assad is now in consolidation phase, which leaves little room for reforms.
Indeed, his new Interior Minister, Ghazi Kanaan, a supporter of hardliners belonging to the old school, took the lead of a hardening toward reformers and Kurds during the year that has just ended.
Reworking of last November which power brought Kanaan and others was considered to be the reflection of the preferences of Mr. Assad.
In the coming months, several cycles of retirement should allow the president to place his pawns to positions of responsibility.
The consolidation, however, is not reform.
Mr. Assad will have to show that his enhanced authority can lead to a real transformation.
So far, the president followed a hard line toward Iraq, the Lebanon and Home Affairs.
If it is truly reformist, he has not convinced big world.
The Syria will pay may be very expensive this ambiguity.
The racial house divided Europe.
The European extreme right is characterized by his racism and his use of the issue of immigration as a divergence policy.
The Lega Nord in Italy, the Vlaams Blok countries - Netherlands, supporters of the national Front of Le Pen in France, are all examples of parties or movements formed on the common theme of the aversion to immigrants and the promotion of simplistic policies to control.
While individuals like Jorg Haidar and Jean - Marie Le Pen can (never quite early) come and go, the racial question will never disappear from European policy in the near future.
An aging population and more open borders imply increasing racial fragmentation in European countries.
The dominant parties of the centre-left and centre-right faced this perspective by applying the policy of the ostrich, hoping against all odds that the problem would disappear.
This will not be the case, as clearly demonstrated by the racial history of America.
Racial relations in the States - United have monopolized for decades - and still - monopolize the front of the political scene, to the point that racial divisions occupy a place as important as income, if not more, as determinants of political attitudes and preferences.
The first step to address the issue of racial politics is to understand the origin and consequences of racial animosity, even if it involves the discovery of unpleasant to hear truths.
This is precisely the aim pursued largely by research teams in economics, sociology, psychology and political science at the States - United.
This research shows that representatives of different races are much less confidence with each other; Whites are less likely to support social assistance expenditure which, according to them, promote minorities; racially fragmented communities have less effective Governments, corruption and traffic of most important influence, rates of crime higher and less goods productive public per taxed dollar.
This does not mean that it should eliminate the heterogeneity and create racially homogenous communities, but it is necessary to recognize the reality of these problems in order to start developing strong public policies relating to race relations.
Of course, Americans challenging the methods to be used.
Some are in favour of affirmative action programs that give minorities preference in the allocation of employment, admission to the University and public contracts.
These policies are seen as a means to provide reparations for injustices of the past and, more importantly, create role models and overcome remaining discrimination and may be unintentional.
Others are protesting against affirmative action and argue that a policy that is not race, associated with the policies of the free market and the values concerned pro family, enough to create jobs for minorities and help not to separate the black families.
This last point is crucial in any policy as one of the most important causes of poverty in the States - United is the diffusion of single parents (understand single mother) in the black community.
Whatever the answer, the question is that the determination of measures to be taken concerning the race represents a problem in American politics.
Of course, minorities have progressed towards more integration and economic success.
In the 1950s, blacks themselves could not sit at the front of the bus, today two of the major players in American foreign policy are black.
It cannot be denied that the American right-wing politicians continue to deploy the 'racial card' as a tactical tool.
Take the case of Patrick Buchanan, the former assistant to Nixon and Reagan who was a independent presidential candidate in the last election.
He recently published a book entitled "The Death of the West: How Dying Populations and Immigrant Invasion Imperil Our Country and Civilization".
But for each book as - ci, there are ten more who include a serious analysis of the racial issue in America.
The analysis and policy debates on race relations were a considerable delay in Europe.
At most, the question is scrutinized in terms of quotas for immigration and border restrictions, not in terms of opportunities and social problems created by a Europe more and more mixed racially.
Of course, a clear immigration policy is required in order to avoid the accumulation of illegal immigrants.
But do not leave it at that: the Mexico border controls does not mean the end of American policy on the domestic problems of race!
Europe is rich and its population is aging rapidly: Europeans, reinforced by generous welfare programs, are more prepared to accept a "dirty jobs" in, say, agriculture and the leather sector.
This attitude makes inevitable the increase in immigration.
However, Europeans are quick to criticize the States - United for the failures of their policies towards the minorities and for any manifestation of racism across the Atlantic.
Reading the European press often reveals a complex of superiority towards the States - United on racial issues: they (the Americans) have problems with racism; We are immunized against him, with the exception of the neo - crazy Nazi skinheads and the like.
What has happened in recent weeks, from Paris to Amsterdam, demonstrates that the racial problem in Europe is deepest and, as States - United, a reason the sad truth that racial relations are inherently difficult and that trust and a cooperative behaviour do not travel well on racial lines.
If the dominant parties in Europe commit more seriously to understand the racial tensions that exist in their countries and to place the "race" at the centre of their priorities, individuals such as Le Pen will always attempt to try to fill the void with their message of hate.
Fighting the French exception.
The attention of Europe today is any tour and with about towards enlargement and the constitution currently being negotiated between the Member States.
However, the result of several Gallic spout outlets with the European Commission is no less important in determining the fate of the new enlarged Europe.
The France chose unilaterally to ignore the stability and Growth Pact by letting run its public deficit to the - beyond of the limit of 3% of GDP.
The French like to talk about the rational rigour of their thinking, but where budgets are concerned, Descartes is no place and confusion made his entrance.
The France became part of the main criticisms of the Ireland when, in 2000, the Irish Government reduced its budget surplus, which was then at 4%, only a mere 0.5%.
Other countries did not comply with the stability pact, but the France is the first country to do so with a small satisfied smile openly contemptuous.
None of this should surprise.
The France does that apply to European regulations his usual very well entrenched to consider its own culture as an exception.
Thus, the France consistently opposed its veto to any reform of the common agricultural policy of the European Union.
As everyone knows, the CAP is a very nice gift offered to wealthy European farmers (especially french farmers) who do not deserve at the expense of farmers in difficulty of developing countries and of European consumers.
The France also tries to go back to the old policies of bailout of private enterprises in deficit and on the verge of collapse with great reinforcement of public money.
The European Commissioner for competition, Mario Monti, cannot lose this battle: he needs the support of those who have faith in markets and equal treatment for all.
The story is simple.
The french government plans to bail out Alstom, a company that has developed high-tech products, including the TGV, the french high-speed train, but recently is in bankruptcy.
The french government says it will never abandon its rescue plan for Alstom, a plan that has all the usual dirigiste motivations: maintaining employment, protection of investors, etc.
In addition, where Alstom is a high technology company, the french government plays map of research and development, arguing that investment in R & D is beneficial to growth.
Saving Alstom by nationalizing the company is obviously an error.
The company is comprised of different units, some profitable, others bankrupt: it is obvious that it is necessary to dismantle the.
Profitable units, such as the TGV, will easily find buyer; the loss-making units must be closed.
French taxpayers ' money will be better spent in the temporary cost of retraining of employees rather than to keep alive a company that is not profitable.
It is important that the European Commission does not allow France to carve out laws tailor-made for her - even in competition policy, as it seems to be doing with budget deficits.
The Commission must condemn the public financing of private enterprises in France just as it condemns subsidies in any other State European Member.
The Commission has already had some success on this side - there, including by forcing Germany to cancel Government guarantees of public banks.
Alstom in particular and the France in general should not be an exception and must meet the same standards.
If the Commission does not respond, the European Union will look like even more playground for french officials.
The France has already taken the head of the foreign policy of the European Union with his Foreign Minister, Dominique de Villepin, who acts and more resembles a Foreign Minister of Europe.
At the same time, the France ignores essential regulations of common economic policy and Government assistance for private companies.
The European Commission will lose the little credibility that remains to end up looking like a Parisian district of lesser importance?
Lose on the issue of Alstom would have serious repercussions in Europe and not only for policies on competition.
The war for oil.
For decades, both the Republicans than the Democrats are pursuing the same objectives in the oil field: keep as long as possible, the stability of the oil prices, reduce smooth domestic consumption, reduce dependence on imports and diversify foreign supply sources.
Despite appearances, these objectives are still the same today, under the Bush administration.
Many observers believe that with the invasion of Iraq, Bush has chosen a different path.
A significant increase in Iraqi production would probably increase the oil dependency of the USA.
The price of a barrel of oil will fall without doubt with the appearance of a new source of supply, where increased dependency of the USA, including vis - Ã  - vis of the Middle East.
It is paradoxical that the USA exercised more control over Iraqi oil under the program "food oil" of the United Nations before the war (it was then the UN and not Saddam Hussein which set the level of Iraqi exports) that they will not do so in the context of a future democratic Iraqi State.
If the Bush administration seeking stable, secure, diverse and cheap oil supply sources, it was sufficient to lift the embargo imposed on the Libya, the Iran, the Iraq and Sudan and allow oil to flow.
But the interest of America for Iraqi oil is not dictated by the economy or energy policy.
The Bush administration acknowledged that Iraqi oil is above all a geopolitical asset.
Who controls Iraqi oil controls the Iraq.
Saddam had his power to the fact that he controlled the second world oil reserve.
He knew exactly what he was supposed to black gold.
Faced with the possibility of invasion and the defeat, he threatened to set fire to Iraqi oil fields.
The ransacking and looting of Iraqi oil installations and pipelines shows that virtually everyone has understood that to control oil, is to control the country.
During the preparation of the invasion by the US, the security of the oil fields was a priority.
The goal was not a supply increase or a decline in prices on the American market, but the overthrow of Saddam and its replacement by a new Government.
The future of the Iraq is linked to the country's oil production.
But given the vagaries of the oil market, especially in a situation as unstable, it is unclear how the Bush administration will be able to achieve its objectives in the coming years.
The problem is simple.
The US should use the oil revenues to ease the financial burden of the Iraqi regime change based on the American taxpayers.
A long term, any plan of reconstruction depends on the capacity of Iraq to export significant volumes of oil.
If the Iraq produces no oil, president Bush cannot keep the promises it has made to the Iraqi people, the American people and the international community.
Before the invasion, the Iraq had a production capacity of 3 million barrels of oil per day.
But he may not return to this level of production in the time to establish an Iraqi Government.
An increase in the production requires the development of the oil installations, which requires large investments and a Government in place and political stability.
Nobody, not even the Bush administration, is expected to ensure that these conditions are fulfilled soon.
Political stability is the condition first to increase production capacity.
Experience the Iran, the Kuwait, the Russia and even Iraq, shows that it takes about three years of political stability before the production capacity can increase significantly and sustainable.
It will take several years to the Iraq to develop a new Constitution, establish a democratic Government, negotiate the distribution of oil revenues among different regions, regulate the investment and make the economy attractive to foreign investors.
Also, it will take time to negotiate with multinational oil companies and neighboring countries the realization of studies of feasibility and technical studies needed, as well as reconstruction, rehabilitation and exploration of its oil fields.
Also, even a period of 3 years appears optimistic, because this implies that during this time the occupation ceases, the Iraqis set up their own Government and an end to political instability.
Yet the reality may be any other.
Important voltages may remain for many years.
And it would not be surprising that Iraqi oil production stops abruptly, even with a democratic Government.
History shows that strikes and social unrest that may disrupt oil production occur more easily in a democratic context and under a dictatorship.
If the Iraq is unable to increase its oil production in a few coming years, this will be a thorn in the foot, both for foreign policy than for the energy policy of the USA.
How the latter can - they fund long-term reconstruction of the Iraq?
Who will pay for the maintenance of a fragile democracy in Iraq?
The USA can - they keep their occupation without ensuring the Iraqi people food, medical care and other basic services?
These are hard questions, and cannot be answered until a democratic regime controls and guarantees Iraqi oil production.
Let murderers defend human rights.
If it were not so sad, it would be the macabre joke of the Millenium: the Libya was elected to chair the UN on the Human Rights Commission!
When Caligula appointed his horse in the Senate, the horse, at least, had no blood on her hooves.
Of course, the procedure was perfectly legal: the presidency changes each year in a region of the world to another.
This year, it was the turn of Africa to appoint the president and she named the Libya.
Only the States - United and the Canada voted against.
At their infinite shame, European countries abstained.
This says a lot about the moral bankruptcy of the United Nations that this decision comes at a delicate moment for this organization.
President Bush challenged the United Nations to demonstrate their seriousness about their own mandatory decisions on the Iraq: otherwise, they may experience the same ignominious fate as the League of Nations, which proved impotent in the 1930s when she faced the aggressive policies of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy.
The election of Libya to chair a United Nations body to enforce the human rights currently does little to support the legitimacy or moral authority of the world body.
Remember - you that the Libya is a totalitarian tyranny; its leader, Muammar Ghaddafi, combines a behavior sometimes changing to extremist policies by supporting dictators around the world.
He leads one of the most tyrannical regimes in the world, in which there is no sham election and where contrary opinions are instantly suppressed.
Under his reign, the Libya supported terrorist organizations around the world, the IRA until many Palestinian extremist groups.
It is still liable to the sanctions of the United Nations for the role she played in the attack on a Pan Am flight above Lockerbie, Scotland, a decade ago.
Over the last decade, the position of the United Nations as a symbol of the ideals of a peaceful world community has been regularly undermined.
They proved to be completely unable to stop the war in the Balkans; and in at least one case, Srebrenica, Dutch United Nations peace-keeping remained there and have witnessed the worst massacre in Europe after - war while Bosnian Serbs slaughtered about 6,000 Muslims defenseless.
A Dutch investigative commission later admitted that the Dutch battalion of the United Nations was, in fact, complicit in this war crime.
In Rwanda when the genocide began, the representative of the United Nations peacekeeping operations ordered the evacuation of the forces of the United Nations of the country, leaving the field open to the bloodiest genocide since the second world war.
The name of the representative of the United Nations is Kofi Annan.
It is a depressing and pathetic that United Nations attempt, probably in vain, from redeem past appearing in the Iraq crisis, as the voice of reason and international legitimacy.
But at a time where inspections of the United Nations in Iraq resemble the Salvation Army sent to remove a band of gangsters, it may be that the election of the Libya at the head of the Commission on human rights remains a historic date, that definitive failure of an organization whose creation had raised great hope.
Organizations generally do not die, and certainly, there are too many reasons of State for not guaranteeing that the United Nations will continue to hinder.
But they will only be a mere shadow of what they should, and could, be.
The United Nations of today give hypocrisy a bad name.
Supporters of the authority are there.
Last Thursday, judges of the central court of Jakarta in Indonesia have sentenced me to one year in prison.
I am guilty, as editor-in-Chief of Tempo Weekly Newsmagazine, in the tribunal's view, defamation to Tomy Winata, a property Tycoon, for sub - heard his possible involvement in a fire at the Jakarta Southeast Asian textiles market and of fomenting riots by disseminating lies.
My case and other similar cases presage - they once more the end of a short democratic experiment in Indonesia?
"Riot" that I fomented occurred in March last year, when nearly 200 thugs claiming to be Winata attacked the offices of Tempo, threatening to burn down the building, harassing personnel and wounding a journalist.
To try to resolve the situation in a peaceful manner, I was persuaded to go negotiate at the central police office in Jakarta and is discovered, horrified, as the leaders that the clicks had taken power in the police station.
I was struck by punches and kicks while police forces left to do.
Fortunately, many journalists have come to our rescue with tape recorders and cameras to record these events.
The dissemination of these images triggered public outrage and forced the Parliament to open a public inquiry.
Officials of the national police and the Jakarta police were called, and because of the strong pressure of public opinion, the leaders of this clique were charged.
However, Winata him - even escaped the police investigation by stating simply publicly that his supporters acted without informing him and without his consent.
He filed a complaint it - even subsequently, against Ahmad Taufik, the author of the article, Teuku Iskandar Ali, the editor, and me - even.
The hearings of the trial which lasted one year were marked by a series of suspicious developments all favourable to Winata.
First of all, the folder mounted by the police and the Prosecutor contained documents so blatantly falsified that police charged two officers.
But the Court rejected our request for suspension of the hearings until the clarification of the legality of the record of the Prosecutor.
The case against the officers involved seems to lead nowhere.
On the contrary, one of them was promoted to the head of the new unit anti - terrorist Jakarta which has just been created (and is funded by the States - United).
The other has, dit - on, was returned to the police academy to receive specialized training.
Then, after six months of hearings, the senior judge of the panel of three judges was suddenly promoted to head of a municipal court to one hour from Jakarta.
One of my lawyers noticed that in 35 years of practice to the Court, he had never seen a senior judge be replaced in case.
In fact, despite his promotion, the judge continued to preside over another case in the same building.
A judge who in the past had ruled against Tempo in the civil lawsuit brought by Winata came to replace it.
Finally, Winata, in his testimony, presented false testimony denying having been interviewed by Tempo.
A recording of the telephone conversation was released at the hearings, journalist conducting the interview and two editors who attended testified under oath, the telephone company produced official documents attesting to that phone call as evidence of its existence and experts confirmed that the voice of the recording was well Tomy Winata.
However, the judges rejected the request of Tempo requesting the arrest of Winata that he be tried for false testimony and we advised to lodge a complaint with the police, we did.
The judges rejected our request for deferment of decisions of the Court until the case of false testimony of Mr. Winata is judged.
Having regard to these defects of form, my conviction and my prison sentence are hardly surprising.
But I keep confident to win ultimately when the appeal of Tempo will be brought before higher authorities.
Indonesian courts are more respectful of ethics and the Director of the supreme court is an ardent defender of democracy and freedom of expression. The Tempo case could become a step critical to our democracy, like the famous decision of the supreme court's States - United in the matter of the New York Times against Sullivan.
In noting the tolerance threshold in the accusations against defamation, this decision has helped the American press to claim accounts to public affairs officials.
No country knows better than the Indonesia that freedom of expression and freedom of the press are proven indicators of democratic development and that the penalization of journalists is one of the first symptoms of authoritarianism.
The Indonesia was a liberal democracy in the 1950s, before the muzzling of the press by President Sukarno, assisted by the military junta, in 1956.
Criticism has been quelled, the consolidation of power without however was easy and, in July 1959, Sukarno was able to declare the beginning of the 'enlightened democracy'.
During the first few years that followed the fall of Sukarno in 1966, all the benefits of true democracy, including freedom of the press, were restored (except for the Communists).
However, the regime of President Suharto also embarked on the muzzling of the press at the beginning of the 1970s, by suspending various newspapers and imprisoning journalists.
The press muzzled, other political rights were quickly denied and Indonesian democracy disappeared once more.
Since the fall of Suharto in 1998, the Indonesia has become the third largest democratic country in the world and the first democratic Muslim community in history.
Free elections, fair and peaceful held twice for the election of the Parliament and the direct election of the President, including the last presidential poll, proving the co - possible existence between islam and democracy.
The enemies of democracy do however never rest.
Extremist Islamic groups have embarked on the bombings without distinction, while the groups with pronounced authoritarian tendencies have made a breakthrough in circles close to President Megawati.
But Mrs. Megawati has just lost the recent presidential elections.
Susilo, the new President elected, it will continue to persecute journalists?
My conviction, and the trials and convictions of other journalists, it will mark the beginning of the end of the third Indonesian democracy if hard-earned?
The answer lies in the support of democratic activists Indonesians will be able to generate both nationally and internationally.
Lose the Indonesia, potential Torchbearer of hope of all democratic activists within the worldwide Muslim community, would be a terrible defeat.
The morality of capital punishment.
The United States often criticized their refusal to abolish the death penalty.
Many people today claim that the abolition of the death penalty is a necessary condition to establish a civilized penal system.
Nobel Prize winner Gary Becker is not of this opinion.
European governments are resolutely opposed to the death penalty - the European Union banned completely, and some Europeans consider that its use in the United States is barbarism.
In fact, many European intellectuals believe that capital punishment, and punishment in general, do not deter criminals.
But then Europeans, with crime rates well below those of the United States during the last half - century, could long afford a certain "sweetness" with respect to most of the crimes, he saw their crime rates increase brutally over the past 20 years.
On the contrary, American rates have fallen thanks in part to the increased use of corporal punishment.
Capital punishment in part.
I am for the execution of certain persons accused of murder because, and for this reason alone, I believe that it prevents other murders.
If I was not convinced, I'd be opposed to the death penalty, because revenge and other possible motivations should not serve as a basis for public policy.
Serious empirical research on capital punishment to States - United began with a study of Isaac Ehrlich, published in 1975 in the American Economic Review.
Some studies that followed have sometimes discovered a much weaker deterrent, other power a much stronger effect.
However, the available information is rather limited, therefore not to base its findings solely on the econometric evidence.
Obviously, public punishment policy cannot expect perfect evidence.
But even with the limited quantitative evidence available, good reasons to believe in the deterrent power of the death penalty are sufficient.
Most people, and the murderers in particular, have fear of death, especially when it follows quickly and almost inexorably the perpetration of murder.
As David Hume says about suicide, "no man has ever rejected life as long as it is worth living.
This is our natural horror of death "... "Similarly, Schopenhauer believed that" when the horrors of life reach the point where they exceed the horrors of death, a man puts an end to his life.
But the terrors of death against considerable resistance...
Opponents of the death penalty often proclaim that the State doesn't have the right, morally, to take anyone's life, would be one of the most reprehensible murderer.
Yet it is an altogether erroneous finding to who thinks the death penalty is deterrence.
To see why, suppose that for each murderer executed (instead, say, be sentenced to life imprisonment) the number of murders is reduced by three, which is well below that of Ehrlich and other estimates of the effect of deterrence.
This implies that for each murderer not yet executed, three innocent victims will perish.
In fact, the Government "would" indirectly many lives if it did not use the death penalty.
Save three innocent lives for every person executed seems a very attractive, and even two lives saved per execution seems a cost ratio / persuasive benefit in favor of the death penalty.
It must agree, however, that the argument in favour of capital punishment becomes less clear-cut when the number of lives saved each time dropping.
But even if one life was saved each time, the market can still be desirable if the life saved is much better than the suppressed life, which is usually the case.
Many are protesting the idea to compare the qualities of saved life and that is removed.
Yet I do not see how to avoid such a comparison.
Take the case of a criminal career stealing and killing a victim who led a correct life and leaves several children and a partner behind it.
Suppose that it is possible to save the life of an innocent victim by executing a criminal of this kind.
It seems obvious that saving the life of one such victim must weigh more heavy that take the lives of the criminal.
Obviously, all cases are not as clear, but a comparison of the qualifications of individual lives must be part of any reasonable social policy.
That is also why the death penalty should be used only for the murder and not for less serious crimes.
When it comes to choosing between taking lives and, for example, to reduce the theft of private property, the thesis of the more lenient punishment is far more powerful.
Although severe assaults, including some horrific rape, sometimes approaching the murders in severity, and could possibly call the death penalty, I'm not for its use in such cases.
One of the main arguments to reserve the death penalty for the murders is "marginal deterrence".
If the assaults were punishable by the death penalty, this would push the attackers to kill their victims to not be discovered (which is a major reason for the severity of the punishment is proportionate to the gravity of the crimes).
One of the complications could be however that a murderer would fight with more than pugnacity to avoid being captured, which could cause more deaths.
But, while marginal deterrence is important, I believe that the resistance of murderers to their capture, sometimes at the expense of their own lives, is really indirect evidence that criminals fear the death penalty.
Naturally, the risk of executing innocent people worries me.
My support for the death penalty much dilution if the rate of execution of innocent people was also important as many claim.
However, I believe that appeals to States-United offer enormous protection, not so much against the unjust condemnations that against unjust executions, what makes that there is very little, if any case of executed persons who proved they were innocent.
And this situation was immensely strengthened by the development of DNA identification.
I say again that the debate about the death penalty is a debate about the power of deterrence (which can be diminished by too long calls).
I understand that some are sceptical of the existing evidence, although I think they're wrong about this as well as on the question of the sense of the problem.
It is very disturbing to take the life of someone, even that of a murderer, but sometimes highly unpleasant actions are necessary to prevent worse behaviour causing the deaths of innocent victims.
The people against Putin.
I contributed to the choice of Vladimir Poutine as a successor to the first democratically elected president, Boris Eltsine.
As such the KGB and Mafia structures today lead the Russia and manipulate the judicial system, it is acknowledged that Yeltsin wanted to choose him - even his successor to avoid prosecution.
But we, who have chosen Putin, were tasked to find a successor continue the reforms begun by Yeltsin, and not someone who protect them, him and his family.
Yeltsin was afraid of nothing and did not think its own survival, but the survival of the democratic idea that it had introduced in Russia.
This idea is yet today threatened by the successor we chose him.
I do not seek to deny the responsibility of my support for Putin.
We were not friends intimate, but he and I have worked together in critical situations, and I never doubted his sincerity.
Putin acts according to his beliefs.
The problem is that his beliefs, such as the belief that the Russia can prosper only if it is led by a single source of power, are wrong.
And this gross error is conducting the Russia to his political ruin.
Obviously, no one can hold a high responsibility position without committing misunderstandings, even fundamental errors, and this is especially true when times are troubled.
Yeltsin was no exception to the rule, but he acknowledged his mistakes.
When he retired on December 31, 1999, he asked forgiveness for triggering the war in Chechnya.
Putin, on the other hand, seems unable to recognize and admit his mistakes, and persists in a policy long after its failure became obvious in the eyes of the world.
One Yeltsin errors was his failure to put moral priorities at the head of his reform programme.
The Russia ought to repent of Stalinism and the Gulag system.
The whole nation, without exception, should have to repent, as the Germans have done since 1945.
This failure has, because it allowed unconditional faith of Putin in the central authority leads to a new capture of the State by the security services.
Indeed, one of the direct consequences of national repentance should have been banished from the Communist Party and the disqualification of any policy of those who worked for the KGB.
Even if such political tris are not simple in companies post - Communist, where victims and collaborators were so numerous, and the border between the two sometimes so blurry, a viable solution could be found, as in the Czech Republic.
The choice of doing nothing has left Russian security structures being free and able to make their comeback on the political scene, what they have reached today.
The political resurrection of the structures of the KGB under Putin, and their efforts to silence dissent, have again turned Russia into a country of defectors.
It is impossible to silence politicians and independent media without stifling the independent financial sources, which explains that Putin's Kremlin has concentrated its attacks on the soi - saying "oligarchs".
The arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his trial were orchestrated for this reason.
By removing independent financial sources, the security services that dominate the Kremlin hoped to destroy independent politics in Russia.
Without independent bases of thought, it is a climate of fear that installs.
But fear is not only degrading, it does not allow to govern well.
Yeltsin intuitively understood that fear and centralized, top-down decision-making could be the right way to run a modern country, and it had therefore insisted on reforming relations between citizens and the State.
Putin still doesn't understand that a centralized political system is also unable to understand and correct the errors today as it was in the Soviet era.
Lack of a solid education, Putin is, quite sincerely, conducting the Russia to the same disintegration that accompanied the collapse of the Soviet State.
The people started to realize.
He noted that Putin's desire to create a strong and effective modern State cannot be achieved, as a modern State is governed not from above, but by informed citizens that force their leaders to recognize and correct their mistakes.
Putin, also seems it to suspect the powerlessness of his regime.
It is one of the reasons that made the aggressive Russia with its neighbours, the Ukraine and the Georgia, and the push to maintain a military presence in places like Transdniestria, the breakaway region of Moldova.
In imposing itself in the neighbouring regions of the Russia, the Kremlin thinks he can convince the Russians of his omnipotence.
Because the debates in Russia are castrated and the Kremlin is able to manipulate the elections, regime change is the only solution remains for all to preserve the idea of democracy.
It is vain to cling to illusions.
Those who oppose Putin must decide what they want and announce that if the regime fails to uphold the constitution, they have the right to it is forcing by all means.
Today, the question of power in Russia cannot decide at the ballot box.
As in Ukraine, the Lebanon and Kyrgyzstan, it will be decided in the street.
Tax and spend (please).
Excessive taxation can dull incentives and hinder growth.
But inadequate taxation can also produce the same effects.
Governments with a meagre tax revenue cannot provide essential public goods.
Worse still, a low tax revenue in poor countries often arises from flaws systems (rather than low tax rates) tax collection which also encourage non-productivity.
The India illustrates the importance of a well-designed tax system.
Bangalore, high-tech companies have built world-class campuses full of manicured lawns and ultra - fast data communication networks.
Out of these campuses, however, lie open sewers, not collected garbage and roads in a State of advanced dilapidation.
While technology companies instantaneously transmit terabytes of data to distant continents, local transportation advances to an almost medieval look.
As a result, companies in Bangalore operate their own bus services, sous - deal with private providers to have drinking water, and install generators to protect against power failures.
The State cannot compensate for this disaster because it is in bankruptcy.
The India government debt exceeds 70% of GDP so that more than half of its tax revenues are devoted to repayment of interests.
But debt is not due to excessive spending in the past.
The India government expenditures represent approximately 15% of GDP, compared to an average of about 40% of the GNP of the OECD.
The financial difficulties of the India were rather due to an ill-conceived and mismanaged tax system.
Rates and rules for taxes on income of individuals and companies seem to be reasonable in the light of international standards.
However, the India Government imposes taxes on the income only about 3.7% of GDP, or about half of those in the Korea of the South and the other Asian Tigers.
Agriculture in India accounts for about a quarter of GDP, but even rich farmers pay no taxes.
Exporting companies in the software industry and other industries enjoy a tax holiday on profits, although their employees pay taxes on their personal income.
Despite reasonable rates, tax evasion is rife.
Fraud is explained by the fact that the Government has not invested in staff or systems to discover refractory taxpayers, who rarely go to jail and can often get out of business by paying bribes - - when ' they get caught.
More subtly, the loophole of "direct" taxes on incomes and profits reflects the clutter inherent in the system of the "indirect" taxes levied on production and consumption.
Excise duty account for more than 60% of indirect taxes of India, which in turn represent the same proportion of its total tax revenue.
Basic excise duty was set at 16% of the value of production of a company.
Then follow various reductions, exemptions and surtaxes.
For example, a "duty at concessional rate" of 8% is levied on categories like food, matches, cotton yarn and computers.
A "special excise duty" additional 8% is levied on products that include filaments in polyester, cars, air conditioners and tires.
"Additional excise duty" (not to be confused with the "right to special excise") is levied on "products of special importance".
Exemptions from excise duty are numerous and complex, including companies with total annual revenues of less than 10 million rupees and firms located in some troubled areas or backward.
Generally, the exemptions are divided into 70 categories, they - same sub - divided into 259 entries, 52 conditions and 7 lists, each containing many elements.
Exemptions lead to abuse.
For a certain amount, officials at the bottom of the hierarchy, which show an exemplary discretion in the application of the conditions, can be encouraged to provide favorable interpretations.
Products taxed at high rates (for example, polished granite) are sold as goods taxed at lower rates (for example, as of the granite unpolished).
Fraud concerning excise duty is more contagious than evasion on profits and revenues.
If a business fraud excise duty and tax rate is high compared with margins before taxes in the industry, competitors must also defraud simply in order to survive.
While fraud increases, Governments take "additional" or "special" rights that encourage greater fraud.
Perceptions of direct taxes also suffer.
The pot - de - vin paid to the collector of excise for a favorable classification, the difference between the value of polished and unpolished granite, and the failure to record true revenues create "black" funds that cannot be declared on income tax forms.
In addition to weakening the capacity of the State to provide essential public goods, systems for the escape from indirect taxes also discourage companies to adopt more productive technologies, which requires technologies involving a large-scale deployment.
But because indirect taxes may be more easily bypassed by deploying several small units instead of one large unit, it is impossible to achieve economies of scale.
It is important to note that in the software industry, where all units are exempt from indirect taxes, Indian companies operate on an effective scale.
The India could - it imitate the example of China, the country in which the rationalization of indirect taxes in 1994 paved the way for a big boom?
Or the coalition in a vigorous democracy Governments are - they incapable of such a reform?
Last year, the India BJP-led Government has enacted legislation allowing dramatic reductions in the budget deficit.
He then appointed a working group to make the changes necessary to bring public spending policies and tax policies.
Last July, the Working Group suggested raising taxes (rather than cut spending) by removing the majority of exemptions from taxes indirect, among other things.
The new Government led by the Congress of the India also seems to favour these proposals.
If the Congress and the opposition parties follow, they help much to support the economic growth of the country and to dispel the idea that democracies cannot take the necessary measures to encourage development.
What is the problem with the Turkey?
December 16, Orhan Pamuk, one of the most famous Turkish writers, will have to face a court in Istanbul. It must respond to the charge d ' "insulting national identity" for will be in favour of an open discussion on the genocide by the Turks of 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 and 1916.
Pamuk is liable to three years in prison.
The efforts of Turkey to impose fines and prison sentences to those who are outside the official framework convince me that I was right to oppose the opening of negotiations on the accession of this country to the European Union.
In December 1999, the European Council granted Turkey the status of EU candidate country, which meant that the Turkey would be in the Union at a future date not yet set.
The Council then asked the European Commission to decide before October 2004 if the Turkey meet the political criteria for membership, which include democracy, the rule of law and respect for the right of ethnic minorities.
This decision was one of the last taken by the Romano Prodi's Commission, of which I was a member.
Among its 30 members, 29 said that the Turkey meet sufficiently to be able to continue.
I was the only dissident.
This is the report of the Commission on Turkey, prepared by GÃ¼nter Verheugen, then in charge of the enlargement of the EU, which has motivated my decision.
This report stated that in 2003, some 21 870 Turks have applied for asylum in the EU, among which 2,127 were accepted.
In other words, the Governments of the EU themselves acknowledged in 2003 that the Turkish Government had persecuted more than 2,000 of its own citizens.
In the meantime, the Commission published a progress report on the Turkey felt that reforms were continuing, although at a slower pace under the Government to moderately Islamic orientation of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
This report was nevertheless doubts: violations of human rights, including the practice of torture continued. the military influence retained too large; freedom of expression was not universally observed; religious non - Muslim and cultural minorities were victims of discrimination and violence against women did not meet a sufficiently strong opposition.
The situation has hardly changed since the talks on accession began in October.
To the - beyond persecution Pamuk is currently the victim, unacceptable behaviour abound.
In March 2005, the police intervened violently in an event celebrating the international women's day.
In may, the largest teaching Union was banned for having supported the education of 14 millions of Kurds in Turkey in their own language.
It is undeniable that intolerance reached the peaks of the Turkish Government.
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul recently annulled brutally a press conference in Copenhagen when he spotted a Kurdish journalist in the audience that the Danes refused to leave.
Such acts and such attitudes widely justify my disagreement of October 2004.
But even if these defects were corrected, the Turkey should still not be admitted to the EU, because it is not a European country.
Christianity, feudalism, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, democracy and industrialization have made us Europeans that we are, but they have not made Turks what they are.
I am so confident steps that reforms in Turkey, implemented because of the insistence of the European Commission, would continue after accession.
I suspect even that there are recurrences.
Moreover, the accession of the Turkey would lead to that of Ukraine, the Belarus and Moldova, and may be the Georgia, the Armenia and the Azerbaijan.
These first three countries are surely more European than the Turkey.
Leaving aside the three Caucasus republics, but including the States that succeeded Yugoslavia, this would result in an EU of some 35 members.
What kind of Union would that be?
The EU is not just a club of friends.
It is based on the freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and persons.
The Commission, as guardian of the treaties of the Union, must protect these four freedoms, which means that it must sometimes persuade, and if necessary compel, by Member States to change their laws.
Policies regarding alcohol in Sweden, the Act - Volkswagen in Germany and the discrimination against the funds of foreign investment in France are examples of cases that have made the unpopular Commission.
But they were needed.
At the time I left the Commission, I-devers me a stack of 1,500 findings of irregularities in this style.
In short, the EU accession implies acceptance of incisive measures that deeply affect the internal affairs of a State.
This will prove impossible with such disparate members.
The EU would fall victim to what the historian Paul Kennedy calls the "Imperial overextension".
It would dilute itself in an unacceptable way.
It is for this reason that former french president ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing feared that the entrance of the Turkey leads at the end of the EU, and it is for that reason that the former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said: "the accession of the Turkey would be more than what the EU does in could withstand".
But the strongest reason to oppose the accession of the Turkey is a matter of democracy: the majority of the population of the EU simply wants to.
The Bolivian crisis, failure of Latin America.
The Bolivia is not a typical country of Latin America, far from it.
And if that wasn't Haitian disorders, it would be the poorest country in the Western hemisphere: it is even less stable than Haiti as shown in its history and its two hundred coups d'etat since independence.
In a region with a strong indigenous past, but to present dispersed and isolated, the Bolivia is perhaps, with Guatemala, the only Latin American country where indigenous peoples make up the majority of the population.
Its topography and its ethnic distribution generate the autonomist forces and even secessionists threatening national unity of much more provocatively than anywhere else.
And it is, of course, with Paraguay, the only country of the sub - continent private access to the sea.
Thus, it would be nice little cautious to extrapolate the current crisis Bolivia to the rest of Latin America.
The generalization would be far too simplistic: elsewhere, institutions are much stronger, poverty, and particularly poverty, has been reduced and the struggles of appropriation of natural resources were generally settled.
Even in countries such as the Venezuela, which has huge oil reserves and which is equipped with a traditional spirit-nationalist government, the status quo maintained allowed the preservation of foreign investment during the nearly eight years of Government of president Hugo Chavez.
Even if the existence of indigenous movements is a reality in many countries, since the Chiapas until the 'Araucania', of Amazonia to Ayacucho, they have never posed any real threat to national integrity in any country of Latin America.
Thus, the Bolivia does not live a premonitory crisis, nor the eternal "domino theory", in which Lyndon Johnson and Che Guevarra believed both in the case of the Bolivia, seems no valid or even partially reasonable.
However, the current crisis in Bolivia shows of the 'democratic deficit' finger afflicting Latin America.
Elected leaders are being failed for one reason or another in Bolivia, Ecuador and Haiti.
Democracy is failing or absent in Cuba, the Mexico and the Nicaragua and threatened pure reason or another in the Venezuela and Colombia.
None of these cases does not resemble the other and they all have different degrees of danger, of destruction and reconciliation.
Remains to be seen what can be done against this state of affairs, contrasting harshly with the encouraging prospects that have prevailed until recent years.
During the last meeting of the Organization of American States, which was held in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., the delegation of the States - United has borrowed a good idea provided by others and it has just leaked because of its support.
The story began two years earlier when Dante Caputo, a former Argentine Foreign Minister, and the development of the United Nations (UNDP) program were tasked to prepare a report on democracy in Latin America.
Their findings indicated that an early warning system of democratic crises in the region would help to generate certain actions before any loss of control, as is the case of the Bolivia today.
Mr. Caputo and the team of UNDP had then convinced Chilean president, Ricardo Lagos, to take the initiative and promote it with several of his colleagues.
What he did without that the initiative did not go very far.
In fact, the UNDP report on democracy in Latin America, published in 2004, the mentioned barely.
The - United States and the new Secretary general of the OAS, JosÃ© Miguel Insulza, have revived it at the meeting of the OAS in Florida, but she was killed by the reasonable fears of Latino - persuaded Americans that there is an action against the Venezuela, associated with the anachronistic fears of Latino - Americans on the violation of the sacro - Holy principle of non-intervention.
Despite the impossibility for the continent to agree on the principle, the idea of an early warning system deserves to be studied.
Today, the Latin - American community probably has little possibility of intervention on the Bolivian situation, and yet it is dangerous for everyone.
Evo Morales, the leader of the opposition and leaves of coca growers may be an honest leader democratic, somewhat misguided, but his supporters are - they all cleared of any authoritarian desire?
Hugo Chavez does finance may not be Mr. Morales and other Bolivian dissidents, but Venezuela and Cuba are - they not tempted to meddle in the Affairs of this country where Che Guevarra died at the head of the guerrillas nearly 40 years earlier?
The business in Santa Cruz, Bolivia community won't give may not be following its threats of secession, but prefer - they share the reserves of oil and natural gas in their region with the native peoples of the Highlands rather than with Brazilian industrialists of SÃ£o Paulo?
Before events reach extremes, it would be good as the OAS (and not States - United) gets involved.
The area continues to be in need of this participation, in terms of time, message and platform - appropriate, separate democratic form of traditional American intervention and the usual Latin American indifference.
The decline of the France?
The French are notoriously sensitive, not to say on the defensive, as the scale of the France abroad.
The french State spends a substantial amount to the dissemination of the language and French culture, but the French are painfully aware that their country's global position is what it was.
In this context, it is therefore not surprising that during the last presidential elections, the publication of a report from the European Commission stating that the economic status of the France among the European countries had increased from 3.
The OECD and Eurostat, the European body to gather such data, thought have put an end to this aspect of the debate by demonstrating that France, Germany, the Italy and Great - Britain were all nearly identical levels of life per capita.
But the controversy on a wider scale has not disappeared so far.
Worried rumors about the "french decline" have made their reappearance with the protest marches that took place this year against the pension reform, the growing disputes over fiscal policy with the European Commission and the bickering with America on the war in Iraq.
Not fictionalized book, which was a great success in France at the moment is a polemic written by Nicolas Baverez, La France falling.
The book by Baverez is filled with quotes from de Gaulle and Napoleon.
According to the author, the latest achievements of the France date back to the 1970s, with the fast train, the TGV, and Airbus.
He severely criticized Mitterrand and Chirac joined together by a 'talent common to win elections to the France a loser'.
The success of the book is in it - even a sign of "unease".
But what kind?
Evidence of degeneration by Baverez are also unconvincing that it is willing to believe it.
For example, he cited the exhaustion of industrial employment as the most flagrant proof of the decline of the France.
But deindustrialization is a reality shared by all developed countries.
Indeed, the France gets in fact better than most of its rich neighboring competitors and, in contrast to Germany, the UK or the States - United, it has preserved the same global market share in the industrial sector than it held in the early 1970s.
In addition, according to a more precise measure of competitiveness and foreign investment, the France obtains excellent results in these areas.
According a recent report by the Council for economic analysis, direct investment in France are passed to 60 billion euros in 2001, is almost two times more than the Germany.
The French cost competitiveness also improved (20%) in the past three decades, higher productivity offsetting rapid wage growth.
But the heart of the economic problems in the long term of the France lies precisely in the fear of losing industrial jobs.
France remains a strong industrial power in traditional sectors such as automotive and aerospace, but it has been delayed in innovative markets where smaller companies spread new technologies.
France, for example, devotes only 30 billion dollars per year - in research and development of advanced technologies, against $ 51 billion for Germany, 98 billion for the Japan and 265 billion for the States United.
In short, Baverez analysis goes in the wrong direction.
The France undertook several extremely reforms over the last two decades: economic and financial liberalization the elimination of controls of prices and exchange rates, the end of restrictions on credit, European liberalization, reduction of inflation and trade deficits, the advent of the euro and globalization forced the companies in the country.
Certainly, the french malaise was not induced by these reforms.
The problem of the France of what it has failed to acknowledge the new world which it already belongs.
French capitalism is dead and the France is unable to accept his demise.
The France must be the only country in which a Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, felt compelled to apologize after saying on television that "the State is not all - powerful".
There are several reasons to explain this French schizophrenia, but the most important of them is the political game of the past 20 years.
Until 1981, the France was clearly divided between left and right.
Since this period, Mitterrand and Chirac administrations blunted their ideological side in order to implement the difficult process of adaptation to Europe and globalisation.
"Electroshock therapy" to Mrs. Thatcher two decades previously could forge a new political consciousness.
But the transition slow and consensual reforms allowed the French to live in a world and think in another.
This state of fact largely the political cataclysm that exploded during the last presidential campaign, when the leader of the far-right Jean - Marie Le Pen reached the second round of the presidential elections before outgoing Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
The rise of the extreme left, which brought together 10% of the votes during this presidential campaign, also attests this political failure.
The France needs a political revolution more that of an economic revolution if it wants to accept the reality, including the fact that the "french decline" is a fear created by the french people.
The value of European values.
European leaders resumed the constitutional discussions that ended in December after a dispute over voting rights.
These debates should obviously lead to compromises, it will not be long.
Yet to understand clearly what are the objectives for the constitution supposed.
Two fundamental principles have presided over European integration: solidarity and subsidiarity.
These two principles stand at the crossroads of philosophy, politics, economics, sociology and law.
For years, they have is part of the legal and institutional structure of the European Union, in the treaties, the Charter of fundamental rights (which quotes them in its preamble) and in the recent front - draft Constitution.
To sum up, they are registered in the history and ideals of the EU.
But what is the real meaning of these two principles?
Take solidarity, which lends itself to at least two interpretations: static solidarity, which concerns only the distribution of income and wealth, and the broader concept of dynamic solidarity, which deals with the production of income and wealth.
In history after - war of European integration, dynamic solidarity strongly manifested itself during the first period, that of the European Community of coal and steel, both in its strategy of economic development (reconstruction) in the treaties, particularly the Treaty of Rome.
This does not mean that dynamic solidarity has been subsequently deleted: European Monetary Union, for example, perfectly expressed this principle.
Thus, although some countries have not immediately benefited from the euro, they nevertheless accepted it because they were convinced that it would have positive effects on the long term.
In other words, dynamic solidarity means encouraging policies that promote investment, innovation, economic growth and employment.
However, as indicated by the growth of GNP in the EU, dynamic solidarity has been shaken over the past decade.
The gap between the research and development is a particular concern.
The implementation of the self--saying Lisbon strategy of the EU, adopted in 2000 with the promise of creating the most competitive in the world economy, is threatened by the growing emphasis on static solidarity, which is reflected in the high costs of social assistance and the taxes necessary for its financing.
The primacy of static solidarity is due to an aging population which, together with slower growth, resulted structural fiscal imbalances.
One of the greatest challenges facing the future of the EU is to treat the current predominance of static solidarity, which is geared towards the elderly, at the expense of dynamic solidarity, which promotes youth.
After all, the Union cannot allow current consumption to continue to outweigh the investment needed for future prosperity.
Subsidiarity is similar to the concept of solidarity in that its interpretation is also double: vertical subsidiarity and horizontal subsidiarity.
Vertical subsidiarity concerns the distribution of powers between the different levels of Government and sovereignty: the EU, the Member States, the regions and municipalities.
The best-known application of this principle is federalism.
The European Treaties clearly express this vertical subsidiarity.
But is it enough to include constitutional and institutional framework emerging from the Union?
Horizontal subsidiarity concerns the responsibility and freedom of human beings as well as on the social and economic powers.
It includes the relationship between the State, society and the market.
But the company and the market have their own rights and their own sovereignty which are not granted by the State.
Then arises the following problem: how to ensure the autonomy of each Kingdom?
Examples of horizontal subsidiarity the internal European market, which has created a new type of economic freedom and increased competition between companies by eliminating the protection that national governments offered them.
Horizontal subsidiarity means that in the society and in the economic sphere, the State cannot violate the freedom and individual responsibility, which must be respected at the highest level possible.
It also implies that a "higher power" should support whenever individual freedom and responsibility are not enough to the objectives required for human dignity.
However, this support must be provided in ways that promote the natural potential of individuals, society and the market.
But this is possible that if the role of horizontal subsidiarity is clearly stated, what has not been the case in the European treaties, the Charter of fundamental rights or the work of the European Convention.
To summarize, the solidarity today implies a redistribution rather than growth (this is as well as the current generation expresses solidarity with future generations) while subsidiarity concerns the distribution of political power rather than a careful definition of the borders between the State, civil society and the market.
At present, these two values are defined so as to foster the State.
Indeed, emphasis on the market-oriented growth has often been identified with semi - America foreign values.
But these values are deeply rooted in Europe and they must be uprooted again.
The EU must restore its economic vitality by pursuing a model of solidarity and subsidiarity more balanced in favour of the market and society, which would decrease the socio - economic influence of the State.
Public institutions must produce public goods (such as defence, justice and fiscal and monetary policy), the company must provide social goods (such as culture, education and aid to the needy) and the market should produce economic goods (related to profits, growth and employment).
In the 21st century, Europe must reconsider the value of these two principles (solidarity and subsidiarity) if it wants to achieve the historic objective of integration: freedom and well - be needed to overcome differences and political divisions that have led to tragedies in the 20th century.
This is the spirit in which must be drawn up for the European Constitution.
The politics of values.
The debate on the American elections has still not abated.
How president George W. Bush he could get three million votes more than Senator John Kerry, and, in addition, afford a Republican majority in both houses of Congress?
There is little on the responses, but two themes are recurrent in numerous explanations.
One of these themes is his personality.
Our time full of uncertainty and threat, citizens have placed their confidence in a president they knew rather than in a candidate has not yet been proven.
The second is that of the values.
The citizens voted for a set of values rather than for specific policies.
Indeed, some (dit - on) are consistent with the policies of Mr. Kerry but have yet made their voices to Mr. Bush because they felt "uncomfortable" with all of his attitude.
It is clear that States - United are now deeply divided in electoral terms.
An arch of blue (Democratic) States in the East, North and West stretches around a huge red zone (Republican) in the centre and South.
To the - beyond the geographical division, divisions breed at the local level.
The electoral gerrymandering, this practice of tracing of the electoral boundaries to promote a political party at the expense of another, is no longer necessary.
Voters tend to move into areas where the majority of the inhabitants share their values, be they Republican or Democrat.
What are these values exactly?
These are the values which deal with what we are told, "God's arms and gay".
Religion plays a role, including the specific bible truths in the field of the creation story.
The possession of a weapon is the ultimate test of individualism and the use of weapons during wartime is not obnoxious.
Gays and other "modern" practices are rejected as self-indulgent.
As the political scientist Andrew Hacker said recently, "the candidacy of Mr Bush was built to form a majority" by giving 60 million voters the chance to feel good vis - Ã  - vis of themselves.
All this is - it an American phenomenon although there are other trends elsewhere?
One of the answers wants that as American phenomenon, policy values may well order a majority today but is certainly not General.
Europe and other regions of the world are divided in the same way.
Personality has no doubt, and under the obvious political differences also are questions of values which have not yet been highlighted.
However, the traditional political differences based on disagreement about core values play a role always less important in the elections.
Prime Minister Tony Blair, for example, another leader to face an election in his country, plays the card of personality and speaks of policies, but is before a whole range of middle-class values.
When he speaks of "modernization" or "to enter the twenty - and - 21st century", he manages to suggest a strange but appealing mixture of change and stability.
This leaves the conservative opposition without any effective response.
Even cuts taxes and stricter asylum issues are unable to fly on the strings of the melody of the values of the Republican party has managed to hear the States - United.
The situation is the same in Germany, where the influence manifest policy values is even less.
The debate in Germany is still in its most political debate.
When the opposition offers to the Government to negotiate the reform of social protection or, more recently, to fight against unemployment, the challenge - underlying is not positioned in terms of values but rather jurisdiction.
However, under the fields of traditional battles of political debate English or German, or elsewhere in Europe, the clashes of values threaten.
The parties are fighting for those who can "feel at ease in their own place", but they do understand may not be very well that this is only partly a question of policy.
Religion will never be a significant factor in European policy: opinion polls show that religious practice remains one of the few major differences between Americans and Europeans.
The weapons also occupy a different place in European minds: it is their absence that Europeans consider as important.
Europe lives also without doubt a current of pacifist values.
And the question of political correctness ("gays") also plays a lesser role in Europe so far.
Above all, Europe it - even divides Europeans, because the 'national question' is present in all European States.
It is a question of values inspired by fear.
Citizens want to know where they stand, and in the aftermath, turn against the States - United and to Europe or against Europe and towards their own country.
Anyway, we then leave the Kingdom of policies and even policy and enter in the marshy field symbols and the myths.
What, in any case, represents the main danger which democracies must face, because politics of values is a dangerous development.
It reintroduces fundamental divisions of a company whose democratic achievement was precisely to banish fundamentalism from politics.
An informed public debate must be a discussion on the policies contained by a community of values.
It is therefore essential to insist on this central objective of the policy of freedom.
The advent of the interest.
One swallow does not make a summer, and one month of normal growth of employment and rising States prices - United does not mean that Federal Reserve fear more economic malaise and deflation.
But the time will come when world interest rates will begin to rise as central bankers are preparing to resist the wave of rising inflation.
When this moment arrives, be it this fall, in 2005 or 2006, or well in 2007, America and the world economy will face financial vulnerabilities that will reflect the success of the past three years of monetary stimulus in arresting the decline of production and moderating unemployment.
Short-term interest rates are amazingly low: only 2% in the euro area, just 1% to the - United States and zero to the Japan.
The expansionary monetary policy has proved be a success, but only after having brought interest rates to historic lows and have convinced investors that borrowing costs would remain at their current levels for a long time.
The monetary stimulus was primarily for an increase in the prices of the assets: everything that produces a profit, a dividend or a rent becomes much more attractive, and so much more valuable financially, when interest rates are very low and should remain.
This explains the considerable differences in current prices of real estate in the United States, shares in New York, London and Frankfurt, and the obligations on the long term all over the world and what should be, in a conventional manner, their core values.
Qu ' happen when central banks begin to raise interest rates?
In 1994, the increase in short-term interest rates resulted in an increase in the rate over the long term (and a decrease in the prices of bonds in the long term) of at least twice that predicted by standard models this year - there.
The interest rate of the peripheral economies of developing have also increased much more than the rate of the major advanced industrial countries.
The first danger for 2005 and for the years to come, when global interest rates increase, as is likely, is another wave of financial crises in emerging markets.
For countries such as the Mexico, the Brazil, the Turkey, the Argentina, the Korea, the Malaysia and the Thailand, the record of the 1990s shows that differences in interest rates can grow and capital flows reverse remarkably rapidly, regardless of the degree of benevolence with which the representatives of the IMF and the analyses carried out by the major banks consider the policies of a country.
The differences in emerging markets interest rates are currently abnormally low.
International monetary flows, inflow of capital to the States - United excepted, are not yet at levels associated with "irrational exuberance", but there are chances for that to happen before interest rates start to rise.
This prospect is alarming because if there is a lesson of the 1990s, it is that no one should overestimate the stability of international financial flows.
The second danger comes from high values of the assets in the major advanced industrial countries.
The mode of thought dominant within the Federal Reserve, with which I agree fully, argues that the information technology revolution is continuing, as the production potential in the States - United still grows very quickly and that the output gap is thus relatively large.
This implies that interest rates should certainly stay low for a period relatively long.
In addition, confidence in the Federal Reserve is great and the last vestiges of the premium for the risk of inflation of the 1970s are more no interest rate.
As a result, even after production levels have returned to their potential level, interest rates will remain low according to the standards of the 1980s and 1990s.
Of course, all this is good news for all those who hold assets such as bonds over the long term, shares and property.
Indeed, the increase in the price of assets over the long term was precisely what aspired the decline in interest rates: make the bond, and in particular homeowners, more rich gives after all a boost to spending.
But the bad news is that even if interest rates are expected to remain low for some time, they will stay as low indefinitely.
The main thing is that when interest rates rise, the asset values fall.
During these periods, and particularly when the asset values fall rapidly and significantly, as we discover fully the level of skill of our central bankers in their main task: reduce financial volatility and economic stability.
It is also during these periods that we discover how the individuals who hold bonds on the long term, real estate or shares hold them because they think that current prices are interesting compared to basic prices, but because their prices have increased in recent years.
This is a crucial issue for policy makers because the individuals who bought assets in the long term because the price seemed to increase indefinitely are also those who will sell as soon as the trend seems reversed.
In particular, the trade deficit of the States - United presages a massive instability should long-term asset prices drop considerably.
It is certain that the challenges that arise in the economic policy makers of the world in the years to come will differ from those they have been facing since the collapse of the illusion of the NASDAQ.
The risks associated with inflation are probably less dangerous than those generated by a falling production and the threat of deflation.
But, as we learned during the 1990s, this does not mean as far as future challenges will be easier to resolve.
America's opposing futures.
I recently discovered an interesting fact: American economists who deal with international finance and American domestically oriented macroeconomists have very different view - in fact, opposed â on the possible consequences of the huge U.S. deficit.
International finance economists consider that a financial crisis is possible, followed by a painful recession and may - be extended to States - United.
Macroeconomists dealing with the domestic economy instead see a next fall in the value of the dollar not as a crisis, but as an opportunity to accelerate growth.
Macroeconomists that examine the domestic economy generally consider the situation as follows: at some point in the future, foreign central banks will be less inclined to continue their massive purchases of securities in dollars to support the greenback.
When they will end their large-scale dollar-purchase programs, the value of the dollar will fall, and it will drop strongly.
And, from this point of view, if the value of the dollar declines, U.S. exports will become much more attractive to foreign markets and the U.S. job market will resume, the workforce being redirected to the new export booming sectors.
The situation will be comparable to that of the Great - Britain when it abandoned its exchange rate indexing and left the pound to depreciate versus the German mark, or what happened to the States - United at the end of the 1980s when the dollar was dÃ©prÃ©cia against the pound, the mark and - especially - versus the Japanese yen.
International finance economists describe a darker future.
They consider that the end of the programs for the purchase of dollar on a large scale by the central banks will lead not only to the decline of the dollar, but a surge in long-term U.S. interest rates, also which will immediately drop the household consumption and will regulate capital expenditures after a short period of time.
Certainly, international finance economists also consider that U.S. exports will benefit from the fall in the dollar but shifts in demand are such that the boost of exports will occur only one or two years after the decline in consumption and investment spending.
Eight to ten million people will have to go sector services and construction sector's import - export of goods, implying that structural unemployment will increase.
In addition, there will be may be a financial panic: large financial institutions with short-term obligations and long-term assets meet difficulties to support a surge in long-term interest rates denominated in dollar.
This factor of inequality may cause some financial tension and bankruptcy just as easily as those caused during the Mexican crises and Eastern in the 1990s or the Argentinian crisis of this decade of the fact of assets in local currency and dollar bonds held by banks.
When international finance economists highlight this scenario, specialized in the domestic economy macroeconomists respond them that this looks like a case of incompetence in monetary policy.
Why the Federal Reserve should - it allow the increase of interest rates in the long term when foreign central banks will cease their dollar-purchase programs?
Should - she not then intervene and take over by the purchase of U.S. Treasury long term obligation, keeping interest rates in the long term at a satisfactory level to encourage full employment?
International finance economists generally respond to this that the Federal Reserve doesn't have the capacity to do so.
Forced to choose between full employment and price stability, according to them, the Federal Reserve will choose the stability of prices, because its institutional memory of the 1970s and the soaring of inflation remains very strong.
Thus, since the fall of the value of the dollar raises prices for imports and thereby functions as a negative shock on the supply side in the economic sector, the Federal Reserve must increase and reduce its interest rates and sell rather that buy Treasury bonds.
Serious economists whom I respect greatly themselves to take a stand in opposing this debate sides.
I am not wise enough to give one or the other, but I know without a doubt what side I hope to see go wrong.
Bad students of Europe.
States - United States pursuing fiscal policies misguided are penalized.
Their obligations are selling at a discount compared to those others managed better.
Servicing the debt higher that they must pay serves, to some degree, of disciplinary action against the temptation to spend now and pay more later.
Naturally, the discipline of the market is not perfect: the bond market "is" not really implicit future liabilities (like promised pension payments).
However, the application of this fiscal discipline, combined with internal budgetary processes of each State, has prevented the occurrence of fiscal crisis of great magnitude in the USA - since the Great Depression.
Consider the case of Europe.
Before the advent of the euro, of many southern European States experienced fiscal crises, producing high inflationary wave.
But with the establishment of the single currency, the way to resolve a fiscal crisis by inflation has been closed, since the European Central Bank (ECB) monitors the monetary policy.
However, even if nations can no longer rely on inflation to solve the imbalance of their finances, the single currency allows them to use the debt capacity that belongs to other members of the European Union to extend their spendthrift folly and repel their political responsibility for periods of let the good times roll.
This is to avoid the possibility that the EU has created the stability and Growth Pact: Government budget deficit must not exceed 3% of their GDP.
Last week, the German Government, formerly the European country most prudent and disciplined to the tax level, has violated the rules of the Pact for the fifth consecutive year, without really (much) apology.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck said that he expected the European Commission to apply sanctions against the Germany: the credibility of the Pact would be, said - it, put at risk if no action was done.
Thus, the Germany would not interfere with sanctions this time, as was the case there are two and a half years.
But Steinbrueck has also made it clear that it expected only a purely symbolic sanction in response to the budget deficit representing 3.4% of GDP, and not to penalties which would have a true cost to his Government or economy.
The stability and Growth Pact is not, or not yet, in the process of work as originally planned.
What is - it of the discipline of the market?
The will of the German Government to increase its debt and widen its deficits is - it limited by the fact that the market recognizes and penalizes nations that let their tax position to weaken?
In a Word, no.
Interest rates on sovereign debt in euro of the twelve Governments of the euro area are very similar.
The market does not seem to worry that countries have different potentials to generate exports financing the financial flow needed to repay the debts, or different ratios deficit / GDP current or projected.
Willem Buiter, of the University of Amsterdam and Anne Sibert, of the University of London, believe that it is the acceptance of the ECB of any deficit of eurozone as collateral that has undermined the will of the market to become the controller of fiscal moderation.
As long as the marginal part of the German debt is used as collateral for a loan in the short term, or as centerpiece of a repurchase transaction delivered to acquire cash, its value is much more likely to be determined by the terms according to which the ECB accepts it as a guarantee by its fundamental.
The treatment by the ECB of any debt of the kind as also important source of liquidity reserve false now any differential analysis of sovereign risk in the long term.
It is dangerous in the long term.
It is necessary to have both a market discipline and solid fiscal management to have a reasonable chance of stability of prices in the long term.
Today fail to punish the market behavior that can become case - neck or activate the institutional levers that give a voice to future generations, and you expose yourself to serious consequences - may not be today or tomorrow, but one day, and for the rest of your life.
As time passes, the arrival of the single currency and the way in which the euro has been implemented generate more discomfort.
The policy of the euro area in general is too deflationary.
Transfers necessary to make the current currency bearable to regions which slow or are already in recession when the ECB applies a policy more strict are not made.
The institutional foundations of a stable fiscal policy over the long term are in full erosion.
Now, Buiter and Sibert convince us that the ECB gives the market less opportunity to reward more efficient and to penalise the spenders as it should.
The Earth is not moving yet, and it will not happen before a time.
But the ground under the euro may become slippery if things do not change.
Milosevic and Hussein: trial, even farce.
The trial of war criminals were once serious business.
Remember - you photographs of Herman Goering and Rudolf Hess, sinister, on the dock at Nuremberg.
Some Nazi leaders were even hanged after relatively short but fair trials.
Nowadays, the trials of the world's most despicable leaders have become farce.
The trial of Saddam Hussein and his friends of the Baath party are an unbroken series of awkward moments.
Defendants seek a cricket after another and made Hussein shows all forms of possible contempt. The only thing he has not yet made, it is show his buttocks to the judge.
It is difficult to expect an outcome which might seem legitimate in the eyes of Iraqis or the world.
Meanwhile, the trial of Slobodan Milosevic changed itself in funeral after four boring years of testimony and spent $ 200 million unnecessarily.
In Cambodia, the United Nations and the Government have procrastinated for nearly ten years to learn how to bring surviving red Khmer personalities in the courts.
The mass killers who took power in the twentieth century was doomed to be killed in popular revolts or tried for their crimes - at least, if they were not dying during their tenure.
Who can feel proud that the last Communist leader of Romania, Nicolae Ceausescu, was executed with his wife without even the appearance of a fair trial?
Formal traps of a real court seem to be always preferable to instant justice, even if the final result is also death.
Today there are two plausible ways to proceed against a deposed tyrant.
A nation can send its former executives in the courts, as the Argentines did in the 1980s with the responsible generals of the disappearance over 5,000 of their fellow citizens.
At the international level, the model of Nuremberg remains valid as an example to other trial, although under the dubious conditions than the victorious powers sometimes ask accounts for certain crimes as "crimes against humanity", which are not correctly defined at the time they are committed.
There was a time where we could see the benefits of both national and international trials.
The trial on the national territory allowed the local community to give free rein to his grief by participating in the procedure.
As judges and jurors, the compatriots of the defendants could also bring greater sensitivity to the estimation of guilt because they could enjoy the harsh conditions under which a deposed dictator made its decisions.
The trial of the generals in Argentina has been a ritual a success under the painful transition from the military junta to democracy, but this experience ended in a tearful challenge.
Even after their conviction, the generals have been strong enough to require a denunciation of their trial and amnesty of the next president.
Argentine politics is still tangled in the legal consequences of these trial of twenty years ago.
Level international, the decision of the Security Council of the United Nations to establish the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (TPI) has also been hailed with great confidence.
The CFI has made several founding decisions under the direction of Antonio Cassese.
But then the judges had the misfortune to realize their fondest dream: judging the villain in leader, Slobodan Milosevic.
Cannot get a clear idea of how the Serbs would have considered Milosevic in a local trial.
Much would have depended on the political party that would have controlled the Court.
At the international level, fears were not about an excess of policy but on an excess of law.
Milosevic's trial has to be more than just, it had to be the emblem of the justice of the United Nations.
So Milosevic was allowed to defend him - even - mistake in terms of length and efficiency of trial.
There has not been a limits the number of people that the prosecution called as a witness on the same dreadful story of aggression and Serb brutality.
It will take many months to identify the problem and find out why this scandal of a trial of four years.
My hunch is that well-meaning officials of the tribunal were too influenced by the Commission of truth and reconciliation South - African model sold in the schools of law as a desirable alternative to distributive justice.
During the South - African trial, the most important issue was not the future of the accused but the past victims.
Each victim was encouraged to tell his story and listened to the accused.
In the case of massacres carried out in the twentieth century, such narratives can last for decades.
Encourage victims to speak and then give the accused the right to monopolize the floor and block the trial in touting its merits of political leader are the ingredients of a lengthy session.
One of the lessons that we have learned of Milosevic and Hussein trials is that do not judge men or women to make them lose their charismatic appeal.
They will flip the trial, particularly if they are allowed to defend them - same, and will use the courtroom to justify their routes.
Tyrants should be judged only after having been clearly defeated.
Ironically, the fact that the Nuremberg tribunal was facilitated by representatives of the winners and of the powerful was an advantage.
They were a constant reminder to Goering, Hess and their minions that the Allies ordered, that the Nazis were irretrievably vanquished.
Punish the guilty, rather than form how the story would be written, has always been the clear objective of the trial.
The tragedy of the Milosevic and Hussein trials is that the points on the "i" of history are still missing and that history - even is on the hot seat.
The consequent reluctance of policymakers gave birth to procedures, both national and international, that facilitated fantasies of justification and return.
In the case of Saddam Hussein, this fantasy could still be achieved.
The line of the Iraqi economy.
All those who analyze the Iraq see a nation divided between Shia, Sunni and Kurdish communities.
But there is another as fundamental division, a division that contributes as much to the ongoing insurrection as sectarian strife and opposition to military occupation led by Americans, that of the growing gap between the rich and the poor of Iraq.
When the Iraq was released, populations, particularly the poor, are taken to be hoped that a charismatic leader would save them from the harsh realities of daily life.
Raised in fear, they had no idea about the way in which democracy could apply to their company or how human rights groups and other civil rights organizations could help them shape their future.
The Iraq quickly found himself facing a new line of social sharing.
On one side were those who understand how to work in a democracy, come to power and carry out own ambitions.
They have learned to speak the language of democracy, at the same time earning money and influence, and to ensure the support of independent organizations to defend their rights and privileges.
On the other side, however, found a large population of Iraqis without power, including widows, divorced or abandoned without anyone to take them over, they and their children.
For those - here, democracy and human rights do not mean much.
They are uneducated, poor and sick.
Victims of an educational system that has collapsed more than a decade ago, they are poorly trained to find a job in the Iraqi economy into disrepair.
Under the yoke of Saddam, no effort was made to raise the level of life of the poor.
I visited the huge slums Iraqi and discovered families living in dwellings that are barely covered with a roof, infested insects everywhere, with sewers opened flowing under their doors.
Night and day, they live in the dark.
Needing nothing less than food, decent housing and job opportunities, these families await death, terrified by the cries of their starving children.
When I met women who live in these houses, they have bombed issues: democracy would - it give them food and houses?
Democracy would prevent - it men to beat their wives?
Democracy would - she citizenship to their children?
Give them - she the right to divorce spouses who have abandoned?
To all these questions, I replied 'Yes'.
Yes, democracy will grant you the right to live in a decent House, the right to learn and work, and it will grant citizenship to children and equality between men and women.
But you need to work hard to make all possible efforts to require these rights.
To which they replied: "Saddam has taught us to be unemployed, silent and fearful for 35 years.
What is can - us now? ".
These destitute areas where most Iraqis live populations are embroiled in bitter temptations.
There are many who are not in the scope of political or Government leaders.
They fall easily into violence, theft and sabotage.
Poverty led some to accept money in Exchange for terrorist acts, made accomplices by the promise of a false heroism that they could not operate during the long reign of Saddam.
Poverty has exacerbated the trauma of violent history of wars and the atrocities of the Iraq, which annihilated the sensitivity of people to the assassination.
Although the conditions of life in Iraq today leads many young men toward violence, I am convinced that simply provide them with jobs and decent housing to save.
Jobs, in particular, would help youth to forge new lives thanks to serious jobs.
Do not use bogus jobs to disguise the army of unemployed.
We must give the people of jobs that allow them to contribute positively to the reconstruction of the country.
By nature, each individual seeks to prove useful for his own company.
But the culture that Saddam created convinced Iraqis that political connections are the only way to acquire authority, money and knowledge.
Exceed such sentiments will take time and will require a flourishing economy, implying that the new Iraqi Government must have limited powers to facilitate the growth of the private sector while promoting understanding of democracy and human rights.
Religious groups are ready to participate in this process.
We also rehabilitate the technocrats who served under Saddam, so that they also have a chance to serve their country.
Last, but not least, we need to offer loans to poor families to help them build a respectable life.
The Government must by - above all making every effort to convince the poor Iraqi people of the value of democracy and freedom and the importance of the constitution in the realization of their aspirations for a better life.
It won't be easy to achieve in a country where many are those who consider that breaking the law is an act of heroism.
We have however, we, the Iraqis, learned that the power should not be concentrated in the hands of a minority, and that the establishment of justice requires to combat corruption in all its forms.
If the constitution is to function as a guarantee of democracy, freedom and security, the poor Iraqis must learn how to make their this fight.
The Islamist identity.
Where that you head your look at the present time, Islam is used (and misused) as a political force.
Some Muslims use it as incentive to action; many Muslims in the West (and in others) perceive it as an 'other' containment and demanding an 'other' exclusion.
As Turkish, I feel directly these two sides of the debate.
The reason why Islam resembles one religion of 'the other' in the eyes of Westerners is that the West has witnessed a systematic de-institutionalization of religion.
It is not religion that has disappeared from modern Western life, of course, but rather claims that religious institutions may issue on individual behaviour.
Religion in the modern world is more than ever a personal and spiritual experience.
However, a process of deinstitutionalization of religious experience occurs also within Islam.
The politicization of Islam supersedes the authority of the religious classes in Islam, the ulema.
As in the West, Islamic religious experience becomes more personal.
The interpretation of religious texts by individual Muslims, including political activists, intellectuals and women, is a consequence among many others.
Include the extension of religious knowledge, the teachings of the Koran being abused and taken out of context to support policy objectives.
Who decides now what is lawful and what is unlawful in Islam?
Who have sufficient authority to interpret religious texts?
Who can issue a fatwa or declare "jihad"?
Nowadays, activism and terrorism provide, or rather impose, a source of legitimacy.
So laymen decide what means or doesn't mean Islam, without the authority of religious schools and specialized training.
Indeed, Islam today is essentially interpreted by political actors and cultural movements, and not by religious institutions.
This deinstitutionalisation allowed Islam to move from the status of local social ties and national to creator of imaginary links between all Muslims around the world who feel oppressed or displaced.
Islamism can unite adherents who were deeply divided: Muslims intellectuals Sufis and Muslim canonized Shariat origin; Muslim Shiites and Sunnis; the conservative Saudi Arabia and revolutionary Iran.
Islam is also dynamic, its believers leaving rural areas for cities, including Western cities.
Many consider this movement as negative and point out that these individuals are socially uprooted and that they rock later in the disposition and, for some, terrorism.
But social mobility is also a precondition to create a modern perspective.
Of course, migration causes a sense of distance among Muslims, if not a total break from their social origins.
Their religious experience is so new, private theological, community or public institutions.
Religious experience becomes a form of social imagination within which they reconstruct a sense of belonging to Islam in a new and strange environment.
This is not the distance from modern life, but the proximity with this life that triggers a return to religious identity.
Indeed, the vast majority of radicalism is manifested in groups who, through their experience of mobility and displacement, are familiar with the secular Western modes of political thought and urban life.
Confused by unfamiliar surroundings, these individuals hang Islam which becomes their sole support.
But for this support work, Islam must free itself from its traditionally subservient, passive and docile attitude towards modernity.
By wearing a veil or a beard, claiming the right to obtaining of places of prayer at work or at school and by requiring special foods, Muslims openly identify themselves as Muslims.
They shall inform the world that they are more meticulous and more zealous in their religious observance than those who confine their religiosity to private life.
For example, non-Muslims generally consider the wearing of the veil as a sign of debasement and inferiority of Muslim women.
Shame, it has however become for Muslims a sign of their positive affirmation of an Islamist identity.
Young Muslim women in Europe illustrate this transformation to perfection.
Young girls who adopt the headscarf in French and German schools are closer, in many aspects (namely, the youth culture, fashion awareness and language), their classmates and their uneducated mothers who are forced to stay at home.
By adopting the headscarf for the European public sphere, these young girls change without wanting the symbol and the role of Muslim women.
This trend goes well to the - beyond of simple scarves.
All Western Muslims possess a double sense of belonging, a double cultural capital.
They define themselves by their religiosity, but they also acquired universal secular knowledge.
They have this cultural capital double, they can circulate relatively freely between the different activities and spaces (home, school, youth and urban recreation area).
Being Muslim and being Islamist are two different things.
We are today witnessing a Muslim identity for an Islamist identity change.
The religious for individual Muslims me passes the Kingdom private to the public realm.
The question that remains for each is whether this search for identity can be satisfied with scarves and with a wide public acceptance of religious practice Islamist or if a positive affirmation of Islam requires a more fundamental renunciation of modernity.
A new era for Islamic science?
For several hundred years, while the science and mathematics were enjoying a period of great inventiveness, a region of the world differed from others.
The masters of these disciplines were revered, medicine progressed rapidly, and people questioned on the functioning of the nature.
Surprising that this region has been globally respected.
In the other half of the known world, scientists were punished, even killed.
Mathematics, regarded as irreligious and foreign, were off - the - Act, and were later enslaved to the religion.
The standard of living was low.
The prosperous region was the Middle East Islamic, while an ignorant Europe remained poor.
The two regions were governed religiously (historians do not agree on the role and the nature of religions in this context), but science flourished only in one of them.
Today, of course, the roles of Middle - East Islamic and Western are reversed.
Since the second world war, the States - United are the unquestioned global leaders in the field of science.
Throughout this period, the brightest students have attracted outside their country of origin by the prospect of better opportunities of career and research.
Until recently, more than half graduate students of superior in mathematics, science and engineering to the States - United were born abroad.
Many of these young talents stayed after obtaining their degree, and both the industrial world that the Government have benefited profit.
Meanwhile, Islamic culture entered a historical phase in which science was equated with the influence of the West, and eschewed for that very reason.
Even in countries where oil revenues could support a significant proportion of research, Arab leaders have not encouraged such investments, and the consequence is that their societies have not prospered as much as they could have.
Recently, an aspiration to greater political respect has pushed the Islamic nations to invest in the technology field, which is especially visible in Pakistani and Iranian nuclear ambitions.
But while such weapons have political weight, the science on which they are based is banal and old.
From compliance with considered visions, rather than born discoveries past, is far more meaningful.
Imagine the influence that would have a Pakistani Institute at the head of the global research on cancer.
And the political rhetoric would change - it if researchers in Oman discovered a way to eliminate AIDS?
This opportunity does not for the moment.
But there is another, which is not limited to Islamic societies.
States - United have committed serious fake - not recently.
"Matters of faith" substituted for science within the Government, from the Presidency.
Prominent researchers have seen their modified reports by members of staff - political when the facts contradicted the official version.
Encouraged by a Government influenced by religion, school systems are trying to divert their teaching of science to 'values'.
Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, entry visas are fewer and more difficult to obtain, which slows the flow of young talent to American universities.
Major scientific organizations have protested without result.
At the same time, tax laws have been revised to make the richest investors in the short term, discouraging long-term investment in research.
A half - trillion dollars was spent on the war in Iraq, an amount roughly equal to the financing of all basic research of the last thousand years.
Even if States - United avoid a dark age of fundamentalism, they clearly risk losing their world domination in terms of research.
The Japan acknowledged the link between political weight and science in the 1980s.
The main Japanese industrialist, Akio Morita, Sony's CEO, and the politician's right Shintaro Ishihara, made a series of speeches that have been compiled and published in 1986 as The Japan that Can Say No (the Japan that can say no).
They have outlined a national strategy in which global influence would result from the scientific power.
The main idea is that military power could be made obsolete if the "food chain" of military technology was controlled by other nations.
The title of the book refers to the project of the Japan to "say no" to military American influence once the Japan mastered the key military technologies.
Build an economy based on knowledge thanks to oil wealth is quite possible.
For example, Texas as most of the States of the southern States - United, was once economically poor and declining.
Even with oil revenues, the flow of dollars into the economy, by itself, is not enough to boost prosperity as much as you might think.
Texas has decided to spend oil money on an Endowment for education.
Today, this allocation is roughly equal to that of Harvard University, and it extends to 15 universities.
She has had a staggering effect: the aerospace industry has almost disappeared from California, but it explodes in Texas.
Research centres and telecommunications consortia rushed to Texas, to the Canadian Nortel telecommunications giant.
Although the industry suffers from a crisis in the States - United, Texas has one of the strongest industrial economies of the world.
There's no reason that the same results can be achieved in the Middle East.
But above all, the Islamic world must rediscover and reconcile itself with its proud heritage.
The Iranian debate on the Iraq.
No country in the Middle East following the events of the after - war of Iraq as closely as the Iran.
Geographical proximity, a story intense and violent war with Saddam Hussein's Iraq, religious and emotional connections with the Shiites of Iraq, some concern as regards the States - United and their policy in the region: these are the sons that unite the Iran to its western neighbor.
Given the tensions without end with America, the Iran is particularly concerned by the possibility of a continued American presence in its neighbour, as well as by the dominant role of America in the construction of the future of the Iraq of the after - Saddam.
Foreign observers may find it difficult to follow the internal Iranian debates, yet they exist, they are intense, even though they are not always visible to the general international public.
We can identify three general approaches in the evolving Iranian debate on the Iraq of the after - Saddam.
Iranian pragmatists argue that the Iran must inevitably cooperate with States - United in the Iraq of the after - Saddam, even if it is only to ensure that the rights of the Shia population of Iraq are respected.
For this reason, the Iran should gain assurance that the new Iraqi leader is not hostile to him and seek to win bilateral friendships.
Other essential considerations for pragmatists concern the preservation of Iraqi territorial integrity and repatriation of tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees living in Iran.
They are moderates who believe that the Iranian Government should urge the States - United to obtain the extradition of members of the Organization of the Mujahideen Khalq (MKO) based in Iraq, as well as the dismantling of the organization.
In Exchange, the Iranian Government should provide support to ensure peace, stability and security in Iraq.
In sum, the pragmatists would limit relations americano - Iranian, concentrating them on a program that greatly reflects the internal concerns of the Iran.
In general, the conservative forces of Iran support this approach.
Another approach offers a more active and cooperative role in the Iran in the Iraq reconstruction.
Advocates of this position argue that the Iran is well positioned to facilitate reconstruction, because of its well-established infrastructure of personal and institutional links with the Iraq.
Finally, we think, the - United States and the international community will recognize the value of Iranian cooperation.
Iranian cooperation should be rewarded by the dismantling of the infrastructure of the MKO in Iraq, perhaps in Exchange for an Iranian pledge to tackle the activities of Al-QaÃ¯da, as well as to expel members of Al Qaeda of Iran.
Above all, the Iran should invite the Americans to respond to its cooperation with the assurance of a guarantee in return that the Iran does not in the future become the target of American military action.
In short, advocates of cooperation call for an open and explicit market: the support of Iran for stability during the current transition as well as its commitment to maintain relations of cooperation with all permanent government which will emerge in Iraq in Exchange for the improvement of regional and international of the Iran position.
This position is widely shared within the reform movements in Iran, breast and outside of the Government, as well as by the technocratic class and business orientation is more international.
Finally, for the Iranian radicals, the possibility of cooperation with the States - United remains pure fantasy.
They are convinced that America seeks to undermine Iranian security and jeopardize its national interests.
According to the radicals, the States - United will seek at least to impose significant changes in Iranian foreign policy.
At worst, say - they, America will seek to impose a change of regime in Iran of actively.
It will advocate with enthusiasm against the Iran nuclear knowledge and energy acquisition and could even attempt to weaken the military capability of the Iran as a whole.
Radicals perceive the American invasion of Iraq as a reflection of the American desire to encircle the Iran.
In return, they think that the Iran must adopt an aggressive stance in defence of its interests, by forming strategic alliances with the Russia and other regional powers and use Iranian influence in Iraq to prevent the formation of a pro - American and anti - Iranian Government in Baghdad.
Proponents of the hardliners on all sides support this approach.
The overthrow of Saddam and his regime was that the easiest aspect of the Iraq crisis.
Now the hardest is to: establish the peace and security, winning the war against terrorism, and convince the Muslim masses that America has no intention to occupy the Iraq to siphon off all of its oil resources and redraw the Middle East in his image.
Meanwhile, the opposition against the United States - United, under the expression of suicide bomb or other forms of terrorism, will probably only grow.
The Iran is intended to keep its important position in the region through its political dynamism and its Muslim identity which echo resounds throughout the Muslim world.
What is happening in Iraq has major implications in Iran and the States - United would do well to find a way to recognize this fact.
American threats, or discussions on another war, feed the fire of resentment and frustration in Iran, strengthening the most radical movements.
If the States - United wish to avoid such effects, they must agree to limit their influence of its own radicals, assuming that American interests in Iraq are better defended through cooperation with the Iran.
An issue for the Iraq.
The situation in Iraq has reached the point where everyone ostensibly wants the same thing: the departure of coalition forces.
The recent disclosure of a confidential memo from the Ministry of defence on the withdrawal of troops underlines this aspiration.
The only question is to know how to satisfy.
As long as the Coalition forces remain, violence will only increase.
However, if they leave, the escalation of violence will take place anyway, and more quickly.
The real question is how to achieve in Iraq to organize an army and a police force which can be trusted to enforce the law and order.
It remains some way to go to approach this goal.
Despite the courage of many Iraqis who join the ranks of the police or the army, wouldnt person that some people have motivations less than pure.
In the North of the Iraq, set old scores and ethnic segregation is introduced in some traditionally mixed areas, such as Irbil.
In other regions, the sharia is imposed.
How can the Iraq - it create bodies likely to enforce the law with effectiveness and impartiality, regardless of ethnicity, religion or gender?
The traditional answer is to recruit, train, and teach "good values".
But insufficient time.
Need to find other ways.
In the absence of a deeply rooted value system, Iraq needs rooted associations in civil society, in which the police and army accountability.
They could take various forms, but the most important is that they are really extended to the local level, and that they have the support of the district authorities, the region and the country when they report abuse.
If a local monitoring is implemented, completed and recognized at the national level, while most of the members of the military and police forces behave probably appropriately, and in the contrary case, it will be easier to identify and manage.
Such measures may appear overly optimistic, and yet, in Afghanistan, a country that resembles the Iraq in many ways, many groups work as well.
Cooperation for Peace and Unity (CPAU) provides a model of how to operate.
In Afghanistan, as in Iraq, the priority of ordinary people was to reduce violence.
The CPAU worked across the country over the past three years to implement the peace committees at the level of the districts, supported by satellite peace councils in the villages.
This initiative faces a culture in which violence is so deeply embedded that children, at a time, learned arithmetic by counting the dead Soviet soldiers.
The committees have therefore tried to gather all the groups of the community, including teachers, tribal leaders, religious leaders, women, police, judges and businessmen, to develop ways of resolving conflicts without violence.
Even if the committees were not officially playing a role of control so far (it is planned in the future), the mere fact that the police, the army and justice do part puts them in contact with the rest of the community, provides feedback, and contributes to the establishment of relationships of trust.
Some results are remarkable.
In one of the workshops, the local military commander came to spend a few hours out of courtesy, and ended up staying all week.
He went in apologizing for his violent past and pledged to disarm his private army of 2,000 men.
He visited today regularly at the offices of the Committee.
In Iraq, projects such as the Humanitarian Liaison Center of Kirkuk are beginning to perform a monitoring function by offering to the population to various ethnic groups the opportunity to expose his grievances and obtain assistance to resolve its problems.
But, too often, even in the case of a trial, the judgment did not apply because victims yield to the threat.
U.S. and British forces have already worked to strengthen civil society.
However, we do not intend to talk workshops of emancipation of women, or the success of the organisation of local elections on a small scale in the country.
Mobilize civil society represents a huge challenge, particularly when, as in Iraq, this must be done quickly and on a large scale.
Military forces remain necessary, but just as much as encouragement to disarmament, which can take the form of prospects for more fruitful than crime and theft economic opportunities..
Fortunately, such an organization of civil society is as inexpensive as important.
The Humanitarian Liaison Center association deals with all Kirkuk at an annual cost of US $75,000.
With $ 10 million, could be put in place about a hundred centres of the same kind, and it would remain the currency.
It must now engage in this direction, support without fail the courageous people who challenge hold accountable power.
Otherwise, the Iraqi people risk not knowing the security which he desperately needs after so many years of suffering.
Democracy on the Nile?
The decision surprised by Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak to propose a constitutional amendment authorizing the holding of direct and competitive presidential elections may well constitute a giant step for democracy in Egypt and the Arab world.
Westerners accustomed to a pluralistic democracy may have trouble understanding what potentially significant change this decision will result in a country accustomed to military rule for more than 50 years.
Under the current system, Egyptian citizens can only occur the day of a presidential referendum every six years to say yes or no to the only name appearing on the presidential election.
This explains why someone like Mubarak always received more than 90% of the vote, although in the midst of an indifferent participation rate.
Syrian and Iraqi strongmen have made even better with this system, no doubt because they demanded that the names and addresses of electors are placed at the bottom of each ballot.
Several individuals argue for a long time that democratization in the Middle - East will not progress as long as Egypt will not fully involved in the process.
Egypt could not actually embark on a path of democratization without first amending its constitution, this in order to reduce the Pharaonic powers of its president and limit the duration of its mandate.
Mubarak, after all, is already in his 24th year as president.
Thus, his announcement of competitive presidential elections is a first major step.
The regime may assume that it will be able to use the process to his advantage, but events could prove to be more difficult to control than once expected that citizens would begin to feel empowered.
The democratic genie is out of the bottle.
In any case, Egypt is not the only country in this troubled region to embark on the path of democracy.
The Turkey on one side of the Middle - East and Morocco on the other are already engaged in this process.
The real groundswell this time - seems above result from the temporal proximity and the positive results of the recent elections which were held in Iraq, in Palestine and, to a lesser extent, in Saudi Arabia.
The unprecedented demonstrations against the occupation of Lebanon by Syria after the assassination of its former Prime Minister, Rafiq al - Hariri, show not abating.
Egyptian opposition groups also staged increasingly bold marches and other forms of civil disobedience in recent weeks.
The catalyst for their anger was the arrest and detention of the leader of the sick opposition, Ayman Nour, late January.
The arbitrary attitude of the Government has reinvigorated the national movement Kifaya (which means "Enough"), which demanded the end of the Mubarak regime.
Suddenly, the popular wisdom that wants that the Egyptians are passive and afraid to act appeared more occur.
An alliance of local, regional and international forces unite against permanent tyranny exercised on the banks of the Nile.
The recent wave of popular pressure appears to have shaken the regime.
Only a month ago Muybarak ousted calls for constitutional reform by taxing them "futile".
But, whatever the combination of events that led to this turnaround, election initiative should be welcomed.
It is a necessary first step, although not enough to overhaul the political system stagnant of Egypt.
The Egyptians are already wary of symbolic reforms to the Tunisian, country in which president Zine El Abidin Bin Ali, occupying its functions for a long time, has created a caricature of constitutional amendment that appeared to pave the way for competitive presidential elections, but subsequently resulted in a sham contest with some "opponents" sorted on the pane.
In the previous Tunisian presidential referenda, Bin Ali routinely harvested 99% of the votes; has now got 96%.
Expect Mubarak to be more serious about electoral reform.
To prove his sincerity, it must order the immediate release of Ayman Nour and take measures to put an end to the State of emergency of 24 years, which prevents successful political campaigns.
Mubarak must also approve a limit of two successive terms of five years for each president.
As necessary, of measures to win the confidence of the citizens, including an open and equal access to the media, which are currently controlled by the State.
I announced that I intended to play this upcoming presidential election in order to open the debate on these essential reforms.
But I will return with pleasure to my life of citizen private when I have the assurance of a free and open election next fall.
If they are seriously implemented, these steps will transform the legacy of Mubarak.
With the events in the Lebanon, Iraq and Palestine, they could very well inaugurate an Arab spring of freedom, waited for a very long time.
Historic elections for the Egypt?
Egyptians will go to the polls on 7 September to elect a president from among 10 candidates, including Mubarak, in power for 24 years.
If little doubt that he will be re-elected at the end of the election, many follow the steps with passion.
Some 6,000 domestic electoral observers have been trained for the occasion, and hundreds of international observers will arrive in the country this week.
Although all the trappings of a real electoral competition are put in place, it is striking that several signs of authenticity missing.
Despite promises to the contrary, the playing conditions are far from fair.
Mubarak enjoys a disproportionate number of advantages: the recognition of the name, a quasi - monopoly of electronic media controlled by the State and nothing less than 85% of the print media.
A week before polling, some opposition candidates not yet had the opportunity to disseminate a single campaign on Egyptian television.
All members of the presidential electoral commission are appointed by Mubarak, and the new election rules eliminated all independent competitors.
Since 2000, a decision of the Supreme Court stipulates that 8,000 Egyptian judges must supervise elections and certifying the results.
It is a big step towards fairer elections, because the Professional Union of judges remained fairly independent over the last half - century of control over the Executive power.
Mubarak's regime has therefore had to use various subterfuges to neutralize the Union of judges.
One of them was to stretch the definition of "judicial" to include thousands of employees qualified in law, without experience in the Court but loyal to the Government. This leaves little room for real judges, because if they protest by boycotting their observation work, the task will return once more to the infamous Ministry of the Interior police.
Thus, in the past, the Union of judges is acquitted of his task, with predictable results.
During parliamentary elections of 2000, while the ruling party of Mubarak received that approximately 38% of the vote in areas monitored by real judges, the results managed to peak at 86% when the almost - judges were in charge of the observation.
This year promises to be very different.
In the spring, the judges held a meeting of national magnitude and resolved that unless the Government granted full independence and exclusive monitoring of the election process, it would not control the presidential (or parliamentary) election to come.
On 2 September, they exhibited their ultimate requirement: the regime must allow a civilian groups to observe the conduct of the elections, stop changing the definition of legitimate judges for electoral purposes, and accept no urn leaves the presence of a judge legitimate unless its contents counted, certified and postponed.
For now it seems that the situation is hopeless, as the head of the presidential electoral commission publicly announced on Egyptian television that he refused any comments by citizens in the conduct of the elections.
Among the interesting developments on the eve of the election is a heated public debate on the theme: be - it boycott the election or to vote?
Of many opposition parties have called their members to abstain to protest against restrictive electoral rules that strongly favor Mubarak.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood, considered the only opposition group with weight in Egypt, pushing their supporters to vote according to their conscience but not supporting an any "governing despotic and corrupt".
This is a repudiation implied but clear of Mubarak, only head of State for 24 years.
Some 34 civil society organizations prepare thousands of young Egyptians to monitor the elections despite repeated governmental objections.
These groups argue that if the regime does not have the intention to rig the elections, then the presence of national and international observers should not be a problem.
The response of the regime is to say that any external oversight is an interference in Egyptian sovereignty, and that domestic observers would be an affront to the integrity of the judges.
This last argument quickly fell when the Union of judges ruled in favour of civil society observers.
That Mubarak's regime afraid of inside and outside voices that put the challenge to hold elections free and fair, or that it is simply unable to remove the cheat in the party so much it has become inherent in its operation, the current signs don't bode well as the returning officer for next Wednesday.
Meanwhile, for the first time Egyptians are the exciting experience of the challenge the tyranny, and enjoy a whole new area of freedom.
The European desire to the dollar.
Currency can play an essential role not only in commercial transactions, but also in the diplomatic and political disputes.
When this happens, commercial transactions become more difficult and subject to greater uncertainty.
The politicization of money during the depression of between it - two - wars proved to be economically devastating.
But violent wars currencies have occurred more recently.
During the 1960s, the international monetary order became the subject of a fierce political struggle.
Each protagonist had theories and significantly different explanations of the situation.
Europeans, and in particular the French, complained of general Charles de Gaulle termed "exorbitant privilege" of the U.S. dollar.
The general and his monetary guru, Jacques Rueff, argued that States - United used the status of the dollar as the currency of major reserve of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate regime to manage deficits and pay their overseas military adventurism (at that time in the Viet Nam).
The France reacted by calling a monetary reform which put an end to the special role of the dollar and attempted to resurrect the standard now widely discredited.
Europeans began a lengthy discussion on the advantages of the monetary union, whose implementation would allow them to compete with the dollar.
But from the U.S. point of view, the international role of the dollar was a trap.
Other countries could change their exchange rates and were thus able to maintain greater competition to the level of exports.
The U.S. Government has proved impotent against a yen under - rated, fueling the belief that the rest of the world was using the dollar to attack the American manufacturing base.
The Nixon administration concluded that the only way to save the American economy was to engage in monetary unilateralism (a money-growth so spectacular that other countries would be forced to adjust their exchange rates).
These long-forgotten battles seem suddenly very present again.
The world has more than one fixed exchange rate regime, but the dollar remains the currency of major reserve, a sort of floating Bretton Woods.
For Americans, the role of the dollar reserve constitutes a threat potential while for non-Americans, it would be rather another example of quest neo - imperial American for hegemony.
During this decade, China took the place of the Japan of the early 1960s, preventing its exchange rate to climb in order to push the growth of exports.
This has made her the target of the U.S. complaints about unfair competition and efforts to impose an adjustment of exchange rates likely to dissuade the Americans to buy toys, appliances and Chinese clothes.
American manufacturers have estimated that supports - throat made in China were threatening the American way of life.
Between - time Europeans (and particularly the French) complain about huge deficits Americans and the argument of de Gaulle stating that the rest of the world pay for the wars of America is again fashionable.
Some Europeans suggest that Asian central banks should hold a greater proportion of their reserves in euro, an echo of the unsuccessful attempt by the general to capitulate America by selling dollars for gold.
The 1960s ended by a collapse of the 'system' and a financial turmoil major, accompanied by an inflationary wave of prices of goods.
Everything everyone has been affected and the role of America on the world stage has been shaken.
A similar collapse should currently have a substantially different effect.
The current floating rate system is more stable and the costs of adjustment differently distributed.
The majority of Americans do not suffer many of the sharp fall of the dollar because foreign vendors should make adjustments of prices for the American market.
Asian economies are development vigorously and their banks their plants rely on States - United.
They should continue this policy to not see their export sectors undergo a failure suddenly in the crucial U.S. market.
States - United will have more time to deal with a current account deficit that does is prove to be unsustainable in the long term.
The economically dynamic regions of the world (North America and Asia) are thus linked by a pact that will ensure the continuity of the centrality of the U.S. dollar.
The Americans will continue to accumulate debt because Asians them promote.
The repeal of the Covenant would be contrary to the interest of both parties.
This is not American unilateralism as the Pact involves collaboration with Asia.
But for Europeans, who are excluded from the Pact, the Pact looks like monetary and economic unilateralism.
Between - time supremacy of the euro on the dollar suffered European industrial exporters.
However, Europe is not able to relieve them.
Europe will in fact represent the greatest victim of the new currency clashes.
The answers forecasted in the 1960s (recovery of the standard gold or invention of a common European currency) seem more useful.
A single currency did not provide substantial protection.
The old version of the European reaction (what psychologists call "dollar envy") will become only more penetrating.
The European Central Bank will be asked to expand the monetary base, as if the imitation of the dollar was the answer to all industrial, structural and demographic problems which invade Europe.
But we should remember that Europe's problems are not manipulating currency.
The protests against the new version of the exorbitant monetary privilege of America must be seen for what they are: a way to compensate for a real European powerlessness.
The dollar envy is therefore ready to disappear and it will intensify the international value of the dollar disappearing without clearly adverse effects on the people who print it and use it.
An epidemic of policy.
The Americans, as citizens of all countries of the world, have come to accept that politics plays an important role in the appointment of certain kinds of public representatives.
Few of us are surprised (although some may be disappointed) when a federal judge or a senior diplomat is named because he managed a crucial test of fidelity to an important principle in the eyes of the party of the president or the Prime Minister.
But science, in the opinion of all, occupies a place apart and on this point, the States - United are beginning to serve as an example of warning for the rest of the world.
Scientific appointments must be based on objective criteria of training, competence and performance.
Evidently, it is legitimate to interrogate a future Secretary of health and Human Services (SSH) on his views on abortion.
But it is totally inappropriate to submit candidates to sit in scientific advisory committees to tests of political loyalty.
Similarly, belonging to organizations considering the scientific proposals, a fundamental process for scientific progress, should no doubt be freed from all barriers that are unrelated to professional qualifications.
Unfortunately, scientists at the States - United more often encounter these barriers.
During last fall, the journal Science published several stories on the issue.
One of these reports dealt with the massive replacement of members of the Advisory Committee of the national Center for environmental health, which is part of the Centre for prevention and control of diseases (CDC), without prior consultation with the Director of the centre.
Similar cases have also been observed in the Advisory Committee on Lead Poisoning and Prevention in CDC, the Advisory Committee on National Human Research Protections and the Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing.
The current epidemic of ideology, in which advisory committees are dissolved and then reformed with new members, and where the candidates are subjected to loyalty tests, seems outdated to some observers.
Representatives of the SSH spoke as of a "fairly common practice".
This is not a common practice in America, or at least not until today.
In all cases, the fact that the Bush Administration will allow tests to candidates in key positions to determine their compatibility with its 'values' is not really disturbing.
The most alarming development focuses on the degree of importance of ideological inquiries, that interfere in areas so far - there immune to this kind of manipulation.
In fact, the most telling in this growing political epidemic case has can - be concerned the redesign of the belonging to the study section of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, which evaluates grants for the study of injuries in the workplace.
Advisory Committees could be vulnerable to a casual reworking of this type in the past.
After all, they recommended policies regardless of whether politicians take into consideration.
But the study sections?
In October 2002, Science published an editorial by David Michaels and several of his colleagues.
Many of them were former officials distinguished who participated in some of the relevant committees and they have made a point of view valuable question, based on their personal experience.
Their article was a case on him - even, but the consequences he had were still more interesting.
He triggered a volley of letters in which scientists talked about similar experiences.
A candidate for Muscular Dystrophy Research Coordinating Committee of the national Institute of Health said that a survey was conducted on it by a member of the White House.
After being invited to discuss his views on the various policies of the Bush Administration, which none of them had any link with the work of the Committee, she had to indicate if it supported the policy of the president on embryonic stem cells.
Another person to be manifested, a distinguished Psychiatry and psychology professor told having received a call from the White House concerning his appointment to the National Council on Drug Abuse.
His interlocutor said it should inquire into it in order to "determine whether his views could embarrass the president".
According to the Professor, a series of questions ensued, the representative of the White House holding a scorecard.
Example: "you got two out of three; the president is opposed to the exchange of needles (for intravenous drug users) for moral reasons, regardless of the result. "."
Then the conversation took a turn even more alarming.
The representative asked the candidate if he had voted for Bush, and after receiving a negative answer, he asked: "why did - you step supported president?".
This attitude is akin to a dictatorship, not a democracy.
The objective of the scientific advisory committees is to provide impartial and thoughtful in the political process advice.
There is nothing to gain, and much to lose, when a desired political outcome is put forward.
It is the reason for which the determination of research projects to support has always been a question to be considered objectively by peers, and not by politicians.
In fact, the law that applies here (the Act on federal advisory committees, the Federal Advisory Committee Act) requires explicitly that committees are impartial and "non-influenced inappropriately by the authority with the power of appointment".
The U.S. Secretary of health and Human Services Tommy Thompson and the White House personnel office should set an example to the rest of the world.
They can do this very easily: in accordance with the law.
Murder in Moscow.
It is time to put an end to the fiction that the "dictatorship of the law" by Vladimir Poutine visited the post - Communist Russia a both itself little more law-abiding.
The murder of Anna PolitkovskaÃ¯a, one journalists among the best and the most courageous of Russia, a woman who dared to update the brutal murders committed by Russian soldiers in Chechnya, is the ultimate proof that president Poutine directs that a banal dictatorship demonstrating the ordinary contempt of the law.
It is time for the rest of the world to recognise this, particularly for Europe.
The German Ministry of Foreign Affairs is preparing a policy on the relationship between the Russia and Germany, which is expected to endorse the indifference to a lack of respect for the law shown by Putin as the most powerful member of the European Union national interest.
But indifference becomes the conciliation when it encourages Putin to continue on this path in the international arena, as evidenced by his current campaign to economically strangle the Georgia.
The murder of Politkovskaya has a grim taste of already - seen: just as in the days of glory of the KBG, in Putin's Russia people disappear, simply.
The murder of Politkovskaya is the third apparently political murder in three weeks.
Enver Ziganshin, Chief Engineer of BP Russia, was shot in Irkutsk on September 30.
Andrei Kozlov, vice - governor of the Central Bank of Russia, who led a campaign against financial fraud, was assassinated on 14 September.
The fact that the Attorney general of Russia Yury Chaika take the investigation on the murder of Politkovskaya in hand, as he has done for Kozlov, is not source of hope, as would be the case in a true democracy if an officer is involved in an investigation.
In fact, involvement of the highest levels of the Government in Russia is practically an insurance that the murderer will never be found.
The murder of Politkovskaya is a particularly sinister omen considering the fact that it issued virulent criticism against the Russian president.
In his articles for one of the few still independent newspapers Moscow, Novaya Gazeta, and in his books "Putin Russia: life in a failing democracy" and "dirty war: a Russian reporter in Chechnya" Politkovskaya said the removal of freedoms which sign Putin's Presidency.
As shown in the fate of the former businessmen exiled Boris Berezovski and Vladimir Gusinki, and that of Mikhail Khodorkovsky imprisoned oil magnate, the fate of the enemies of Putin may take three forms: exile, prison or the grave.
I'm not currently accusing Putin's Government of having ordered the murder of Politkovskaya.
After all, as a journalist in the field, it enraged many other people besides Putin, including the current Chechen Prime Minister Ramzan Kadyrov is not least, whom she accused of pursuing a policy of kidnapping for ransom.
But even if Vladimir Poutine Associates had nothing to do with the murder of Politkovskaya shot in an elevator of her Central Moscow building, its flouting of the law has created the climate in which the murder was committed.
The image of the murder of Thomas Beckett in his Canterbury Cathedral many centuries ago, the crime was committed with the clear conviction that the King would be satisfied.
Given that represented Politkovskaya - the responsibility of a democratic press to question the Kremlin and its policies - the Government should ensure that nothing to happen.
Putin's Russia has already lost 12 prominent journalists murdered over the past six years.
None of these crimes has been solved, which would not be the case if the "dictatorship of the law" of Putin was anything more than a simple public relations strategy.
The six years that have elapsed since the arrival of Vladimir Poutine in the Kremlin were marked by deeply contradictory signals.
On one side, the world sees a young graduate leader commit to modernize the Russia, and particularly to align the law enforcement and judicial practices on international standards.
The other hand, the president merely to watch without saying anything while his former colleagues of the Russian security service of the FSB (the former KGB) absolutely do not protect those who murder, and even to launch a series of espionage cases infamous against journalists, scientists and environmental activists.
Among these "neo - spies" include journalist Gregori Pasko, arms control expert Igor Soutiagine, diplomat Valentin MoiseÃ¯ev, physicist Valentin Danilov and many others.
The supposedly civilizing influence that involves being a Western partner, chairing a Summit of the G8 in Saint Petersburg, for example, seems to count for nothing in the cabal of Putin's Kremlin.
Once more, the contact with the values of the West gave birth to an another Potemkin village; the Russia has a faÃ§ade of laws and democratic rules, but behind this dÃ©cor of cardboard - pulp are the same butes arbitrary who act.
At the global level, the danger is that the non - respect of the laws shown by Putin is exported.
Near the Russian borders, a form of criminalized diplomacy is trying to take root.
Think how Putin has tried to rig the elections in Ukraine, and accusations without diploma worn and removed against the leader of the opposition Yulia Tymoshenko.
Consider the secessionist regions playing Franks - shooters in Georgia and Moldova, which exist only because they have the support of the Kremlin.
Watch as the Kremlin seeks to blackmail its neighbours by threatening their energy supplies.
All police officers know that when we ignore the behavior of criminals, those - ci don't become that bolder.
It is high time that the world recognizes Vladimir Poutine for what it is: a man who brings back the Russia to the land of shadows.
The world must now ponder this old Latin maxim that tacet consentere videtur: who is silent consents, and wonder if it is really wise to quietly consent to the construction by Putin of a superpower energy where the law does not count.
A pipeline to strengthen the Russia Empire.
Gerhard SchrÃ¶der who, less than a month ago, was still Chancellor agreed to become President of the company responsible for the construction of a gas pipeline linking the Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea and Western Europe.
In many countries, Schroeder would be easily accused of the offence of conflict of interest.
His apparent moral failure is magnified by the fact that at the same time, the Russia threatens to stop the supply of gas to the Ukraine if celle - ci does not yield to the tariff requirements of Gazprom, the giant gas State of Kremlin property.
The strategic objective of the Russia is clear. Currently, no longer distribute gas to the Ukraine also means that much of Europe will be more stocked, because most major gas pipelines through the Ukraine.
Bypassing Ukraine, the Poland and, of course, the Baltic States, the new pipeline will strengthen the influence of the Kremlin which seeks again to prevail in the region.
President Vladimir Poutine and his Government of ex - KGB clones will no longer have to worry about the reactions of Western Europe when they decide how firmly put pressure on neighboring post - Communists of the Russia.
Europe should - it actually provide Putin with a such imperialist weapon?
Worse still, the Russia must - it use this weapon to EU energy boot?
A former German Chancellor to take the direction of the company that will provide the Russia the way to manipulate the European economy reflects the dangerous sufficiency of Europe and the neo - imperialist ambitions of Putin.
Of course, the Russian media are aware of the growing dependence of Europe by reports to the energy resources of the Russia.
They go so far to delight. Russian commentators have written "When we will have integrated and amplified our energy trade with Europe, it will have to remain silent on the issue of human rights.".
Putin expressed this position in a more oblique manner as if committing to pursue what he calls a "policy of independence.".
So, wants to - he just say that the Russia must remain "independent" of the concerns of Western democracies on ethics and human rights.
It is possible that some European leaders actually believe that fresh EU prosperity maintaining justifies that we keep silent about the rights of man and of the other themes that anger the Kremlin.
Of course, we must briefly speak on "commercial" matters, as the expropriation of Yukos. However, if the Kremlin were to monetize our values or our mind criticism towards him - as about the bloody Chechnya - it would seem that Europeans prefer to remain silent only to face a potential increase in energy prices or even a blockade, as the Ukraine is currently facing.
While Putin reorganizes its court, subjecting the Duma to his will, the EU hopes to see the Russia become more and more "European" should be abandoned.
The Russia that Putin is building gradually turned. She has abandoned his hopes of freedom post - Soviet to become an oil and gas bulwark favourable to the new ex - KGB elite.
Indeed, Matthias Warnig, the Director of the consortium of the pipeline chaired by SchrÃ¶der, is a longtime Putin friend.
A little earlier in the year, the Wall Street Journal revealed that Warnig, the Director of the Russian's Dresdner Bank arm, is an ex - officer in the Stasi, the old police secret of the East Germany, and he met with Putin at the end of the 1980s while the Russian President was spy of the KGB in the GDR.
That the Russians accept a Government formed of former KGB men, for which the lack of compassion and the refusal of dissent are the rule, reflects their exhaustion toward the tumult over the last twenty years.
Now, the Kremlin considers that what is good for the Russians of basic it is also for citizens of independent nations. No mercy will be given to small weak countries once the Russia will hold the means to intimidate them, isolate them and threaten them with energy blockade.
As a former head of State of the new independent Lithuania, I have often faced such threats.
The European Union has signed numerous agreements with the Russia, including those concerning a "common area" of freedom and justice.
The Kremlin is very strong to pretend such idealism.
Its control over Eastern Europe has always been imposed on the basis of "treaties of friendship" and the Soviet invasions of Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 were "fraternal" missions.
But, look how Putin violates this "common" space: barbaric treatment of Chechens, the imprisonment of businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky, harassment of foreign NGOs and the charge of Yuliya Tymoshenko, one of the faces of the Revolution orange, by the Russian on completely fabricated charges military judges.
If Europeans believe sincerely in their common area of freedoms and human rights, they nevertheless recognize that these values are not shared by the calculators hand men of Putin.
It is the same for what is considered the Russia as an ally in the fight against terrorism.
Is - it really conceivable that the homeland of the "red terror", countless unpunished crimes of the Soviet era and still dirty hands from the blood of Lithuanians to Caucasians may actually help fight the global threat brandished by the Iran and North Korea?
It seems more likely that the cold minds of the Kremlin will confine themselves to exploit each crisis to increase their destructive power and their influence.
For decades, the region of Europe where I come from was left at the mercy of evil.
This is why I can't remain silent when Europe stumbles blindly into a new appeasement.
We, the new democracies of Eastern Europe, have learned from our history that every diplomatic Act of the Russia behind is an imperialist ambition.
The Western Europeans, who have forgotten this history, should take into account our warnings.
The dependence on the Russia - even if it takes the face of self - saying "charismatic" Gerhard SchrÃ¶der - can only lead us straight into the wall.
Iraq: bullets against ballots.
When the war in Iraq began in 2003, the Bush administration had very ambitious plans: to the image of the Germany and Japan post - 1945, a long and peaceful occupation was envisaged, during which expanding oil production would assure rising prosperity as democratic structures were built piece by piece.
The basis should be a liberal constitution, and even post - modern, with bonus coverage of 25% of parliamentary seats to women.
The current Iraq knows neither peace nor prosperity.
The constitution which must be voted on October 15 includes the 25% rule, but there is nothing liberal.
The - key provision (section 2) stipulating that no law may contradict "the uncontested laws of Islam" violates the basic principles of parliamentary sovereignty and prevent legislation correspond to international standards.
For example, the age of consent to sexual intercourse for girls can be raised to above nine years, because Muhammad him - even had a wife of nine years.
It follows that nine girls are also adults next to the fair of the death penalty and criminal law for example, conversion to another religion.
The Shias can use this clause to place their ayatollahs above of the elected Parliament, as in Iran, because they alone are authorized to determine the "laws" of Islam.
Foreigners and a few Iraqi Liberals worry mainly from this Islamic clause, but opposition to the constitution, widespread among Sunnis, refers to other provisions: the exclusion of the "saddamist Ba'ath party" politics and the Government, and the federalist provisions that grant autonomy to the 18 Iraqi provinces and allow them to join in regional governments.
The exclusion Act is a personal problem for the Sunni elites, which include thousands of businessmen, Liberals, even artists, who, with a few exceptions, were all members of the Baath party.
In theory, the constitutional prohibition could not be retroactive.
But in practice, the administrative laws are today implemented to exclude members of the Baath party-saying "senior" of any form of government employment, respect to thousands of people.
The Sunnis would probably accept the federalist provisions if they applied only to the Kurds.
They know that the alternative is not a return to centralism, but the secession of the three provinces in Kurdish majority of Dahuk, Erbil and As Sulaymaniyah to form an independent Kurdistan, with its own Ministry of finance, its army (the Pesh Merga), and its oil production around Kirkuk, second largest reserve of Iraq.
Sunnis reject this same federalism for the Shiites because they consider them fellow Arabs who have always accepted Sunni Act in the past and which will again, unless they have their own Government.
This is what would allow the new constitution because the southern provinces - who possess the main Iraqi oil reserves - to Shiite majority could form their own regional government.
In the usual style of the Middle - East, Sunni leaders disappointed and dissatisfied with the constitution now threaten to use violence.
But federalism is not the only reason for which the supporters of the Sunni supremacy and Islamists launch deadly attacks.
Their opposition is more basic: they do not accept the principle of democratic Government by the majority.
Instead, they seek to restore the reign of the Sunni minority.
For the Islamists, all Shias deserve death anyway, as apostates.
A Shiite leader, Moqtada Sadr, has also vehemently oppose federalism.
His supporters, largely illiterate, are the poorest and most violent Shia slums of Baghdad and to the - beyond, whose "mahdi militia" fought American troops in 2004, even then the Americans were protecting Shiites from Sunni attacks.
As a young priest deriving his authority from his father, a populist deceased ayatollah him - even, Sadr must face the opposition of the living Iraqi ayatollahs who despise his ignorance and violence.
Sadr cannot possibly compete with them in terms of religious authority, so it chooses to take Arab - nationalist party against them, often Recalling that the highest Shiite cleric, Ayatollah Sistani, is not Arab but Persian.
In the same way, he reminded supporters that the El hakims, who lead the supreme Council of the Islamic revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) and their "Badr" militia were subsidized in Iran, exiles whose many fought the Iranian during the long and bitter war Iran - Iraq side, until Americans "brought back".
Sadr opposes federalism because a Shia regional government would obey his enemies, Sistani and SCIRI, and, he says, would fall under the Iranian umbrella.
To underline his message, Sadr sent his men fight the Badr militia, with success in Baghdad, where the mahdis are numerous, but not in Najaf, where Sadr is hated after the destruction he caused last year until his men are massacred by the Americans.
It was difficult enough to confront Sadr the bandit. Now, a simple political calculation suggests that it will probably be the main character to decide the outcome of the vote on the constitution in October.
To reject the constitution and provoke new elections to a Constitutional Assembly, opponents need a majority of two-thirds in at least three provinces.
The Sunnis are likely to prevail in two provinces, but if Sadr ordered his supporters from the slums of Baghdad to vote not with local Sunnis, this will probably put the capital in the hands of the opponents of the constitution and ensure its defeat.
Like any political thug, Sadr is naturally for sale.
Last year he was wanted for murder.
Today he seeks recognition as a statesman, he wants money, and, at least implicitly, the humiliation of Sistani and the SCIRI.
It may very well receive proposals, and negotiations have can - be already started.
But some Shiites that he attacks with words and bullets have thousands of gunmen at their disposal and for them, he deserves to receive bullets in return.
The end of secrecy.
Transparency is not always an easy exercise in the new democracies of Eastern Europe. This is what found Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany, when a record in which he confessed the lies of his Government has triggered riots.
As Hungary, the post - Communist Romania endeavoured to encourage the openness and honesty in a society that was once among the most closed in the world.
But the persistence of a culture of secrecy has exploded the corruption and abuse of power.
There is however a genuine evolution towards greater transparency, evolution recognized by the European Union which gave the green light to Romania for a membership at the beginning of the year 2007.
Also the implementation of what the EU is today for a "functioning market economy", essential reforms in the political and legal field which I am responsible, are strengthening the transparency and control of the financing of political parties to the reorganization of the judicial system.
Judicial reforms contribute to uprooting corruption.
Ministers and former Ministers, parliamentarians, judges, lawyers, and members of the forces of police, customs and other State bodies, as well as of private business leaders, have been indicted.
On the other hand, new forms have been developed for declarations of assets and financial interests by persons occupying official positions in the Government, Parliament, public and local administration and the judicial system.
The new modalities of declaration are the most detailed in Europe, and above all they are made public.
The progress of the Romania are confirmed by a report released this month - ci, whereby the citizens of Eastern Europe now have access to information Government just as much as those of the established democracies.
Report Transparency and Silence, by the Open Society Justice Initiative (available at www.justiceinitiative.org), indicates that the new democracies are sometimes better than the old ones: some Romanian governmental bodies were more responsive to requests for information to the citizens than their french or Spanish counterparts.
More specifically, 60% of applications are met in Romania, compared with 31% in France and 24% in Spain.
Other good students, include the Peru and Mexico, two countries that have adopted legislation on freedom of information in 2002, shortly after the Romania.
However, it is not always easier to access sensitive information in developing democracies.
I have worked as a lawyer for the defence of the Romanian Helsinki Committee human rights, and we often had recourse to the courts to require the communication of information under the Romanian law of 2001 on freedom of information.
For example, when we officially got access to data on wiretaps authorized by the Attorney general, he simply ignored the decision.
We attacked civil, and the judge has set a fine for each day of delay in the communication of information.
It is only when the media became interested in the case, that the data - number of plays during the previous ten years, authorized persons and duration of operations - have been made public.
Then, the Romania finally began to turn its back on a past marked by the omnipresence of the Securitate.
I am now part of the Government, and I realize that it is not always obvious to share certain information with the public.
But it happens that painful reforms are needed.
We have not carried out economic and political reforms that will enable us to enter the EU without submit our policies to the public and accept increased participation of citizens in the decision-making process which inevitably accompanies such openness.
Indeed, access to information has become a sine qua non of democracy everywhere in the world.
When States - United have adopted Freedom of Information Act in 1966, they were the only ones with the Sweden and the Finland.
Today, 65 countries have such legislation.
In Romania, those who fought for the adoption of a law on freedom of information to take full advantage.
According to the study of the Justice Initiative, aimed at the Romanian Government receive without great difficulty of the information that it would have been unthinkable to communicate a few years ago.
Thus, the Romanian Ministry of defence disclosed the number of soldiers who died in 2003, and the circumstances (including 13 suicides, two deaths by ball, and two deaths in combat in Afghanistan).
Another example, the Bucharest tribunal received a request for the number of judges subject to disciplinary proceedings since the beginning of the year 2000, and the reasons for sanctions.
The tribunal sent this query to the Higher Council of the Magistracy, which has given a complete answer: four pages listing all sanctioned judges, the reasons and the measures taken.
This process is both the fruit and the engine of the continuation of reforms.
The rulers have not always been very uncomfortable with the opening, and the battle continues for the most sensitive documents.
But in formerly Communist countries, the benefits of transparency are undeniable.
However, the experience of the Romania shows official secrecy is still a threat, that no country is immune, and that only a vigilance of every moment can prevent it from undermining the foundations of democracy.
Saving the trees of life.
No one can finish his day without using a product derived from the forest.
To a greater extent that we think generally, the paper on which are written, the water which flows from our faucets, drugs treating us, the wood that our homes and our furniture are made all come from the forest.
Forest we give fresh air we breathe and are home to endangered species.
They also offer places of leisure, which becomes increasingly important in the complexity of our world.
About 1.5 billion people living in the rural poor depend directly on forests for their basic needs of food and firewood.
However, deforestation continues.
Every year, we lose 14.6 million hectares of forest, an area almost as large as four times Switzerland.
The irresponsible management of the forests, accentuated by regulations and Government bonds too low and markets that reward illegal logging conspire to deprive the world of its most valuable and threatened forests.
When the forests begin to disappear, a whole range of environmental issues, social and economic follow generally, which affect us all in one way or another.
A good example is the island of Sumatra in Indonesia.
Pulp and paper companies are endemic and destruction of forests that are home to the greatest diversity of plants in the world.
It is likely that unknown plants will disappear in the process just as species endangered such as the rhinoceros and elephant Sumatra, as well as the orang - utang.
When the Sumatra forest will be gone, entire communities will be also without suitable living space or no decent way of earning a living.
In addition, distortion products cheap and illegal trade imposed on global markets is cause of difficulties for responsible citizens.
Developing countries lose 15 billion of tax revenue each year because of illegal logging.
To complicate everything, the demand for wood for reconstruction following the tsunami last year, has intensified an already unsustainable application vis - Ã  - vis of the forests of Sumatra.
The Amazon and Congo basins are subjected to similar threats.
A recent study by the United Nations, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA), shows that forests and other important regions are experiencing a serious decline of the fact of their mismanagement and continue to disappear if serious protection measures are not put in place.
The information published by the Brazilian Government show that deforestation of irreplaceable forests in the Amazon, due to agricultural conversion, reached 2.6 million hectares last year, bringing the total of the deforestation of the Amazon area to 17%.
However, the battle against deforestation is not yet lost.
Different organizations, movements and companies concerned the State of forests worldwide work together to reverse the phenomenon of deforestation and improve forest management.
Thus, for example, the WWF (World Wildlife Fund) and the World Bank have helped the Brazilian Government to launch an initiative to establish new areas of forest protection on more than 17 million hectares in the form of national parks.
The cooperation of WWF and the World Bank also motivated other partners to establish a trust fund to manage these areas protected in perpetuity.
Similarly, at the Summit of the leaders of the countries of the Congo basin allowed cross-border cooperation for the conservation of forests and their enlightened management.
This led subsequently to the release of 53 million USD on the part of the State Department - United to promote the conservation of the forests of the Congo.
Since the first meeting of the leaders in 1999, 3.5 million hectares of protected areas have been newly organized in the Congo basin.
Nevertheless, given the consequences of the Asian tsunami of last December, the weight of the arguments provided by EM and statistics on deforestation in the most critical areas, we must continue our efforts.
The World Bank and WWF have recently promised to work towards the reduction of 10% of the global rate of deforestation for 2010 and to work with the institutions of the public and private sectors to enable ambitious forest conservation achievements.
WWF studies show that if the world's forests are shared between different uses, including the protection of some areas, responsible for business management and restoration of forest landscapes, we can meet global needs in forest products while maintaining environmental and social values essential to our near future.
Leaders of businesses, Governments, organizations of civil society must all play their role in the realization of this vision.
The Saudis are â they fanatics?
The terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia have led many to question the prospects for survival of the ruling House of Saud and wondering about the question of whether the Kingdom is fundamentally dysfunctional and destructive.
For some reason or another, it seems that Saudi society has generated a stream of violent fanaticism that draws its inspiration from an extreme religious orthodoxy.
The fact that 15 of the 19 hijackers who took part in the attacks of September 11, 2001 against the States - United were Saudis crystallized a deep-rooted perception of the Kingdom as a bastion of authoritarianism and intolerance.
In some respects, this perception is right, but it cannot be applied to the Saudi population as a whole.
On the contrary, it would be a serious mistake to assume that fanatical Islamism fully defines Saudi attitudes towards religion.
Between 2001 and 2003, I was part of a team conducting a large-scale study of the values in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran and Jordan.
Our results have produced a surprisingly nuanced picture of Saudi attitudes.
By comparison with persons interviewed living in other countries of the Middle East, the Saudis have proved the least religious of all in general, and their attitudes toward democracy and arranged marriages also indicate a moderate - underlying feeling.
It is certain that in the four countries, religiosity is widespread, more than 90% of respondents indicating collectively that they believe in God, in a life after death, and heaven and hell.
But the Saudis appear to be less religious than their fellow Muslims.
Sixty - two percent of Saudis described themselves as religious individuals, against 82% of Iranians, 85% of Jordanians and 98% of the Egyptians.
Americans also seem to be more religious than Saudis, with 81%.
This variation can in part be explained by cross-national differences about the meaning of the term "religiosity".
For example, Americans may define religiosity differently of the inhabitants of the countries of the Middle East, with can - be a weaker attachment to religious beliefs in the Islamic countries.
This might also account in part for the differences between Muslim countries.
But the gap between the Saudis to one side and the Iranians, Jordanians and Egyptians on the other in self-defined religiosity, is so great that it defies the widespread perception of a Saudi Arabia extremely conservative and religious.
Indeed, the actions are more telling than words: only 28% of Saudis said that they attended weekly religious services, compared to 27% of Iranians, 44% of Jordanians, 42% of the Egyptians and 45% of Americans.
These conclusions, although contrary to popular perceptions of Saudi culture, are less surprising than they seem.
Sociologists of religion argue for a long time that in a monolithic religious environment, or when religious institutions are closely linked to the State, the overall religiosity of the population declines.
It makes sense to think that when the State authorities apply rigid behavioral codes, individuals tend to rebel and away from officially endorsed religious institutions.
It is thus hardly surprising that the Egyptians and Jordanians, who live in countries in which the State does not enforce piety, are more religious than Iranians or Saudis, who must deal with local 'virtue' supported by the State police.
Even on the issue of marriage, many Saudis expressed surprisingly liberal views.
Respondents were split almost evenly on the issue of arranged marriages, half supporting the idea that marriage should be based on parental consent, compared to 48% who considered love as the basis of marriage.
Given the gender segregation and paternal dominance firmly rooted, this result appears to reveal a strong desire for greater individual choice in what has always been, traditionally, a family decision.
Finally, the Saudis are proving fierce supporters of democracy, once again contradicting the widespread image of Saudi conservatism.
On all Saudis interviewed, 58% considered democracy as the best form of Government, that is, 23% disagreed, and 18% are not expressed.
The massive support for democracy in a country without secular and nationalist history seems counter - intuitive.
In fact, the support for democracy corresponds to several other liberal attitudes that we have seen in Saudi Arabia.
Proponents of democracy tend to be less religious, more secular, more tolerant toward others, most critical of the actions of the public sector, more worried by the Western cultural invasion.
To the - beyond the study data, history has shown that liberal ideas become more widespread when a despotic monarch governs with the support of a religious institution.
A strong current of liberalism appeared at the end of the ninth century in the Ottoman Syria in response to the religious despotism of sultan Abdul Hamid.
At the same time, a movement secular anti - clerical name of constitutionalism appeared in Iran, in response to the absolutist alliance between the Quajar shahs and the religious institution.
In the light of the similarities between these historical precedents and current conditions in Saudi Arabia, we should not rule out the possibility of reform.
The data of the study also suggest that the Saudis could very well require a more transparent policy and a less interventionist religion.
The European Museum.
At the end of the 19th century, Asia accounted for Europeans a source of artistic inspiration or target of imperialist ambitions.
Conversely, Europe was a symbol of modernity - for the Japanese of the era Meiji - decadence or - for the Chinese.
A century later, thanks to the Japanese economic miracle, Europeans considered at least a small part of Asia as a center of technological and industrial progress fast.
Today, at the dawn of the 21st century, the mutual perceptions of Europe and Asia are changing radically, with booming Asian economies and a European Union identity crisis.
Some Asian figures, like the former Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew, launch warnings to Europeans: if they continue on this path, their continent will soon be more interest than for tourism and the high range estate.
An influential Chinese businessman, who divides his time between Hong Kong and London, was even more specific.
He said a few weeks ago, during a demonstration private gathering in Paris of political leaders and of great business leaders: "you are becoming the third - world countries. You are wasting your time with the Constitution, the welfare State, the funding of pensions crisis, and you make systematically wrong answers to the questions you may have."
The idea that Europeans are from Asia in general and China in particular, is more complex. It ranges from lucid adaptation to a new respectable competitor to the ideological rejection pure and simple.
In May 1968, some french students took to the streets to invent a new world dreamed of Mao's China, a country still immersed in a brutal and senseless Cultural Revolution.
This absurd craze was the result both of the ignorance of the crimes of the Maoist regime, of boredom felt in a society thrives near full employment.
Today, their heirs openly criticize the Asian capitalist model.
China, once star anti - capitalist revolutionary utopians, became the enemy ultra - liberal feared by a new generation of reactionary utopians, who defend the status quo in Europe.
Students who have recently demonstrated in the streets of Paris do not want to imitate the Chinese and the Indians; they refuse the logic of globalization and the abandonment of hard-won social gains.
The attitude of the European economic elites is very different.
They have understood that their post - tinted nostalgia colonial designs, according to which China and the India would be of vast export markets and huge reservoirs of cheap labor, are obsolete.
These countries have become genuine competitors worthy of respect, even admiration.
Quality, cost and delivery - in the automotive industry for example - are reaching the European level.
Europe retains an advantage in scientific disciplines, as for the pharmaceutical industry, but new high-performance businesses, especially in India, manage more to recruit graduates of MIT and Harvard, and - through lower wage costs - to remain competitive on a global scale.
Unfortunately, if the European leaders have become aware of the Asian challenge, they have failed to translate it into a lesson in realism, in a context of irresistible globalization, or a call to arms in the social and economic field.
Indeed, European politicians, with a few rare exceptions such as Tony Blair, were too slow to adapt to blazing developments in Asia.
Devoid of long-term strategy, and obsessed with short-term interests, European politicians â unlike business leaders - have not earned the respect of their Asian counterparts.
Remains that, on a continent that has failed to bury the past and put an end to the spectre of nationalism, the EU is also a model of reconciliation, of peace and prosperity.
But this image can - she survive in a continuation of the decline?
For Asians, the European model could become a political version of Venice: a place that you can visit with nostalgia for a glorious past as a wonderful Museum.
Red and blue.
The appointment of Condoleezza Rice, the American Secretary of State post in replacement of Colin Powell shows that the recent presidential elections still have a powerful impact.
It is important that the Americans but also especially the rest of the world understand what these elections will reveal US America.
The presidential election this year proves that American democracy is healthy, and that some things could be improved.
Unlike the 2000 election, where president Bush had not received the support of the popular vote and barely won the vote of the electoral College, Mr. Bush won 3.5 million votes this time - ci.
While some Democrats remain bitter, the legitimacy of the victory of Mr. Bush cannot be questioned.
America is strongly divided between Republican red States and blue, democratic States.
If 100,000 votes were switched in the Red State of Ohio, John Kerry became president (although a minority popular vote).
The electoral College was incorporated into the US Constitution to protect small States in the federal system, and that means now that the election campaign now focuses largely on a dozen States at most, battlefields where public opinion is closely divided.
Basically, there is something implausible in the election of presidents without a popular majority.
So, it's time to discuss the amendment to the constitution to abolish the electoral College.
Some observers complain of rhetoric and the ads good to sow discord that have characterized this campaign.
This must be seen in historical perspective.
At the time of the founding fathers, newspapers take easily advantage and George Wahsington proved to be dismayed by the hardness of the political language.
For the most part of its award-winning history, not to mention the civil war and the reconstruction period, the country was as closely divided as it is today and the bitter rhetoric of the campaigns has always reflected this close competition.
However, despite negative advertisements by both sides, the three televised national debates raised important questions in a serious format and have been widely followed.
In general, any Chairman benefiting from economic growth has all chances to be re-elected.
In this sense, the real surprise of the re-election of Mr Bush was the low margin of its majority.
In large part, this is due to the unpopularity of the war in Iraq.
Mr. Kerry has tried to transform the war, the low rate of job creation, insufficient medical coverage and tax credits of Mr Bush towards the privileged classes of the central issues in the campaign, but some observers felt that it could not send a clear message.
Mr. Bush has countered it with the issue of security against terrorism and a cultural populism on issues such as gay marriage and abortion.
Finally, the cultural populism and security have prevailed against economic populism.
The interpretation of the election was influenced by surveys of exit polls in which voters were to decide (after having voted) on issues that have the most counted for them.
The majority (22%) answered 'moral values', by comparison only 20% cited the economy and 19% terrorism.
Social conservatives have interpreted this as meaning that they had won the election of Mr. Bush and that their program was to dominate his second term.
However, a Pew poll conducted one week after the election indicated that the category of "moral values" embraced a wide variety of issues in addition to the rights to abortion and gay marriage.
In fact, polls show that 25% of the public supports gay marriage and 35% are in favor of legal civil unions of gay couples (a position that defended Mr. Kerry).
Nevertheless, for the 37% who oppose gay marriage especially in the Red States in the centre of the country, the issue helped rally supporters of President Bush to come to the polls.
Remains whether, overall, if States - United are divided to the - beyond of all hope.
The electoral map of red and blue States gave birth on the Internet jokes and cartoons on the secession of the blue sides with the red center of the country.
Some call cela "CÃ´topie".
But the divisions are not so sharp.
In both camps, many States were won by a small margin and if one colorful maps by County rather than by State, most of the country turns purple.
Cities against suburbs and rural areas would be a better description of the situation instead of sides against heart of the country.
Indeed, public opinion polls show that most Americans are concentrated in the moderate Center of the political spectrum rather than the extremes.
But the political elites such as political activists and members of Congress tend to be more extremist than the public.
At first, this seems surprising, since they should feel attracted by the Center, rich voice.
However, many members of Congress represent districts that are acquired in their party and the real threat to their re-election comes to the primary parties, dominated by the more militant wing and the most extreme parties.
This tendency is reinforced by the rise of the cable TV, which attracts viewers through controversial programmes of info - entertainment, and Chronicles Internet writers called blogging, engaging in polemics fierce with no editorial filter.
A reform that would modify the boundaries of the districts of the Congress to make them more competitive enable to respond to this problem, but few chosen will vote such changes that could increase the risk of their defeat.
The narrow margin of the results suggests that Mr. Bush does not really have the mandate for change that he thinks winning.
Addressing issues difficult foreign policy, tax and social, it would be prudent to look inwards rather than reconcile his conservative base, but policy that will prevail between the politics of conviction or the pragmatic policy remains uncertain.
Get oil!
Chancellor Angela Merkel has made the fight against climate change the priority of the German Presidency of the European Union and G8 starting in January.
Its concrete proposal is broad enough so that leaders take into account and accept it, and clear enough for other Governments and businesses understand: at the next Summit of the G8, should simply set a date from which gasoline-powered vehicles will be more registered in the major industrialized countries.
This decision will have a substantial positive impact to the geopolitical and economic levels.
Today, the real concern energy is not related to the loss of the world's reserves of oil, but rather to the decline of the internal of the biggest consumers production - Europe, the - United States and China-, at the moment even where the increasing demand of Asia strike the market.
Available reserves will focus more to the Middle - East, as those of other regions of the world will soon be dry...
Moreover, major oil exporters are unwilling to submit their investment policies to the market conditions.
Saudi Arabia wants to manage only its production of oil and, for its part, the Iran scared potential investors with bureaucratic obstacles and its corruption.
The Iraq suffers from a lack of security, while foreigners are being failed at every attempt to investment in Russia.
These four States contain half of global oil reserves, of which two-thirds could potentially be exported.
These factors, apart from the costs of production, are at the root of the high prices of oil and the race for contracts in Africa and Central Asia.
Believing that the increase in the price of oil is a good thing for the environment ignores the elementary data of international politics.
First of all, in most poor countries in Africa and Asia, the significantly import oil represents a greater proportion of national expenditure that in industrialized countries, which means that economic growth and social development are compromised, and that new debt crises threaten.
Annuities of oil production impede reforms in the major exporting countries.
Through the strengthening of their financial power, regimes such as those of the Venezuela and the Iran feel less constrained by international rules.
The latest arrivals among the big countries of energy consumers, like China, reproduce ancient patterns of the industrialized West and their long tradition of condoning human rights violations, to secure lucrative contracts with authoritarian and oil-rich regimes.
Only heavy political and economic, the industrialized countries that remain by far the main consumers of hydrocarbons can initiate a change around the world.
It is important to start with the transport sector, that proportion at present time more than half of oil consumption - which will certainly increase in the future.
Therefore, the G8 countries should agree to no longer register of new cars at gasoline from 2025.
This decision is not directed against individual mobility, but against the waste of a scarce resource to be used as a priority to produce synthetic materials.
Politicians should not favor any particular technology.
They should rather encourage the car industry to develop alternative technologies that use biofuels, ethylene, hydrogen and even natural gas, for a transitional period.
Countries that have paved the way for the political will in this matter, as a collateral benefit, put national industries in first place in the energy technology to ensure subsequent contracts.
The significant reduction in expected CO2 emissions could ultimately lead to the necessary progress of international policy on climate.
Economic development also comes into play: If we take care of our "addiction" to oil, poor and least developed countries, as well as the newly industrialized countries, could be more, which would lower prices and would ease the energy competition.
At the geopolitical level, profits would also manifest, including the large oil exporting countries would be much less able to blackmail industrialized countries.
This change would increase the bargaining strength of the international community in the Near - East and consolidate the social forces of countries such as Saudi Arabia, the Iran and Russia, who seriously wish to promote economic and political of the Interior reforms.
Major automobile producer and countries with advanced technology, the Germany is well placed to launch such an initiative.
Angela Merkel, who holds a doctorate in physics and began his political career to the position of Minister of the environment - presiding in 1995 the first conference of the Convention - United Nations climate change framework, would be more credible than any other of his colleagues of the Union European and G8 to tackle the problem.
It is high time to perform an act of political bravery.
The myth of humanitarian aid and trade.
Humanitarian aid and trade have become words to international fashion.
(Accompanied by a relief of debt) increased humanitarian aid and greater access to markets in rich countries for the products of poor countries: it now seems to have taken first place in the international agenda.
In fact, the debate today is more on measures to be taken, but on the amount of measures to be taken and how quickly.
Lost in all this: the clear lessons of five decades of economic development.
At the forefront of these lessons, we view that economic development is left largely in the hands of poor nations they - same.
Countries which themselves are well managed in the recent past have succeeded through their own efforts.
Humanitarian aid and markets have played only a minor role.
Take the example of a developing country which has free and preferential access to the market of its largest neighbour, which is also be the most powerful economy in the world.
Suppose in addition that this country is able to send millions of its citizens work on the other side of the border, receives a huge volume of foreign investment and is fully integrated into international production chains.
In addition, the country's banking system is supported by its rich neighbor and its willingness to act as a lender of last resort.
Globalization could not be present under better auspices than - there is not?
Now consider a second country.
That - must cope with a trade embargo on the biggest world market, does not receive nor helps foreign nor any form of support from the Western world, is excluded from international organizations such as the WTO and cannot borrow money from the IMF and the World Bank.
If these external disadvantages were not sufficiently debilitating, can add an economy which maintenance it - even the barriers against international trade (in the form of State trading, import tariffs and quantitative restrictions).
As was able to guess the player, these countries actually exist: it's the Mexico and the Viet Nam.
The Mexico shares a border of 3,200 kilometres with the States - United, which provides not only privileged access to a market of goods and labor, but also to a share of the resources of Treasury (as the experience of the peso crisis in 1995 made the demonstration).
On the other hand, America has maintained its trade embargo against the Viet Nam until 1994, has not restored its diplomatic relations before 1995 and awarded the status of most favoured nation in Vietnamese imports that many years later.
The Viet Nam still not entered the WTO.
Now let's examine their economic performance.
Since the signing of NAFTA in December 1992, the Mexican economy has experienced an average annual increase of barely more than 1% per head.
Not only this figure is well below the rate of the champions of the Asian economy, but it is also only a fraction of the performance of growth to the Mexico of the decades prior to the debt crisis of 1982 (3.6% per year between 1960 and 1981).
Viet Nam, however, experienced an annual increase of 5.6% per head since the early days of its economic reforms in 1988 and the restoration of diplomatic relations with the States - United in 1995, and has experienced continuous rapid growth at the rate of 4.5% since.
The Viet Nam has witnessed a dramatic poverty fall while the Mexico has experienced a fall in real wages.
These two countries have experienced a pronounced takeoff of international trade and foreign investment, but the overall picture is very contrasted here where it counts most: in the improvement of standards of living, particularly among the poor.
What these examples demonstrate, is that domestic efforts dwarf all other elements in the determination of the economic fortunes of a country.
All that the US market had to offer at the Mexico could not offset the consequences of policy mistakes on the internal market, particularly the inability to reverse the real appreciation of the exchange rate of the peso or to extend the productivity gains achieved in a narrow range of export activities to the rest of the economy.
What matters most is the adoption by a country of an appropriate growth strategy.
Without any of the advantages that benefited the Mexico, the Viet Nam has continued a strategy countered on the diversification of its economy and the improvement of the production capacity of local suppliers.
The overall experience of the after - war supports the evidence that domestic policies are the most important.
South Korea took off in the early 1960s, not when foreign subsidies were at their peak, but when they began to dry up.
Taiwan has not benefited from foreign subsidies or preferential access to certain markets.
China and the India, economic superstars of the time, flourished largely through their own economic reform efforts.
It is tempting to on behalf of foreign demand for their products to export rare African successes, the Botswana and Mauritius (respectively diamonds and clothing), but this cannot go very far.
Obviously, these two countries would be much poorer without access to foreign markets.
But, as in all cases of development passed, what set apart them is not the external advantages they enjoyed but their ability to exploit these advantages.
Just to see how other countries have messed up the advantage that provide their natural resources.
The word "diamond" does not specifically give rise in mind an image of peace and prosperity in Sierra Leone.
Similarly, few of proliferating around the world export processing zones have experienced development level observed in Mauritius.
It does not, however, relieve the rich countries of their obligation to help.
They can make life difficult to corrupt dictators, by better sharing financial information and refusing to recognize international contracts that they sign.
Similarly, the increase in the number of workers in poor countries authorised to work in rich countries and a broader range of policies oriented towards growth thanks to the relaxation of rules and conditions of the WTO imposed by States - United would produce a more significant impact on long-term development.
There is no evidence that the enlargement of the market access and subsidies represents the best use to make political capital of the northern hemisphere.
Development should focus on the improvement of the political environment in poor countries, rather than on aid and trade.
Interdependencies.
If the great Argentine Economist Raul Prebisch were alive today, it is no question that he would if the world began to turn upside down.
His widely influential dependency theory argued that if poor countries were resting too much on exports of raw materials, they would never reach the industrial level needed to sustain rapid growth.
They embourberaient to place in a cycle of global decline in prices of raw materials and reduction without end of the revenue share.
Prebisch favorite response, protectionism, proved disastrous for the many Latin American and African countries that followed it.
But the fact is that for years, Prebisch seems to have had the reaction just about trends in the prices of materials first in the long term.
Any permanent efficiencies in agriculture and natural resource extraction sectors were lower prices of raw materials, especially in the 1980s and 1990s.
With few exceptions, countries that have concentrated on exports of raw materials got that poor results, while Asian countries with few resources have made rapid progress.
Today, however, with the Asian giants, the India and China, which joined the world economy, the prices of gasoline, gold, wheat and virtually all other raw materials explode.
Of course, there are always cycles (the price of oil, for example, probably again fall before resuming its ascent) but the trend in the long term of many commodities remain clearly on the rise for some time.
What many trade negotiators and other decision makers did not seem to recognize, even though Prebisch would have understood it immediately, it is that this sudden turnaround has huge implications for the global balance of power.
Indeed, any other aspect of economic globalization does not provide greater challenges to the leaders of the world in the coming decades.
The questions are many.
The rich countries of today are - they prepared to enter a period of co - dependency, in which they all also desperately seeking raw materials that developing countries are industrialized products and technologies?
Are - they prepared for the inevitable flow of power and influence to the producers of raw materials as those - ci will enrich themselves?
How the two super - powers of the world, China and the States - United, go - they manage the fact that major exporting regions of raw materials of Africa and the Middle - East to Central Asia are covered with poorly trained nation - States?
Some self-proclaimed prophets expose the problem as the limits of natural reserves and claim that the most critical raw materials decline at an alarming rate.
Nowadays, many are followers of the "Hubbert peak" theory of oil production, which supports that we have reached the upper limits of our production capabilities, the wells are drying up and that the situation can only deteriorate.
However, as indicated by the eminent oil historian Dan Yergin, the birds of ill omen have claimed that black gold resources were about to dry up at least four times already.
At each time, radical technological advances made soar these threats.
At the end of the 1800s, oil extraction involved dredging with mullets.
Today, 3,000 m below the ocean-floor drilling seems natural to everyone.
Such progress have also been made in the areas of extraction of metals and agriculture.
No, the world is not facing a shortage next raw materials.
In reality, it happens that the integration of 2.5 billion people (China and the India) into the world economy produces a demand shift likely to put more pressure on the rising prices of raw materials that no technological gain will be probably able to counterbalance.
Therefore, and this at least for 50 to 75 years, and may be even until the humans begin to drill on Mars over the coming centuries, many natural resources prices will go.
The new balance of economic powers resulting it will destabilize the world political situation?
The first world war was partly triggered by the concern of the Germany before grabbing by the other colonial powers of too much of the world's oil and raw materials.
Similarly, during the second world war, the Japan has feared for the stability of its supplies in petroleum and other natural resources from abroad.
Such tensions are going - they appear between China uncertain resources (even the scarcity in water is problematic) and the West?
Fortunately, this seems unlikely at the moment, especially in the light of the approach also sober pragmatic problems of their country's resources expressed by Chinese leaders.
The Chinese are turning to regions such as Africa hoping to find stable trading partners.
They do not share the political evangelism of the Americans, who want not only to trade with raw materials exporters, but also want to convert them.
And then there are those American leaders who still speak to the States - us self-sufficient in terms of energy resources.
This is a joke: sufficient, perhaps, but auto - sufficient, never.
A large part of the Arab world think, and it is understandable that the Iraq invasion constitutes the cornerstone of the American strategy to secure stable energy resources.
If they are right, one can only hope that America has a backup solution.
Meanwhile, prices of raw materials will continue to rise, and oil exporters constitute the biggest contributors to the gaping trade deficit of the States - United.
May be the real strategy American it is to try to have to oil-exporting countries so much money that those - ci will become dependent on the happiness they provide to America!
This is a turning point that Prebisch would have never foreseen.
The radical choice of the Iran.
The choice of the Iranians to power the radical Mayor of Tehran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, may damage relations with the West and accentuate the isolation of the country at the international level.
However, in terms of national policy, the Islamist regime is will be probably better than if a more moderate candidate had prevailed.
It is clear that Ahmadinejad has a real base of support.
The fact that it is presented as a populist, he has talked about helping the poor, condemned the Government and acted virtually as an opposition candidate is not: it embodied the choice of regime, and eventually receive official assistance including against radical rivals.
The regime has demonstrated great skill.
He has turned a little more pragmatic candidate Hashemi Rafsanjani, disagree with government policies, as a character in harmony with the established order, and its own rebel candidate.
The Government thus used resentment against the establishment to consolidate his own power.
Given that the former president, Mohammad Khatami, argued the reform movement, even though it was a little reckless and he was in the end nothing done, done that highlight how leaders have returned to their political advantage.
Ahmadinejad is a representative of the young activists of the anti - Shah revolution of 25 years ago.
He is directly involved in U.S. in Iran hostage, although not really knowing how.
Most worrisome is that it is close to the two main groups that represent the most extreme elements in Iran: the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and the Basij organization.
The first is an army parallel pro - regime. the second is an organization that intimidates opponents and anyone who is looking for a more open society.
However, this concern to see the Iran at the hands of leaders more radical is mitigated by two factors.
First, Ahmadinejad is likely to focus on national problems, and try - without that we can predict his chances of success - to improve the living conditions of the poorest Iranians.
Secondly, the party in power since the revolution will continue to carry out ideological and foreign policies.
The president has fewer powers that it seems, and it is especially overshadowed by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Whatever the case, the election of Ahmadinejad clarifies sacrament the Iran challenge for Western policy and the stability of the Middle - East.
First of all, it sends the signal to the extremists of Iran and terrorist clients of the country--the Lebanese Hezbollah, Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and several smaller groups that act against Saudi Arabia, the Iraq and other Arab countries - that they have the green light to launch their attacks.
They will probably estimate that the Iran will support them, even though they do.
In appearance, the Iran has often proved relatively cautious, covered playing the role of global sponsor of terror.
Iranian officials who were able, individually, to act to control and coordinate specific operations, will now feel freer to do so.
In addition, Ahmadinejad openly advocates an intensive program to obtain nuclear weapons.
Most Iranian politicians in any case those authorized by the Government to act to the big day, supports this program, but promotes an approach more discreet and prudent.
Rafsanjani, for example, puts the establishment of better relations with the West before the advance on the nuclear front.
If Ahmadinejad is president of a nuclear Iran, he is more likely to use weapons in a haphazard way.
This does not mean that he would use them, but rather that it serve purposes of diplomatic blackmail, raising threats to crisis levels.
Since Iranian leaders daily proclaim their desire to wipe Israel of the map and to fight States - United (Ahmadinejad stepped on the image of an American flag by going to vote), the risk of confrontation has increased.
Finally, Ahmadinejad is likely to embolden at the point of endangering the stability of the Iraq, and his victory will encourage radical Iranian officials and Iraqi extremists.
The Iran already sends many agents in Iraq and supports customers looking to turn this country into clone.
The Iraqis, including Shiite Muslims, who follow the same version of Islam than the Iranians, generally reject such interference.
A more militant Iranian position may increase friction with the Iraq, and will inspire more anti - U.S. violence.
In short, the outcome of the Iranian elections is dangerous, even if its destabilizing potential will depend on the actions of Ahmadinejad and the degree of power that it will grant Khamenei.
In addition, dealing an also openly extremist Iran - radical even by the criteria of an already hard regime - will be a challenge not only for the States - United, but also for Europe.
European countries are going - they continue to pretend that the militant rhetoric and provocations of Ahmadinejad do not count and that it is possible to find diplomatic solutions to the Iran nuclear ambitions?
With Rafsanjani, a real deal or at least the appearance of cooperation would have been easy to maintain.
But with Ahmadinejad, it will take a huge dose of conciliation to maintain only the most minimal diplomatic procedure.
Some reformists and Iranian exiles welcomed the election of Ahmadinejad, because they believe that his administration is more likely to show the true face of the regime and disabuse any hope of compromise by Westerners.
But it can also symbolize the success of the regime to return to its advantage the discontent caused by a quarter of a century of Islamic reign radical.
Regardless of the consequences, the victory of Ahmadinejad mean for the West that everything related to the Iran will become even more delicate.
Take the poor, give to the rich.
President Bush seems on the verge of ruining the US budget for years to come.
When president Bush took office, the forecast anticipated budget surpluses as long as one could imagine.
Today, thanks to a mixture of irresponsible tax cuts initiated by Republicans, an economic downturn, the bursting of the bubble of the stock market and a massive increase in military spending, the horizon tax is dominated by large deficits.
The worst is yet to come, because the Bush administration and the Republican majority Congress prepare to aggravate the fiscal mess.
The havoc that they will probably weaken the States - United and will increase the instability of the international economy.
Usually, the Republican defended balanced budgets.
This changed with the Reagan administration, when conservative Republicans showed themselves favourable to tax reductions, when well even that came with large budget deficits.
President Reagan announced to the American people that he could enjoy all of tax reductions, the building of the army and the continuation of their favorite spending programs.
The result, not surprisingly, was a series of large fiscal deficits and that the removal took several years.
President George Bush Sr. as much as president Bill Clinton had to raise taxes to bring order to the chaos of the era Reagan.
These tax increases probably contributed to the defeat of president Bush senior by Bill Clinton in 1992.
Yet Clinton bravely decided to complete the process to restore fiscal balance, in part to protect funding for long-term social security retirement programs.
When Clinton left the Presidency in 2000, the budget situation was best for decades.
Then came president George Bush son, ready to replay Reagan with significant tax reductions, a considerable increase in military expenditure and the continuation and even the development of popular spending programs.
The result was predictable.
In January 2001, the cumulative budget for the years 2002 to 2011 anticipated a budget surplus of $ 5.6 trillion.
Mid - 2002, these anticipated surpluses had fainted.
In the light of these new economic conditions, and in the shade of the war against Iraq, one would expect that the Bush administration and the Republican Congress are cautious in defending further tax reductions.
But far from it, their main priority is to implement further tax cuts benefiting in large part by only the well-to-do.
At the same time, the Government is claiming significant increases in military spending.
With the approach of the presidential election of November 2004, we can be certain that no significant reduction in spending will occur in non-military programs.
It seems that massive budget deficits are intended to survive.
If domestic spending remain just constant, a fraction of national income level, the cumulative budget forecast for next ten years anticipate an overall deficit of $ 1.5 trillion.
But this figure could be very optimistic, because it likely does not take into account the cost of a likely war against Iraq, or another set of tax cuts, or the risk of increasing the rate of interest for years to come.
Why the Republicans show - they so little affected by this disorder?
Some Republicans are concerned about more tax cuts for the wealthy than anything else.
Others think that deficits will force significant reductions in domestic government spending, lead to thus reducing the participation of the State, which is their greatest wish.
The problem of this final analysis is that most taxpayers are attached to social programs and will not easily support large spending cuts.
The most intriguing question remains why Americans vote for such policies when they should know that it would probably problems result.
One of possible answers is that many voters do not see come the budgetary problems.
A better answer lies in the fact that most Americans have in fact not vote for these policies.
The 2002 election turnout was only 40% of voters, and only the approximately half of these 40% voted for the Republicans, about 20 per cent of the persons entitled to vote.
Of course, the Outlook need not necessarily be so dark.
The Iraq war will be can - be avoided.
The foreseen tax reductions may be moderate or abandoned.
But I predict large budget deficits for years to come and a growing sense of unease within the States - United and internationally about the macroeconomic situation in America.
Foreign investors could decide to reduce their funding of the Government's budget and current-account deficit America in favorable terms.
The dollar might falter, and the fear of inflation could become even more pronounced.
All this will cause to lose confidence in political decision-makers of the States - United that will be less flexible in their responses to economic shocks.
The classes in the States - disadvantaged U.S. and abroad, could suffer the most, since president Bush and Congress say to the American people and the world that it has no funds available to address the issue of poverty, health and education, because of the large budget deficits.
If the average American does not open our eyes to these tax risks, the well-to-do would qualify for another gift from several billion dollars while the country and the world to support the harsh consequences for years to come.
Lessons of fiscal recklessness of America.
George W. Bush did much more to destroy the economic policy of the States - United than all other presidents in American history, exceeding even his mentor, Ronald Reagan.
In only three years of mandate, it has destroyed a fragile political consensus which had requested ten years of efforts and which may require another ten years to be rebuilt.
In doing so, Bush risked the economic health and social stability in the long term of America.
Given that long-term budgetary challenges that manage States - United in a very clumsy way is not the only existing challenges, tax blunders of America offer important lessons to other countries.
The main problem with tax policy is that politicians can easily get temporarily popular by lowering taxes and increasing public spending while accumulating massive public debts and leaving their refund future elected officials.
This ploy can last a few years, but budget deficits and growing public debt earlier than planned impose a painful change in policy.
A cynical politician can however buy re-election and may be party to retire when the crisis arrives.
One could imagine that after decades of similar episodes of political irresponsibility in countries around the world, voters would be allergic to this type of ploy.
However, Bush applied again in today buying popularity by distributing massive tax cuts while simultaneously increasing military spending and spending on education and health.
The resulting budget deficit is equivalent to more than 5% of GNP.
Worse yet, America's long-term budgetary prospects were already worrying before Bush begins to apply its reckless policies.
The American population is aging, so the costs of pension and health care systems financed by public funds will rise skyrocket.
Extensive calculations show that the revenues that will be generated through tax policies advocated by Bush are likely not reach tens of trillions of dollars that represent the costs of public pensions, health care, and other tax expenditures expected by the population.
At some point in the future, need greatly increased tax recoveries, drastically reducing public spending, or both, to compensate for the actions of Bush.
Then why the population supports - it policies?
Because it includes little these consequences in the long term, or that it cares little, even if these consequences will ultimately have an impact on the majority of Americans.
The richest taxpayers are naturally happy because they benefited from most of the tax cuts.
As surprising as it may seem, the richest 5% of American taxpayers have received about half of the tax cuts and these rich taxpayers clearly expect that the other 95% (the middle class and the poor) support the majority of future spending reductions and tax increases.
Between - time, Bush has convinced a large number of poor voters and voters of the middle classes that they should also be satisfied with their lot, without telling them that they have to pay their small tax cuts by reductions much more substantial of future government services if his administration policies prevail in the long term.
If the Americans had a political memory, they understand that they have already climbed this fiscal "roller coaster" over the past 20 years.
Also, Ronald Reagan took his duties with a promise of massive tax cuts and large increases in military spending.
It ended with a huge budget deficit in the mid 1980s.
The tax cuts have made it extremely popular Reagan and allowed him to be re-elected in 1984.
Then, it took a decade (from the second Reagan term until the mandates of George Bush, SR. and Bill Clinton) to return to a surplus budget.
Of course, this result necessitated the approval of new tax increases, which claimed re-election of George Bush, SR. and has led to the polarized politics of the 1990s.
The story has great chance to repeat.
Some ideologues of right in the Bush Administration believe that current budget deficits will result ultimately in a drastic reduction in social spending by the Government.
They hope to dismantle programs such as social security and Medicare.
But the American public strongly supports these social programs.
Thus the strategy that is first to reduce taxes to lead must be subsequently reductions in social programs is doomed to failure and will inevitably result in the increase in tax rates.
Other ideologues of the Bush Administration argue that tax cuts are crucial to exit the States - United of the recession.
This argument is also wrong.
America's economy could recover without the tax cuts, and perhaps still more firmly.
In all cases, it is a monumental mistake to base fiscal policies in the long term on the economic cycle in the short term.
Other countries have two essential to remember this situation lessons.
The first is that the imminent budget deficits of States - United will limit sooner or later the international power of America.
Americans have supported the Iraq war only because they did not have to subsidize it by higher taxes.
When the Americans will be forced to choose between foreign adventures and higher taxes, they will be much less inclined to support expensive military operations abroad.
In effect, States - United will be deeply divided internally when the population will be faced with the fiscal mess left by Bush.
The second lesson is that countries need to plan their budgets based on rising tax costs caused by an aging population.
Long-term budgetary conditions are rarely taken into account by the taxpayers or the Parliament.
Governments should be asked to submit long-term budget assessments at the same time their proposals for annual budget to reduce the trend towards a political manipulation on the short term of the budget.
States - United may play the role of an alarm signal to the other countries.
The White House should give other countries the same advice that the magicians on television give their viewers: "Do not try to do the same to you".
The politicization of the securities markets.
Many economic and financial analysts complain that the securities of emerging markets are often heavily manipulated by their Governments and are more political than economic.
By contrast, a primitive force of economic nature regulates securities markets in developed countries and predict their performance is in fact to predict the growth of the trees.
This description of securities in emerging markets is not false, just biased, because the same description applies to securities markets in developed countries.
Indeed, the best analysts know that predict the performance of any country securities market returns at the bottom to predict the degree to which the Government wishes to investors in securities markets are involved in the current political environment.
Take the market for the securities of the United States, by far the largest in the world.
The Government leaves the quiet business and return on investment in the U.S. securities market reflect the fundamental forces of a strong capitalist economy.
This partly explains why States - United attract worldwide portfolio investors.
But the returns that make the American securities markets so attractive reflect a delicate political balance.
In particular, tax rates that affect securities have varied over time with the change of political pressure.
During World War II, for example, political support for the wealthy has declined and the Government has increased taxes on capital gains, dividends and incomes in general.
When the second world war helped to significantly improve the economy weakened by the Great Depression of the 1930s, president Roosevelt and the Congress have implemented a tax on windfall profits in order to guarantee that the shareholders do not emit too consequently benefit.
By contrast, in 1980, when there was no war but the securities market was at a low level, American voters have elected Ronald Reagan, a man considered by many as too right to be president.
He requested, and obtained, reductions in taxes on capital gains, dividends, and income.
Political interference in the securities market are not only on taxes on capital gains, dividends, and income.
Property taxes, indirect taxes, import duties and taxes on sales, which are all paid, directly or indirectly, by companies, can impact amplified on the profits of the business and therefore on the securities market.
It is no coincidence that where markets are growing securities, Governments ensure that these taxes up lower corporate profits after tax.
Indeed, the policies of the securities markets do not stop to taxes.
On the contrary, almost every activity of Government affects companies and, subsequently, profits of the securities market.
After the crash of 1929 securities markets, the U.S. Government has suspended much anti-trust activity that allowed companies to acquire a monopoly that would increase their value.
This policy has delayed the decline in the unemployment rate, but was not enough to control the political forces deployed to support the market of securities.
Similarly, one of the most important actions undertaken by president Reagan was to destroy a large part of the power remaining unions of America, which competed for their share of the industrial cake.
The victory by Reagan during the 1981 air traffic controllers represented a watershed for the American trade union movement, and also for the securities market that launched its spectacular market upward in 1982.
The U.S. Government has proved particularly hard to support the market of securities from the highest point of the illusion of the stock prices in 2000, and in particular to reduce interest rates repeatedly.
Of course, this measure was publicly justified in terms of economic stimulus, and not in terms of support for the market of securities.
But it is very revealing of the extent of the U.S. market for securities that one of the most important factors influencing the economy as regards prices of shares down.
Indeed, the response of the authorities is not confined to a monetary stimulus.
National accounts products and income of the States - United show that the effective rate of tax on the profits of the business (the percentage of profits actually paid to the Government in the form of taxes) is mounted in crete to 33.7% in the first quarter of 2000 (the record of the market of securities and the economy in general) and dropped to 20.2% in the fourth quarter of 2003When the market was down.
Much of this decline reflects the tax relief measures passed by the Congress as well as the perception among businesses in the economic environment and political current, they may be more combative to avoid paying taxes.
In addition, after the crash of the market of securities, the maximum tax on dividends on securities increased from 35% to 15%, providing a new substantial benefit to investors in the long term and intensifying the combined effect of the reinvestment of dividends after tax.
Again, this tax reduction was warranted to stimulate the economy which may, of course, apply to virtually any measure designed to support the market of securities.
But it is the balance of political forces that determines the credibility of this type of justification.
It could be argued that the same variables, including hostility to high taxes and a weak labour movement, worked to States - United over the past 200 years and that they should continue to operate in the future, producing of high returns on securities markets and attracting considerable foreign capital influx.
Those who believe that investments in American securities market will follow the same trend of growth high for decades could very well be right.
But it is important to be clear on what is predicted.
Forecasts are first and foremost not only on the economy but on policy, or even on cultural values, which shape the policies and economic performance.
The real estate market on a global scale.
There's no more local than investment in real estate investment. The residence purchased is rooted in a specific place, like a tree, and flowers or wasting away at the discretion of local economic conditions.
Worldwide across our TV screens, but the real estate market, composed almost exclusively of local amateurs, rarely crosses the local geographical boundaries.
Soon, however, this could change.
Within a month, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), in collaboration with my company MacroMarkets, as well as with Fiserv and Standard & Poor's, will launch of options on futures contracts on real estate prices in ten cities in the States - United.
The contracts will be based on indices of real estate prices S & P / Case - Shiller, established on the basis of speculative research that my colleague Karl Case and myself have conducted, nearly twenty years ago.
For a long time, we dÃ©marchons for a real estate market futures, but no scholarship, up to now, wanted to use these indices to create such a market.
Futures on home prices will allow investors from around the world to invest indirectly in American real estate, through these markets.
A buyer in Paris, Rio de Janeiro or Tokyo will be able to invest in homes occupied by their owners in New York, Los Angeles and Las Vegas, among others.
One of the fundamental principles of financial theory - the diversification or the distribution of risk - implies that the interest for these new contracts will be strong.
Businesses and residents of New York, for example, are overexposed to the local real estate risks. However, by selling their homes to term, they would succeed in reducing these risks.
Investors in Tokyo will assume a share of the risk by buying at end of housing in New York, if the price is right.
The New - Yorkers will continue to live in their homes, while having divided the risks of investment everywhere in the world.
Experience a real futures on United - family homes has not retried since 1991, when the London Futures and Options Exchange (now known as Euronext.liffe) missed the launch of such a market.
This test has never generated large volumes of transactions.
The stock exchange launched a concept that has satisfied no one.
British markets of paris diversified on real estate prices, as well as some retail markets online, never reported either.
Sera - it different this time - ci?
Of course, the launch of a new market is still uncertain. People interested in an idea if it already captivated many others; If person is seduced, it will not attract more.
It goes the same for markets. If not interested investors, it not occur enough transactions to generate profits to attract others.
However, as is the case for all the brilliant ideas, we know never very well why they attract. Also, we cannot predict the start of this new market, but we know that sometimes, success is in the make - you.
Initial indicators suggest that the growing interest in the forward transactions in real estate prices, mainly because of the ambient discourse on the "real estate bubble", stresses the importance of diversification of risks.
After the announcement of the CME, one of its competitors, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, said its project to create options on futures in the largest U.S. regions, based on the average real estate prices published by the National Association of Realtors (National Association of Realtors).
However, in addition to the strong public interest in real estate investment and risk coverage, another thorny issue must be set so that the futures markets work well: prices must be openly disclosed and investors must understand the meaning.
I believe there are great chances that these futures markets soon lead to a fall in prices in some U.S. cities.
It will be "offset" issue, as say traders. Today, the futures market is lower than the price of a property.
Presumably, the offset will not appear on the first day of real estate transactions, but should occur within a few months.
We need offset if some of these markets effectively perform their functions.
Everyone knows that these cities have experienced a huge housing boom in recent years (it is a widespread global phenomenon).
International investors seem not very inclined to invest in these cities, without the prospect of a fall in prices based on futures markets. The inhabitants of Tokyo learned at their expense.
However, if the offset is large enough, even investors who believe that the U.S. housing market is in full decline can always expect a good return of futures real estate prices, because they already benefit from a lower price in the futures market.
Nevertheless, the New - Yorkers will need to make a few adjustments to cover their own real estate investments, if they want to sell contracts in the term naturally causing a fall in prices.
They should be made to the idea that the market has already anticipated this decline and that they can protect themselves from the tiny potential margin that exceeds this anticipation.
In fact, such adjustments in our way of thinking probably occur if observed carefully the future market prices.
Until now, the evolution of the price of real estate was essentially the result of diverse opinions.
When markets will create an international consensus about the housing prices in all major cities of the world, it will be easier to manage the risks they face in stabilizing their economies on the one hand, and on the other hand, our own standards of living.
But what makes move markets?
Since May 10 about, most markets have accused strong cumulative declines, especially in the two weeks around May 23, with average prices persisting downward.
Worries about global stock markets are - they synonymous with concerns for the world economy?
Consider the largest decreases.
Among major countries, the most impressive crash is India, where them courses fell by 16.9% between May 10 and May 22.
The debacle on the other side the globe took almost as much magnitude. There, the ups and downs have had only a few days offset with those of the India: in Argentina, the prices have plummeted 16.1% 14.7% Brazil and Mexico of 13.8%.
European markets have also suffered big losses.
In Sweden, prices have tumbled 15.2% between May 9 and May 22. virtually on the same period, they fell by 9.7% in Germany, 9.4% in France and the United Kingdom and 9.3% in Italy.
In Asia, prices decreased by 11.5% in Korea, 9.3% in Hong Kong and 8% to Japan about over the same period.
Many commentators try to link these events to the situation in the States - United.
Yet, the American courts have accused to that a decrease of 5.2% between 9 and 24 May.
China seems not be behind this global decline since prices rose there - down during this period.
The standard explanations of economists concern monetary policy.
In the wake of the great fear of deflation of 2003, central banks around the world have reduced interest rates, causing speculative explosions on the real estate markets and the stock exchange.
But today, according to this point of view, increase interest rates begin to take effect, which portends of new declines in the markets.
There is no doubt an important element of truth in this argument.
The US Federal Reserve increased its rate of 10 interest and its Chairman, Ben Bernanke, then indicated that further increases could occur in the future.
On 17 may, a worsening of the U.S. data was reported, suggesting future monetary hardening.
Economists like to think that the world is logical and manageable, which implies that they understand what is happening.
But in doing so, they often exaggerate the role of central banks.
Indeed, the increase in US rates was that register in a series of rate increases - the 16th in a row.
No other major Central Bank increased its rates after the beginning of the decline of the stock markets in May until 7-8 June, date when more is there are established (the European Central Bank, the India, South Korea, South Africa, the Thailand and the Turkey).
Another factor: the price of oil, which increased by 24% between March 22 and may 2, beating all its records.
This is who would undoubtedly constitute a major event can influence the markets around the world.
The price of oil increases role the culprit in virtually all economic recessions since World War II.
And yet, the flights of the oil prices do not correspond to the time where stock prices have more than dropped in mid - May.
Advance that these increases have caused declines in markets implies a lag of several weeks.
But the stock markets are not very logical, and a response shifted to the oil price shock might be possible.
As for all courses in any financial market, an increase always attracts attention.
When oil prices rise quickly, people look at information that talk about and discuss among themselves these increases, creating a heightened sensitivity to these news by themselves.
The crisis in the Middle - East is linked to the price of oil, and it has been the dominant information of the month of May.
Signs of ill omen and the language highly used by various political figures could be amplified in the minds of investors by increases in the price of oil.
On 8 may, the vice - Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, in reaction to the hostile statements of the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, told that "the president of Iran should remember that the Iran could also be wiped off the map".
Similarly, around the beginning of the stock market fall in the month of may, Ahmadinejad visited the Indonesia, the country with the greatest number of Muslims in the world, and the newspapers reported on May 13 that he had received a genuine ovation from students of two of the country's best universities.
This story may have been interpreted as evidence that the strategy of brinkmanship of Ahmadinejad in the nuclear field brings him political dividends, fueling the perception that the tense situation in the Middle - East could lead to further increases in the price of oil.
These newspaper articles can seem much farther from stock markets as monetary policy.
But the public reaction they generate, as well as recent oil price increases, could enter the change in the psychology of the market for a good measure.
Risk attitudes change over time, and events like the comments d Ahmedinejad and fathers can precipitate these changes.
Therefore, although difficult to quantify, these events may be the analysts should - they pay also attention to the words of Ahmadinejad than those of Bernanke when they try to understand the direction taken by global stock markets.
Economists like may not be focusing on the mentality of the public and how it interacts with the fluctuations in prices, global news and speculative dynamics.
This would imply that economic events are less predictable (and economists less omniscient) like to imagine.
However, from an intuitive standpoint it makes sense to do so.
What is he really in the minds of investors?
Ahmadinejad is a charismatic character, steps Bernanke.
Ahmadinejad embarks on an adventure, not Bernanke.
And, may be the most important, Ahmadinejad has a destabilizing impact, step Bernanke.
Regardless of their cause in the end, global stock falls from mi - may indicate an unstable market psychology.
Hard to believe that they were related to opinions regarding monetary policy possible, and not broader and deeper, questions concerning in particular the energy and political tension, which are the bases of the performance of the world economy.
Why pay more for fair trade?
Marks & Spencer, the chain of supermarkets and clothing owner of 400 stores through la Grande - Bretagne, has announced that it would convert its full range of coffees and teas including 38 different products with the label "Fair trade", the marketing of the 'ethical production' symbol.
The chain already sells only tea and coffee bearing this label in these 200 coffee shops "CafÃ© Revive".
It also encourages the purchase of shirts and other goods made from Fairtrade cotton.
The announcement took place during the "fair trade fortnight". During these two weeks of promotion of labelled products, presentation sessions were organized with developing country producers to explain the British how this form of trade has helped their communities.
The movement towards a more ethical consumption is also experiencing a significant advance in the States - United. Consumers are turning more and more organic foods or products locally, such as the eggs of hens raised free-range.
The Kingdom - UK, a study showed that more than 50% of the interviewees recognized the symbol of fair trade and understood that the products bearing this label meet more producers of third - world working conditions.
Currently, there is no comparable to States - United, but reported data studies and the discussions I have had with my own students suggest that the figure would be lower for Americans.
Traders seeking Fairtrade certification must pay producers a price covering the costs of sustainable production and a sufficient salary to live.
For example, the minimum price for a pound of coffee is $1.26, regardless of the decrease of the level of the market price.
If the market price exceeds this number, the tariff for fair trade will increase to remain higher than the 5 cents / book.
With regard to small producers, they must organize themselves in cooperatives or other types of groups for democratic participation.
Plantations and factories can avail themselves of the fair trade label if they offer their workers decent wages, if they conform to standards, health, environmental and security, if they allow unionism or any other form of workers associations, if they provide accommodation worthy to workers who work away from home and if they use or forced labour, nor child labour.
However, everyone does not approve the fair trade.
Brink Lindsey, Director of the centre for studies on the trade policies of the Cato Institute, agency pro - market, finds that the campaign for fair trade Certified coffee is "dead-end paved with good intentions".
It is explained in justifying the real cause of the fall of coffee prices is not in the realization of profiteering by the multinationals, but rising considerable production of coffee to the Brazil and the Viet Nam, combined with new techniques of culture coffee, working less and therefore at a lower cost.
From the perspective of Lindsey, if we want to help the coffee growers, we encourage them to abandon the coffee to turn to more profitable crops - he insists here, rightly, on the commercial restrictions imposed by rich countries and subsidies which constitute obstacles must be removed - or toward high value-added productssuch as specialty coffees that can be paid more expensive.
What is strange in Lindsey's argument, however, is that the campaign for fair trade coffee seems to do exactly what he recommends, it means encouraging coffee farmers to produce specialty coffees that can be paid more expensive.
Pro - market economists do not preclude companies openly using the lure of luxury to promote their products.
If people are willing to spend $48 for a pound of coffee Jamaican Blue Mountain, because it is the favorite coffee of James Bond, the economists did not consider, in this case, that the market is distorted.
So, why be so critical to consumers who want to pay $12 for a pound of coffee that they know that it has been grown without pesticide, under shady trees favourable to the survival of the birds, by producers who can now feed and educate their children decently?
Economists could replicate that if we want to help people to feed and educate their children, it is possible to buy a pound of non - fair trade coffee to the same taste for $10 and pay the $2 remaining to a charity that distributes food and education poor children.
This is actually a possible strategy. However, fair trade presents real advantages.
The producers know that they must make a popular cafÃ© in consumers not only for its taste but also for the way in which it is grown.
If their coffee sells well, they are proud to have manufactured a product sought after all over the world.
From the point of view of the farmers, receive a premium by selling a product labeled fair trade is preferable to the getting a charitable help they would receive anyway, whether they work or not, and regardless of the quality of their production.
Pay more for a product labeled fair trade is not more "anti - market" than spend more to buy a Gucci brand product.
In addition, this label reflects better ethical priorities.
It is not only a grant provided by the Governments, its success depending on the demand of the market and not the lobbying policy.
Fortunately, in Europe, this demand is growing rapidly.
Hope that it will quickly such levels reach everywhere in the developed countries, where consumers can decide freely how to spend their money.
Pigs, calves, and American democracy.
Among the flood of titles on the return of the Democrat majority in Congress after the November elections, the result of an important election has gone largely unnoticed.
Although it has highlighted the shortcomings of the American political system, it has also allowed me to believe again in the compassion of ordinary American citizens.
In Arizona, citizens can, if they have brought together a sufficient number of signatures, submit a draft law to the direct popular vote.
This year, one of the questions submitted by popular suffrage was a law to prohibit that pregnant sows, or calves reared for meat, are strapped or confined in a way that prevents them from turning freely, lie down or stretch their limbs.
Those who do not know the methods of intensive livestock amaze may be the need for such legislation.
Traditional livestock farming, as it is practiced everywhere in the world fifty years ago, and in some countries today, allows the animals to move and stretch.
But today, nearly 90 per cent of the sows - mothers of the pigs raised and slaughtered for meat, bacon and ham - spend most of their life in stalls which measure approximately 60 centimeters by 2, 2 m.
They cannot turn, extend their once-folded legs, nor forward or backward over a step.
They are also sometimes strapped to restrict their movements.
In the same way the calves are confined their lifetime in individual stalls where they cannot turn around, lie down or stretch.
Basically, these methods are designed to save labor costs. They facilitate the management of animals and allow to employ fewer workers and less skilled.
They also prevent animals wasting energy in to deplacdant or fighting among themselves.
A few years ago, following protests from animal rights organizations, the Commission of the European Union requested a report to the Standing Veterinary Committee of the EU on intensive farming methods.
The conclusions of the report indicate that the animals suffer from not being able to move and boredom of having nothing to whole days.
Of course, the simple common sense to arrive at the same conclusions.
In response to the report, the EU has set the dates from which the containment of farmed animals will be prohibited.
For calves, January 1, 2007.
Individual for sows, already prohibited stalls in the Kingdom - Uni and in Sweden, will be banned from 2013 throughout the European Union.
Measures to improve the welfare of hens, hens kept in battery cages truss without enough room to extend their wings, are also applied gradually.
States - United, nothing of the kind is expected.
Previously, when my European friends asked me why States - United accused such a delay in the well-being of livestock from Europe, I knew that answer.
If they insisted, I well say that one possible explanation was that Americans cared less animals than Europeans.
Then, in 2002, associations for the defence of animals managed to submit to popular vote a proposal to ban individual stalls for sows in Florida.
To General surprise, the proposal was accepted by 55 percent of voters.
Last month in Arizona, despite opposition generously funded by the agri-food industry, the ban on the boxes of containment for calves and pigs was also approved, by 62 percent of voters.
Neither Florida nor Arizona only are particularly progressive States â both voted for George W. Bush against John Kerry in 2004.
The results of these two popular votes so strongly suggest that if all Americans should take a decision on the maintenance of pregnant sows and calves in containment, a large majority oppose.
Ultimately, it seems that Americans are concerned about as much as Europeans to the living conditions of farmed animals.
To explain the difference between the welfare of livestock in Europe and the States - United, it is undoubtedly necessary to compare political systems.
In Europe, the concerns of voters about the living conditions of animals have found an echo among members of national parliaments and the European Parliament, with result the adoption of national legislation and EU directives to improve their lot.
States - United on the other hand, these same concerns had no visible effect on members of Congress.
There is no federal legislation on the welfare of farmed animals and virtually no legislation at the State level.
AB my opinion, tens of millions of dollars of the agri-food industry pocketed by officials seeking to be re-elected there is for something.
The movement for the defence of animals, despite strong popular support, does not weight in the arena of political lobbying and election donations.
In American electoral races, money is more important than the opinion of voters.
Party discipline is weak and delegates must collect themselves the bulk of funds for their re-election - in this case, every two years for members of the House of representatives.
In Europe, where party discipline is respected and where parties, and not the candidates, finance election campaigns, money plays a less important role.
States - United, a country proud of its democratic tradition, calves and pigs are by far not the only losers.
What's new on the new army made up entirely of Afghans?
The assassination of the afghan Minister of Aviation by a mob (can - be incited by members of the interim administration of Afghanistan) shows that Afghan society remains deeply fissured.
The first reforms on Afghan army will be only accentuate the divisions.
The Minister of defence of the temporary administration of Hamid Karzai in Kabul has already designated senior officers of this new army.
The Minister general Mohammed Fahim is a Tajik from the Panjshir district in the North, which became three months earlier the head of the Northern Alliance forces who captured Kabul after American bombers have cleared their path.
As a group, his assignment constitutes a direct challenge to the goal of reunification of the country by Mr. Karzai.
The Afghanistan is a nation of pluri - ethnic, the largest group being Pashtuns, representing two-fifths of the total population.
The Hazara and the Tajiks are a fifth of the population, respectively.
Thirty-eight officers elevated to the rank of general by Mr. Fahim, thirty - seven are Tajiks, the thirty le trente-huitieme etant un uzbek - eighth being a Uzbek.
If, on the fifteen to ten - seven million Pashtuns in the country, some are recruited as soldiers, they will serve under a command structure made up almost entirely of Tajiks.
The language of the Pashtuns differed from the tajik as Spanish and English, and millions of Pashtuns reaching the age of military service have to better than a few notions of tajik.
The geographic profile of the new military authority is also limited as its ethnic composition.
Thirty - five on thirty-eight senior officers are native to a small area north of Kabul consisting of Parwan province (where is located Bagram airport) and the nearby Panjshir Valley, along the stronghold of the Northern Alliance.
In other words, potential leaders from twenty - seven of the twenty-nine provinces of Afghanistan have been excluded from the new military elite of their countries.
If small group could possibly overcome the impression that its members are a clique closed if they represented a large sample of the dozen of political parties of the country.
But this is not the case.
Eighteen of the thirty-eight senior officers come from a single party, Jamiat - e - Islami, the Islamic faction that has long been led by Mullah and former Professor of theology Burhanuddin Rabbani.
It was this party that ruled Kabul briefly in the mid 1990s, creating carnage and chaos that led most afghans to welcome the coming of the Taliban.
The Communists almost equal the number of members of Jamiat in the military hierarchy.
Sixteen of the thirty-eight officers have long aligned themselves with this party tricks at the end of the 1970s led to the Soviet invasion of 1979 - 89 which cost two million and a half of Afghan lives.
Today, most Afghans consider the Communists with the same degree of sympathy that Czechs or poles reserve for the National Socialists of Hitler.
It is true that Afghans, as elsewhere, joined the Communist Party for various reasons and that they were all hardened ideologues.
But in the case of general Fahim's generals, six were professional workers of the Communist Party and continued to serve the party after the invasion of the Red Army.
The six men, three Communists who served as officers in the Afghan army, collaborated actively during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, which lasted a decade.
Imagine how the French would have reacted if a quarter of the french officer corps of the after - WWII is were stowed on the side of the Wehrmacht while celle - ci occupied their country.
In Afghanistan, the news travels quickly by word of mouth.
Afghan nationalists (IE - - almost all Afghans) will soon discover the political reasons of the members of the inner circle of general Fahim, if it is not already selected.
Even this overwhelming evidence of bias and prejudice in the formation of the high command of the new army could be neutralized if the generals included a professionalism and a commitment to the patriotic values of truly national armed forces in their task.
Unfortunately, only ten of the thirty-eight officers promoted by Fahim have been trained of professional military officers.
An eleventh was used as a pilot.
By contrast, twenty - four on the thirty-eight generals (formations of the four remaining generals remain unknown) are civilians, who had a profession, coming from the Communist Party or, in one case, offices which were Mullah.
What do all these statistics in terms of everyday reality?
They mean that when the heads of the international forces to keep the peace in Afghanistan, as well as military officials and diplomatic Americans, meet the Deputy afghan Minister of defence, they will encounter Abdul Rashid Dostum, a warlord and a notoriously brutal and corrupt Communist who remains in contact with old friends of the Red Army which are still used in Moscow.
This means that the head of Afghan armed forces so that the Chief of operations and the Chief of the army intelligence service are also Communists, men whose loyalty remain uncertain and many Afghans are wary.
This team it is likely to unite a war-torn Afghanistan?
The presence in Kabul of a such a dubious team it is likely to inspire confidence in all three - quarters of the Afghan population who are excluded from the military high command?
Or this list is rather the harvest of an approach "all for the winner" of the Government which is obliged (at some point in the future) to unleash another bloody national backlash by those whose legitimate interests have been cynically trampled?
The United Nations and European and American policymakers must meditate on these issues before you agree to a takeover of power relentless by a small unpopular minority.
Celebration of the irrational.
Hooray for the new winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics: Daniel Kahneman of Princeton University and Vernon Smith of George Mason of Virginia University.
As of many Nobel Prize, these awards recognize not only the important work undertaken by Mr. Kahneman and Smith, but also schools of thoughts that they helped to develop.
Mr. Kahneman, psychologist, showed that individuals behave consistently less classically that traditional economists believe.
His work shows not only that individuals sometimes act differently than standard economic theoretical predictions, but also that they do so regularly, systematically, and in a way that can be understood and interpreted through different assumptions that come into competition with those used by traditional economists.
For most of the actors of the market, and in fact ordinary observers, this doesn't seem to make much difference.
Wall Street brokers who traffic with actions that they know to be bad exploit the irrational demonstrated by Mr. Kahneman and Smith.
A large part of the craze that led to swelling markets was based on the exploitation of the psychology of investors.
In fact, this irrationality is not new for economists either.
John Maynard Keynes once described the stock market as being not based on rational individuals struggle to discover the foundations of markets, but rather as in a beauty contest in which the winner is the one who guesses the best those judges will say.
The Nobel this year celebrates the critique of simplistic market economy, like that of last year (that I got with two other colleagues).
The winners of last year placed emphasis on the fact that the different players in the market have different (and imperfect) information, and that this information asymmetry has a marked impact on the functioning of the economy.
Specifically, the winners of the year last sub - meant that the markets are in general not effective; It remains to Governments a great role to play.
The invisible hand of Adam Smith, the idea that free trade leads to efficiency as guided by an invisible hand, is invisible in part because it does not exist.
This, too, is not a new fact for those who work daily with the markets (and make fortune by taking advantage of this asymmetry of information and the excess).
For more than twenty years, economists became passionate about these so-called - models "of rational forecasts" which assumed that all stakeholders have the same (even imperfect) information and act perfectly rationally, that markets are perfectly efficient, there was never no unemployment (except when it is caused by greedy unions or minimum wages imposed by Governments), and that there is never any rationing of funding.
Such models are predominant, especially in States postgraduate courses - United, despite evidence to the contrary that demonstrate the triumph of ideology on science.
Unfortunately, these programs of higher education students today are policy-makers in many countries and they are trying to implement programs based on these ideas, today known as market fundamentalism.
Let - me to be quite clear here: rational prediction models have contributed significantly to economic theory. rigour that their supporters have imposed on economic thinking helped highlight the weakness of many assumptions underlying.
Any good scientific thinking recognizes its limits, but the prophets of rational forecasts have generally shown little modesty.
Vernon Smith is a leader in the development of experimental economics, the idea that one can test many economic proposals in a laboratory.
One of the reasons that make the economy is a complex subject, which also explains the many disagreements among economists, is that economists cannot conduct controlled experiments.
Nature imbalance the life-size experiments, but in most circumstances, so many things can change so quickly that it is often difficult to disentangle the causes of the consequences.
In principle, in a laboratory, can conduct controlled experiments, and thereby generate more reliable inferences.
Critics of experimental economics worry that subjects bring to experimental contexts of the modes of thought determined outside experience, and thus experiences and inferences are not as detached and clear than in the physical sciences.
Nevertheless, economic experiments provide some knowledge of a large number of issues, such as improved design of auctions.
Above all, the irrationality of the actors of the market, the main issue of the work of Mr. Kahneman, is checked repeatedly in the context of the laboratories.
One of the most entertaining results from experimental economics notes of altruism and selfishness.
It would seem (at least in experimental situations) that experimental subjects are not as selfish as economists think, apart from a group: that of economists itself.
Could this be because the economy is a discipline that attracts individuals who are, by nature, selfish or even because the economy allows to mould individuals so as to make them more selfish?
The answer, certainly, surely a bit of both lies.
Without a doubt, that experimental research and future work will resolve this question of the relative importance of these two hypotheses.
Nobel Prize shows how it is important to study individuals and economies as they are and not as we want to see.
Is that by better understanding real human behaviour can we hope to design policies that will also do better operate our economies.
Bush and his energy policy in bad faith.
An episode of the surreal happened, this year, during the World Economic Forum in Davos. Experts from the oil industry are explained that the melting of the polar icecap - much faster than all announced forecast - is not only a problem, but also a chance in that huge new amounts of oil will now be accessible.
Similarly, these specialists have recognized that the refusal of the States - United to sign the law of the sea, the international convention that determines access to the sources of offshore oil as well as other maritime mineral resources, represents a risk of international conflict.
However, they also stressed the benefits: the oil industry, in its incessant of new reserves quest, does not need beg Congress for the right to pillage Alaska.
President George W. Bush has an uncanny ability to not understand the important messages.
For years, it is increasingly evident that its energy policy is wrong.
Some members of his party refer even to a former Energy Bill drafted by the oil industry, as being very beneficial for all lobbyists.
Wearing nude the virtues of the market economy, the only purpose of Bush is to grant huge subsidies to the oil industry, despite the growing deficits which the country faces.
However, the market does not work properly when it comes to energy. The intervention of the Government should take a totally opposite to the one proposed by the Bush administration.
A devaluation of the price of energy and suddenly, excessive consumption causes that Americans do not pay the price of pollution - and especially of their huge production of greenhouse gases - from their energy wastage.
The Government must encourage energy savings. His intervention on the fixing of prices, mainly through energy taxes is an effective method to do so.
But rather than promote energy savings, Bush persists in a policy which is to "first dry America" from its own resources, making it in the future even more dependent on external oil resources.
No matter that strong demand will climb the price of oil and thus creates a windfall for many countries of the Middle East, who are not the best friends of America.
Now, more than four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, it seems that Bush has finally taken the measure of the increasing energy dependence of America. It had become difficult for him to not to see the consequences of the galloping rise of the oil prices.
But, once again, tentative gestures of his Government will inevitably exacerbate problems in the immediate future.
Bush still refuses to act in favour of energy savings and ultimately spends very little money to support his continual technological salvation prayer.
What, then, of Bush's recent statement on its commitment to reduce the oil dependency of America on the Middle East by 75% within 25 years?
For investors, the message is clear: invest more in new reserves of the Middle East, which are by far the least expensive oil resources of the world.
However, if there is no new investment in the reserves of the Middle East, the uncontrolled growth of energy consumption in the States - United, in China and elsewhere implies that demand exceeds supply.
And to top it all, the threat of Bush against the Iran sanctions could cause interruption of the supply of one of the largest producers in the world.
With a global level of oil production almost to its maximum and prices that have nearly doubled since the war in Iraq, this portends still higher prices and more profits for the oil industry, the only real winner of Bush in the Middle - East policy.
Whatever the case, no one should blame Bush for recognizing that there's a problem.
But, as always, its proposals are nothing more that a small tour of past - passes its administration.
In addition to his refusal to admit the warming of the planet, to encourage energy conservation or to allocate sufficient funds to advance research, the great promise of Bush to reduce the U.S. dependence on oil from the Middle - East doesn't mean much.
With only 20% of American oil extracted in the Middle - East, the objective of Bush could simply be achieved by modestly increasing supply from other regions of the world.
The Bush administration must realize that oil takes advantage of the global market.
Although America was completely independent of oil from the Middle East, the reduction of energy production in this region would have devastating effects on world prices and a fortiori on the U.S. economy.
As is too often the case with the Bush administration, there is no clear explanation of the official policy.
Bush is - it playing with politics stirring anti - Arab and anti - Iranian sentiment of Americans?
Or is this yet another example of incompetence and confusion?
Based on what we saw these past five years, the correct answer contains certainly more than a bit of bad faith and pure stupidity.
The roadmap of China.
China is about to adopt its 11th five-year plan, drawing up the decor to extend what is probably the more remarkable history, economic transformation in improving the well being of nearly a quarter of the world's population.
Never before the world had known as sustainable growth; never before there was - it had such a reduction of poverty.
The explanation of the long term success of China partially lies in its unique combination of pragmatism and vision for the future.
While much of the rest of the developing world, following the Washington Consensus, is launched in a worthy of Don Quixote quest for GDP, China once more clearly established that it was seeking increases in sustainable and more equitable in actual life levels.
China realizes that it is entering a phase of economic growth imposing huge requirements on the environment which will not last.
Less than change the trajectory, living standards will eventually be compromised.
It is for this reason that the new five-year plan really focuses on the environment.
Many parts of China among the most backward grew so fast that one cry to wonder if other parts of the country were growing faster still.
While this phenomenon has reduced poverty, inequality increased, with growing disparities between rural and urban areas, and between regions on sides and Interior.
The report of this year's World Bank World Development Report explains why inequality, not only poverty, should give rise to concern; now China's 11th five-year plan is frontally addressing the problem.
The Government mentions several years a more harmonious society, and the plan describes ambitious programs to achieve this goal.
China also recognizes that what separates less developed countries of the more developed countries is not only a disparity of resources but also knowledge.
It has therefore established bold projects to reduce these disparities and create a basis for independent innovation.
The role of China in the world and in the world economy has changed, and the plan also reflects this situation.
Future growth will have to rely more on domestic demand than on exports, which implies an increase in consumption.
Indeed, China suffers from a rare problem: excessive savings.
People save partly because of weaknesses in government social insurance programs: strengthening social security (pensions), public health and education will simultaneously reduce social inequalities, increase the sense of well - being of the citizens and promote current consumption.
If it worked (and so far China has almost always surpassed even his own high expectations) these adjustments may impose enormous pressure on a global economic system already destabilized by the enormous imbalances fiscal and trade of States - United.
If China starts to less spare - and, as announced it its representatives, it pursues a more diversified investment policy of its reserves, which will finance the trade deficit of more than 2 billion dollars a day from the States - United?
It is a subject to be addressed another day, but that day is may be not so distant.
With a clearer vision of the future, the challenge will be in the implementation.
China is a big country, which could not succeed as well without a broad decentralization.
But decentralization raises problems of its own.
Greenhouse gases, for example, are global problems.
While America proclaims that she doesn't have the means to do anything on this subject, the most senior Chinese officials have acted more responsibly.
In the space of one month after the adoption of the plan, new environmental taxes on cars, gasoline and wood products have been imposed: China uses the market mechanisms to solve its environmental problems and those of the world.
But the pressures on officials of local governments so that they create economic growth and jobs will be enormous.
They will be very tempted to say that if America is not capable of producing to protect our planet, how them it could - they?
To translate this vision into action, the Chinese Government will need strong policies, including increases in substantial taxes on the environment.
While China transformed into a market economy, she saw to develop some problems that are the bane of developed countries: the specific interests concealing personal interests under a mask of market ideology.
Some evoke the trickle - down effect: worry not for the poor, in the end everyone will eventually benefit from the growth.
And others oppose the competition policies and the strict laws of corporate governance: let Darwinism work its wonders.
Growth arguments will be advanced to counter strong social and environmental policies: for example, increase taxes on gasoline will kill our nascent auto industry.
Such policies soi - saying pro - growth fail not only to provide growth, they would threaten all of the vision of the future of China.
There is only one way to avoid this: open discussion of economic policies in order to unveil the sophistries and give the means to implement creative solutions to the many challenges that China faces today.
George W. Bush has shown as it is dangerous to abuse of secrecy and restricting decision-making to a narrow circle of sycophants.
Most people outside of China do not render account how its leaders, on the other hand, are engaged in extensive discussions and extensive consultations (even with strangers) while they struggled to solve the huge problem they are facing.
Market economies are not auto - regulatory.
They cannot simply be left in automatic pilot, especially if we want to ensure that their benefits are widely shared.
But managing a market economy is not easy.
It is a balancing act that must constantly respond to economic changes.
China's 11th five-year plan provides a roadmap in this sense.
The world opens the eyes, full of hope and fear, while the lives of 1.3 billion people continue to be transformed.
Lessons on democracy in Tocqueville.
Because of the war in Iraq, 200 years after de Tocqueville's birth, the world discusses the nature of democracy.
Tocqueville is famous rightly for rejecting reactionary nostalgia in considering that democracy was our destiny, we however alerting to the dangers it presents to liberty.
Must - share us his concern?
Tocqueville did not consider democracy first as a political system, but above all as an intellectual system that shapes the habits and customs of society, giving thus a sociological and psychological dimension.
Tocqueville believed that democratic regimes guide the course of our thoughts, our desires and our passions.
And there was the Renaissance man and in the 20th century the homo sovieticus, "democratic man" is a form of human beings.
For Tocqueville, the systemic effects of democracy can lead citizens to renounce their faculty of reasoning.
They can only pretend to judge events and values by them - same, whereas in fact they just repeat the reductive opinions of the majority.
What Tocqueville called the stranglehold of "social power" opinion is no doubt stronger in democratic regimes - a point of view that foreshadowed the level of demagoguery and manipulation by the media in the modern world.
Tocqueville believed that in the long term, nothing can really oppose this trend.
Local democracy nor small groups within the society, nor against - powers, nor civil rights cannot prevent the decline of critical thinking that democracy seems to cause.
The school is at best an enclave away from the irresistible influence that society exerts on the mind.
In the same way, Tocqueville thought that searching of virtue like elders or a religious faith could sometimes elevate the soul, but one and the other are incompatible with the democratic ideal at the moment they are imposed by the authorities in the context of public life.
In this sense, theorists neo - Marxists of the Frankfurt School and Hannah Arendt who feared by - above all the demise of reason in modern societies are the heirs of the thought of Tocqueville.
You can also note that the french philosopher Marcel Gauchet entitled one of these recent books democracy against it - even.
For these authors, the democratic way of life tends to eliminate any original thought and to prevent the emergence of a culture of good level, yielding the place to a mediocrity that leaves vulnerable citizens against the enemies of democracy.
If history abounds with criminal regimes supported by masses intimidated and manipulated, the greatest risk of democratic countries is to see their citizens sink into indifference and confined to a short-term thinking in the search for their immediate interest.
The past â despite rituals that are aimed at the commemoration of historical events - is hidden by dependence on the present moment and the latest news.
Even the ruling class, supposedly well educated, is a victim of this grip.
The main problem of the democratic mentality lies in its lack of historical consciousness.
As stated Tocqueville, democracy defects are - they resigned pessimism the only way - realistic but unacceptable - which opens to us?
I do not think so.
There are ways to combat what could be called the "democratic stupidity" that we see spread today.
The first of these ways is to develop an educational system that forms from real critics, including through the teaching of materials largely neglected (nowadays) that are literature, history and philosophy.
If one wants to train citizens informed and able to think for themselves, which is essential to the functioning of democracy, our schools must stop chasing the latest current fashions and start developing the analysis capabilities of the students.
Because of their tendency to grow the superficial and distraction, the mass media are the main obstacle to such an education.
Today, many people spend more time during the course of their lives watching TV than in a classroom.
The passivity that mass media induce is the exact opposite of the active engagement of the citizens, for democracy.
But it is hard to imagine that the mass media (apart from the quality newspapers) accept voluntarily to become the tools of education which would develop the critical spirit of the citizens.
This focus on the mass media does not an elitist disdain for popular culture.
It is not only a question of popularity - Mozart was popular at its time and Shakespeare's plays attracted the poor as much as the rich - but the refusal of mass culture to challenge and provoke.
As a result, indifference and a widespread passivity of the public.
Long, a globalized media culture is spreading more and more, unable to initiate the slightest criticism or raise feelings.
Because of his lack of interest in these issues, it is a culture that threatens democratic freedoms because it creates a sense of duty to society, history, or the community in any way.
Is - it too late to defend against a culture that dulls the spirits at this point?
Tocqueville despised the elites of his time due to their complacency against the dangers of mass democracy.
The shortsightedness of our leaders will promote the realization of his disquieting prophecy?
A Europe for all.
Longtime EU members appeared to doubt the future of the European Union, but the Ukrainians look European Union with some hope and a certain admiration.
The fundamental objective of our foreign policy is to join the European progress, because the Ukraine found that national autonomy is not an end in itself but a simple beginning.
In fact, European unity is indivisible: when a nation is a victim of ostracism, no nation is free.
We, European, all linked by a link which we cannot escape, linked by a single destiny.
All aspects of culture that we share, not to mention the century of suffering that we share, confirm us this.
Everything that affects one European directly affects all indirectly.
We cannot ever afford to live with the narrow concepts of two Europes, a haves and a Europe of poor, elect and outcasts.
Anyone who lives on the European continent today cannot, indeed must, be considered to be a stranger to his Union.
The great Pax Europa of today, like the present pan-European prosperity, depends on it.
Some may of course argue that the Ukraine is not part of Europe.
They come to Kiev and met its inhabitants, young and old, workers, the wives of farmers, lawyers and doctors and teachers who stood and remained standing in the cold and snow for weeks to defend their freedoms last winter.
Are - they not United to those who gathered around general Charles de Gaulle in the French Resistance?
Do - they not body with those who died in the fight for the defence of the Spanish Republic in the 1930s, those who liberated Budapest in 1956 and ended fascism in Spain and the Portugal in the 1970s?
Are - they not animated by the same spirit as that of the Polish trade union solidarity and the peaceful masses that began the Velvet Revolution in Prague in 1989?
This is where the true soul of Europe and no doubt cannot destroy it.
All those who consider that the Ukraine is too behind to become a member of the Union, I will say this: that they come also visit my country and see the mothers who stay up late at the office to teach their children the use of their desktop.
They just attend the language course of every village and town where our youth prepares for Europe by learning the french, German and English.
Those who doubt the European vocation of the Ukraine should understand that Europe is not a simple matter of material and motorways: it is the insatiable desire of freedom, prosperity and solidarity.
I believe that our future is promising that the past of Europe is proud, and that our intended is not that of a frontier land forgotten in a troubled region but one influential member of the peace and unity of Europe.
Self-determination is more synonymous with insulation because achieving national independence nowadays means simply the return on the world stage with a new status.
The new nations can build with their former occupiers the same kind of fruitful relationship that the France was established with the Germany: a relationship based on equality and mutual interests.
This is the type of relationship that my Government wants to establish with the Russia, so we can help extend the zone of peace in Europe.
It is premature, of course, to go to the - beyond of the indication of the high regard that we attach to the possibility of entering the European Union.
We know that our role in this great building will not be in one night.
We know that the great work of European unification is not limited to documents and statements but rooted in innovative action designed to improve living standards and bring security to all Europeans.
Build a Ukraine worthy of joining the European Union will not be easy or quick, or effortlessly.
But just as the European Union it - even, it will be built and it will be.
We know that the challenge is great but the game is worth the candle, and Europe must understand that this is our goal.
The renovation of the Ukraine passes partly by an innovative battle to put an end to a nightmarish century during which fascism and communism, ideologies born in the heart of Europe, battled to take power.
Through the Ukrainian cities a few months ago, parents and children faced armed troops, snarling dogs, and even death.
Only a few years ago, a young journalist, Georgi Gongadze, seeking to inform the public about the corruption of our former regime, was brutalized and beheaded by henchmen of the regime.
Our orange Revolution, last winter, has proven that the Ukraine and its people could prevail.
Thus, despite the doubts and difficulties, I keep an unwavering confidence in Europe.
I refuse to accept despair as the final response to ambiguities and horrors of the history of the Ukraine.
I refuse to accept the idea that the Ukraine is so tragically condemned to live in the middle of the night without stars of the Communist legacy could never see the point of the day of peace and a true European unity.
When the citizens of the European Union reflect instead of the Ukraine in Europe, they will have to consider closely and know to look at the - beyond of the face that we will show them.
See to-beyond of the devastated areas that we imposed communism, to the - beyond poverty and social divisions through which our veterans today repudies leaders have sought to extend their grip.
They must consider closely the face of our president, Victor Ioutchenko, ravaged by poison that was given during the election campaign last year, and remember the words of this great French was AndrÃ© Malraux, for whom "the most beautiful faces are those that one was injured".
The Muslim civil war.
The gap between Sunnis and Shiites in the Middle - East is - it now deeper than the antagonism between Israel and the Arabs?
You might think upon seeing the reaction of some Arab Governments to decisions of Hezbollah to attack Israel.
While Israeli bombs falling on Beirut and tyre, the Saudi Arabia, may be the most conservative Muslim Arab State of all, has openly condemned the Shiite Hezbollah that initiated the war against Israel.
Never before in the history of the Israeli - Arab conflict, a State which considers itself the leader of the Muslim Arab people did support Israel so openly.
In addition, the failure of Saudi Arabia with Hezbollah is not a unique case.
The Egypt and the Jordan also categorically condemned Hezbollah and its leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, for their adventurism.
What is there behind this amazing situation?
Money - we're living a fundamental turning point in relations between Arab nationalism and Islamic sectarianism?
The Sunni Government of Saudi Arabia feels - he more of fear and concern about Shiite Islam he was involved in Arab unity and the Palestinian cause?
Denunciations of Hezbollah by Arabs suggest that the Muslim sectarian divide already evident in the daily violence in Iraq widens and intensifies through the Middle East.
The willingness of president George W. Bush to destroy the frozen societies in the Arab world was doomed to draw up the forces of modernization against the traditional elements of Islamic and Arab societies.
It seems instead released the most atavistic forces of the region.
The opening of this Pandora's box was able to give birth to an even more horrible era of widespread violence, in what can only be described as without doubt that of "Muslim civil war".
The Shiite - Sunni divide has existed since the dawn of the history of Islam, but isolation, geographical and ethnic Shiite Iran non - Arabic, as well as the domination of their Shia minorities by the Sunni Arab countries, has generally left this rivalry back - plan.
These tensions have receded further when the wave "Islamization" created by the Iranian revolution, because in its wake the sectarian Sunni identity Arabs has been further extended to - background that appeared a generalized 'Islamic' assertion.
That all changed when Al Qaeda, a Sunni terrorist group that draws heavily from ideology and personnel Saudi wahabbites, launched his attacks on America in September 2001.
A specifically Sunni branch of militant Islam was running.
When States - United have launched wars at once against the Sunni in Afghanistan Taliban and the Iraqi Sunni regime, this new radical Sunni trend has acquired more daring yet.
The Sunni Arabs of the region, who have now won in insurance, see Israel and the West as a single threat, the other comprising the so-called "Shia Crescent"-the arc of land which extends from Lebanon to the Iran through the Syria and Iraq, inhabited by the supposedly heretical Shiites.
The leaders of Saudi Arabia, as guardians of the sacred sites of the Muslim faith of Mecca and Medina, feel may be this threat more acutely.
For Sunnis, the Shiites do not just to dominate Iran oil-rich regions, Iraq and parts of East of Saudi Arabia, they try too, by the acts of Hezbollah, to usurp the role of "protector" of the central dream of all Arabs, the Palestinian cause.
This is because the Saudi royal family derives its legitimacy from a strict form of Sunni islam and questioned the loyalty of its Shiite population that the Kingdom departs from Hezbollah.
The irony of the thing, it is that America, protector of long-standing Saudi Arabia, has made taking possible Shiite responsibility by overthrowing Saddam Hussein and putting Shiite parties in power in Iraq.
The Bush administration seems to recognize what she has done. as the Shia arc rises in the East of the Arab Muslim world, States - United attempt to consolidate their protection of the Sunni arc - the Egypt, the Jordan and Saudi Arabia--to the West of the region.
Israel, once enemy relentless of the Arab cause, seems today embedded in this defensive structure.
But such a defensive position is inevitably unstable, by the sole fact of the Pan-Arab sentiments.
Today, ordinary Saudi citizens depart not Al Jazeera and other Arab satellite TV networks to monitor events in Gaza and South of the Lebanon.
They see Arab blood (Shiite steps), and only Hezbollah to respond.
For them, Hezbollah has become a heroic model of resistance.
This situation pushed the Saudi State to enlarge the Sunni - Shiite schism.
After the official denunciation of Hezbollah by the Kingdom, the Saudi State has asked its official Wahhabi clerics to issue fatwas condemning Hezbollah as a heretic and Shiite deviant.
Such sentences may only exacerbate sectarian divisions within Saudi Arabia and the region.
Before the aggravation of these antagonisms, Sunni regimes eventually - they believe they need their own Hezbollah to fight in their corner?
They reach this conclusion, they will not need to look far, because the combatants of this type have already attended a training - taught by Al Qaeda.
Why Europe can no longer ignore the Georgia.
The era where Europe could rely on America to wage war, restore peace and democracy in its own backyard is over.
With the enlargement of the European Union, and as demonstrated by the recent Russian gas crisis, this Court now includes not only the Ukraine but also the Georgia.
Indeed, in Georgia, as in Ukraine, democracy is put to the test and Europe cannot afford to ignore it.
The Georgia was the first country in the post - Soviet space to operate its 'color revolution' and thus to demonstrate, with dignity and maturity, the choice of his people for democracy and European values.
The flags of the European Union that float on all Georgian public buildings since then show the attachment natural, as old as the history of this country which, for the ancient Greeks, was an integral part of the world at that time.
Prometheus, Medea, the Amazons and in the Armenia nearby Noah's Ark, are all signs that the Europe of our myths starts here.
By its history, its civilization, its traditions, old but also more recent, when the Georgia differed from the other republics of the former USSR, critical, independent spirit and even rebellious, the Georgia is probably today even the place of this space where the democratic transplant can take at best.
It is therefore all the more worrying to see the democratization of the country threatened.
Everything seemed to have started well enough.
With the launch without a shot being fired of a policy of reforms, privatization, fight against corruption, the new executive search and therefore free from compromises with the previous regime, the implementation of a foreign policy marked by a return of Europe in the Georgia game.
The totalitarian mindset has since resurfaced among these leaders who, proclaiming themselves the representatives of the majority, have taken still more powers.
This is a caste that such the thousand-headed Hydra ends not to die and be reborn from its ashes.
Those - here and their methods of power that the 'rose Revolution' November 2003 wanted once and for all remove themselves are reintroduced to the heart of power, using their networks, with ramifications including outside the borders, their considerable financial weight, their ability to intrigue and manipulation of political and electoral apparatus.
It is a power that does not sufficiently respect the essence of democracy which is not in the polls but in the separation and balance of powers.
Every day, the Government blends legislative, the vast majority of the laws is written in the Presidential Chancellery; the Parliament wants to control the daily exercise of Government policy, including, in my case, the appointment of ambassadors and their daily operation!
Finally, and this is the most serious, the judiciary can't always escape the supervision of the Executive and represents more or not yet for the citizen or the investor guarantor and protector, without which there is no rule of law, and economic freedom.
It is a society to be democratic in its head, is not yet in his legs. She still hesitates to engage in politics thus leaving the scene to those who occupy it for too long.
Because this democracy is in danger of switch, but because it is still there, strongly implanted in the population, in organizations of civil society, in a press which seeks but which does not lose its critical...
This is the time for Europe to save democracy in order to not to annihilate all those hopes.
States - United have already done what they could, since independence, and they are alongside the Georgian stability.
Stability was certainly not identified with democracy under the reign of Ãdouard ChevardnadzÃ©, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Soviet that the rose Revolution was dismissed from his post of president of Georgia.
But the Americans have invested generously in the survival of the Georgian elite and their learning of democracy.
Soros initiatives, today fashion criticism, seems to me to more unjustified: the November Revolution was not created from scratch by the Americans, no offense to the propaganda of the Russian nationalists too accustomed to direct interventions to be able to think differently, but democratic substrate which permitted certainly was nurtured, encouraged and supported by the aid of the Soros Foundation.
The Cape which must be crossed today that the Georgia evacuates its body - this time permanently - the badly totalitarian is a complex step that calls a support of a different nature, that Europeans are more able to provide.
The models that should be proposed for the balance of powers, the rule of law institutions, the functioning of the judiciary or local democracy must draw closer to reality European forms Georgian as the anglo - saxon model, variant American.
If Europe rejects this task, it would betray its fundamental duty to this country, small, Mediterranean, flexible, long historical tradition, where democracy has much better chance of success than in Ukraine, which is both very large and still very Soviet in his mind, not to mention Central Asia.
Not helping the Georgia, is to accept that democracy and stability are long to come not only in Tbilisi but in Kiev, more Minsk, to say nothing of Moscow.
It is especially to take a very serious risk.
Moscow which, with highs and lows, endless procrastination, internal tearing, began to resign themselves to the idea of the inevitability of democratic, at least at its periphery, not without renouncing its imperial dreams and their instruments of domination, could suddenly revise its perception.
This hesitant resignation, acceptance of a normality in its relations with its neighbours, which was in its infancy, can be swept away by a sudden eruption of irrationality of the power Russian of this famous "Derjava" who can't resist the lure of the weakness, the feeling of emptiness, the temptation to again be not equal, but the strongest.
This explains the recent Russian gas crisis.
Signs of decline of democracy, slowing the democratic wave, will be taken by Moscow as a mad hope reversibility where gradually the Russia is accoutumaient no longer believe.
It is the responsibility of Europe to convince Russia that it places to twist his hope in a return to the past.
Europe has this responsibility for it - even, to its future energy independence. It also has the responsibility to demonstrate that there are also strong European values â freedom, democracy, justice among peoples.
Why Europe must develop its policy instruments: a large public Foundation private for Europe and democracy, a University to train executives of tomorrow from democracies, seeking a police, an army of judges and magistrates who live near models of companies we want to convert.
Europe above all needs conviction.
If Europe agreed is not it - same she is interested in the fate of its neighbours, their democracy and the future of its values and their spread, which therefore believe in it tomorrow?
Berlusconi at Bay.
Silvio Berlusconi, who will become president of the European Union on July 1, is a clairvoyant man who once loved risk and whose business bets proved profitable. In the 1960s, he was the first to see that Milan, then a traditional Italian city where people walked to work, would become a modern metropolis, surrounded by American-style suburbs.
He then built his fortune in the real estate expansion.
Fifteen years later, Mr. Berlusconi realized that the monopoly held by the Italian State on television would not survive and he then set up what would become the first Italy private media group.
But nothing could perform both in the television than in real estate if he had not had adequate political relations.
In both cases, Berlusconi has prevailed over competitors taking advantage for the Socialists, at the time the rising stars of Italian political life.
His long association with Bettino Craxi, Milan the most influential politician in the 1970s and the Prime Minister of Italy in a large part of the 1980s was born very early.
On the other hand, political relations are not enough to become a politician.
Indeed, pass the trade policy was certainly not part of the wishes of Berlusconi.
His media group, weakened by excessive diversification (the decision to enter the retail distribution market had virtually destroyed), had difficulties in the 1990s.
Almost at the same time, former Prime Minister Craxi fled to Tunisia, pursued by the Italian courts a corruption mani pulite investigation conducted in the extensive network known as Tangentopoli (Bribesville).
Escape and exile of Craxi created a sense of loss among Berlusconi removing solid political support he needed.
He decided to become his own political sponsor.
As has often been the case in Italian history, the decision by Berlusconi to form a new political party (Forza Italia) a few months before the parliamentary elections of 1994 has proved to be charged.
The lack of experience of Berlusconi in politics led to the fall of his first Government six months after.
Any other man as rich as Berlusconi would have probably abandoned.
But he persisted and led the opposition for six years.
In 2001, his determination was rewarded with a victory resounding and, more importantly, by a term apparently destined to change.
Once more, Berlusconi probably had no choice: at the end of the 1990s, his association with the Socialists in disgrace was pursuing him both politically than legally.
His only hope to repel the magistrates was to control the Parliament and introduce new laws to halt the series of trials for corruption that him, a strategy that allows him to escape from prosecution until his term expires.
Unfortunately, while the Government of Berlusconi is invariably never short of speech, legal provisions put in place to suspend his trial include some laws that have been taken during its two years in power.
The achievements of Berlusconi Government combine good intuition (for example, attempting to reform Italian pensions in 1994) and insufficient implementation (mainly due to lack of courage, as surprising as it seems).
In 1994, during his first mandate, he realized very early that the Italy should overhaul its pension system and he therefore introduced bold legislation.
But a single general strike proved sufficient to kill his reformist zeal.
Lately, he has bravely taken advantage for States - United in the war in Iraq, against the majority of the country and his own coalition policy.
But it appeared soon after this frightened by his own courage and it became an almost invisible ally.
Despite his rhetoric, Berlusconi was not present (or has not been invited) to the Summit with president Bush in the Azores, where the final decision to go to war was taken.
With respect to social reforms, he fought the unions, without however to deliver the good fight: the infamous "Article 18" of Italy, which permits the courts work to restore an employee in his work if a judge believes he was dismissed unfairly.
But while Article 18 is important in principle, it is almost irrelevant in practice.
He served only to provoke a confrontation with the unions and to divert the Government of much greater social reforms.
Unlike what has happened in 1994, the current Berlusconi Government survives, but those hoping a revolution in favour of the free market will be disappointed.
No significant tax reduction has not been passed and reform on pensions is still waiting.
The powerful Minister of Finance of Berlusconi, Giulio Tremonti, speaks often and naively the need to renew the Government intervention in the economy; no action is taken to prevent strikes in the public transport sector.
Voters moderated of right, which wanted an Italian version (that is, somewhat watered-down) of the era Reagan / Thatcher, are disillusioned.
Berlusconi tries to hide inactivity frightening his voters, repeating again and again that the election of the moderate left would be tantamount to signing a pact with the Devil (that is, the Communists).
The Italians seem smarter, as clearly demonstrated by the result of the administrative elections in June.
Why the courageous visionary of the 1960s and 1970s he lost its shine?
This is explained partly by the fact that we are no longer in this context: Berlusconi is 40 years old and for the last ten years, he lived in the world of Roman politics.
He has learned the art of political (and personal) survival, but it has lost its vision and its taste for risk.
The gap technology European americano.
In the second half of the 1990s, the average annual growth rate of productivity in Europe amounted to 0.7% while States - United had 1.4%.
However, if we establish a distinction between industries that produce technologies information and communication (technologies ICT) and those who merely use these technologies, it appears that the productivity growth gap resulted almost entirely from the weakness of the European ICT sector.
The annual productivity growth in sectors that use ICT technologies averaged 0.63% to States - totaled United between 1995 and 2000 compared to 0.41% in Europe.
This situation confirms a well-known fact: Europe is less efficient that States - United to conduct research leading to innovations either because Europe allocates fewer resources to research, or because the resources available are used less efficiently, or both.
It is certain that the total expenditure on research and development are lower in Europe to the States - United, but not much.
In the 1990s, States - United spent annually 2.8% of their GNP to research and development, compared to 2.3% for Germany, 2% in the UK and 1.9% in France.
European Governments continue as to their habit of complaining about the lack of fiscal resources to support research and development (an argument far-fetched given the tiny share of expenditure allocated to research in oversized European budgets) and, whenever the European Commission so authorizes, they subsidize innovative firms or those that, they are more likely to invest in research and development.
The France and Italy, for example, demanded that the limits imposed on the budget deficits of eurozone members by the stability and Growth Pact exclude public expenditure allocated to research.
Similarly, the french government decided out Alstom, a company having developed several high-tech products, including the TGV, french, business high-speed train until it is bankrupt.
But it is highly unlikely that these two tactics to develop the European high-tech sector.
Why?
Because the weakness in research is not, at least not primarily a problem of funding.
The grants will create no effective high-tech companies.
Consider first the question of research.
Europe is lagging behind the States - United in each field: the number of patents, the number of Nobel Prize, the number of researchers in other countries it can attract.
But funding is only the visible part of the problem.
A euro spent on research in Europe is less productive than a dollar spent in the States - United in this goal, and this for two reasons: the motivations and the application of technology.
We fear that additional expenditure not followed by a change in the archaic University rules serve only to produce more wastes and not more discoveries.
They would that increase the power, prestige and resources of unwavering pressure groups composed of established University professors who often access and competition within their University.
The application of technology also plays an important role.
It allows to focus research, establishes time limits, examines the results of research and to evaluate patents according to the market prices.
Without motivation made by beneficiaries of these search results, the risk of drift, often without management research says.
It must be recognized that this situation does not apply to all areas: the study of ancient Greek fragments is valuable even if it rarely meets a demand.
But it is important in fields, both theoretical and practical, that could serve as a basis for the production of new technologies: Physics, biology, chemistry, technical, etc.
But defense spending that constitute the main engine of the search request.
Most of the technological advances of the period after - war (micro - chips to the Internet until new batteries for cell phones developed for the US Army in Iraq) have had, at least initially, a military application.
Cell phones, satellite tracking and cameras high resolution are expensive, but fortunately for the industries that use them, their development costs were partly supported by the Government.
One of the main reasons for the superiority of the States - United research is explained by the importance and the composition of defence spending.
The Pentagon budget is not only important: it represents more than half of all U.S. government research and development spending; in France, defence spending are only a quarter of total spending.
In 1999, U.S. spending on defence-related research and development reached 0.45 per cent of GNP, head of the UK and the France that reached only half of this figure, with 0.26 percent and 0.22 percent, respectively.
As suggested by the case of Alstom, the French have a different model in mind.
Rather than support the research and development with high defense budgets, they prefer to do so directly by subsidizing French high-tech companies.
The official rationale indicates that national defence budgets are too little high to create the necessary application to support research and development in high-technology sectors, while there is still no European budget for defence.
This is not a simple coincidence: if it is attributed in a spirit of competition, such a supranational budget would identify the winners and losers.
But many European countries still refuse to accept that some of their high-tech companies might not be the height: they think it is better to preserve these companies thanks to generous subsidies and avoid between - time consolidation of the European defence budgets.
By integrating its defense spending and increasing their importance, Europe would do a stone two strokes.
It would be more credible when it demands to be heard at international negotiation tables, particularly vis - Ã  - vis States - United, and it would stimulate scientific research.
To achieve this, it does not maintain the largest deficits, which simply involve higher taxes, but reducing spending in other areas of the budget.
In other words: a sacrifice in the short term for a gain in the long term.
Debt to the United States.
After almost fifteen years of unprecedented growth - with only a brief slowdown in 2000 / 2001 - States - United have become considerably indebted abroad, up to 25% of GDP.
With a deficit of current account which now exceeds 5% of the GDP, the external debt of the States - United is increasing rapidly.
Yet, no country can incur debts indefinitely, and this situation must therefore end sooner or later.
In early 1985, when the States current account deficit - United had reached $ 120 billion - or the equivalent of one-third of the current deficit - the rest of the world had ceased to fund.
The dollar was was then abruptly devalued, 50% compared with the Deutsche mark.
Europe has no interest to renew this experience.
In reality, the world has no means of a - sudden - death of the deficit of the current account of the States - United.
Without exports to States - United, the timid growth Europe has experienced over the past year to Faroes.
The process is can - be already started: the recovery of the euro - from $ 1.20 to $ 1.30 in the last months - was enough to cripple European growth at the end of this year.
Before the decline of the dollar, the 25 Member States of the EU exports increased by 6.5% per year, compared with 2% for consumption and 3% for investments.
In Japan, the recent recovery was almost entirely export-driven.
But the yen takes the value and growth here also seems to stop.
While central banks around the world are filled with dollars and trade imbalances become concern, there are three possible solutions.
Firstly, an increase in public savings to States - United.
It is unlikely, at least in the near future, given the ambitious projects of President Bush in tax matters and the continuation of the war in Iraq.
Private American savings is also slightly negative, and an increase could lead to a downturn in the short term.
Secondly, a devaluation more pronounced dollar, well above its current value against the euro and the yen.
A revaluation of the Chinese yuan would also be a good thing.
Thirdly, a resumption of growth in Europe, which would cause an increase of the exports from States - United.
It would require European companies to reduce their costs and increase their productivity.
As always in these cases - it promises a range of 'structural reforms', but none is likely to be implemented soon.
So, what to do?
One possibility would be to increase the working time without proportional increase in the hourly wage.
In the early 1970s, we worked the same number of hours on both sides of the Atlantic.
Today, in France and Germany, working on average 50% less than in the States - United.
This is explained in part by a European tax system more high, and on this plan anything is possible: it cannot be forced to work a person who considers that his salary after taxes is not worth.
But the relative decline of working time is also due to the success of the unions, who have obtained the compulsory leave.
A reform in this area, for an extension of the working time, would not reduce the total income of the employees, but would reduce production costs.
This idea began to be discussed in the press and hope - the behind the scenes among politicians and Union leaders.
In the meantime, rest of the world has an interest in what States - United retain a the current account deficit without precedent, at the cost of 500 billion dollars per year.
This allows the Chinese to maintain the stability of their currency against the dollar, remain extremely competitive, and gradually take 200 million workers from agriculture to industry, the aim of the authorities for the next decade.
In Europe, the US external deficit has the only source of growth.
But this may not last.
One day where the other, Europe must stop thinking that United States - can save its economy, and must rely on its own resources.
But that it is not surprising if the - United States and the devaluation of the dollar are accused of the next downturn in the European economy.
A scapegoat is always useful.
Abba Eban: The voice of Israel.
For nearly two generations, Abba Eban represented the voice of Israel acting as his Messenger to the Conservatives and the powerful nations and the Jewish people around the world.
Since his first appearance alongside Dr. Chaim Weizmann in the late 1940 during the struggle for independence and Jewish sovereignty, only an extremely small number of people has expressed as clearly the case of Zionist and Jewish with as much eloquence and conviction.
With his Churchillian prose and his Shakespearean cadences, his mellifluous phrases and his bombastic voice passed for decades the message of hope to a people who could have lost all hope and confidence in humanity after the horrors of the second world war.
As Ambassador from the States - United and the United Nations, then as Minister for foreign foreign, he represented an Israel which the Liberal imagination around the world could identify.
Larger and more powerful nations envied a spokesperson - so powerful and his speech became the classic examples for statesmen and diplomats from distant countries.
His books, he found time to write despite the requirements eventful of diplomacy, were the unique combination of enormous erudition and comprehensibility of the clarity of the Crystal.
His academic training and his gifts to the rhetoric complement one another to form a single body.
Rarely a small country was represented by a statesman of this magnitude: only Thomas Masaryk and Jan Smuts can support comparison.
It was a true patriot, in the old sense of the term: proud of its people without however being ethnocentric, man of the world but deeply rooted in the Jewish cultural heritage, centred on the plight and the tribulations of the Jewish people but without ever losing the universal horizon of mankind.
In a Word, it was a modern Jew in the best sense of the term.
It has often been claimed that the Prime Minister Levi Eshkol spoke seven languages, all in yiddish.
Of Eban, it could be said that he spoke ten and all with an accent of Oxford / Cambridge.
However, what appealed to the outside world was not always a benefit to the heart of the harshness and the collapse of the Israeli policy.
Eban was probably too refined, too academic and too man of the world towards the hoist, as so well expressed by Disraeli, to the top of the greasy pole.
Accompanied by Golda Meir and Moshe Dayan, he had to leave the Government in 1974 after the Yom Kippur war.
He could hardly be held responsible for the hubris that triggered the avalanche of 1973, but these events however led to his downfall.
He was never able to return to power and when he was confronted with the new policy of the primaries and populism, he felt shot because he could not stand this new style.
In the international arena, the pen of Eban it was a sword and the floor was his spear.
He was less adroit in political infighting in Israel.
He could be a fighter hard on the turf, but however, it is fairer to say that he could fight more hard to defend his moderate beliefs and dovish in the Government post - 1967 in which he participated.
It is not clear if he would have won due to its lack of independent political base, but its prestige and reputation internationally could leave him a chance if he had chosen to pick up the glove.
It has never done so.
The silence of Eban in recent years was not only aroused by his disillusionment towards Israeli policy or his declining health.
In a period where the public debate in Israel are torn between fanatics nationalists pseudo - religious and anti - Zionist masquerading as the post - modernist, moral certitudes of Eban, impregnated of savoir - vivre, may seem superficial.
But for a country, it is essential to have a certain moral force and Eban provided it in abundance to his people and to the world.
Although several years since I have spoken to Eban has elapsed, I have not doubted one second that it would have been extremely sad to see the turn that took the events after the failure of the Camp David and Taba negotiations in 2000-2001 and the conduct of the Israeli policy would seem to him a bad omen.
However, in all probability, it would have was even more disappointed by the inability Palestinians to conclude an agreement on the existence of the Jewish State.
As a pro - Arabic because of his training, bathing in the Arab and Muslim culture, he still hoped that the glorious Arab past could be rejuvenated, that a culture Arab and Muslim tolerance could triumph over fanaticism and extremism.
Such was the basis of his hope of reconciliation between Jews and Arabs.
This Arab renaissance, to use the expression of the great Palestinian scholar George Antonius, has not seen the day could have been the biggest disappointment of Eban.
Despite the image of man in the world that Eban gave, it was extremely vulnerable: that to some would sometimes call traits of pride could take its source from humble origins.
While speaking in very good English, Eban was not born in a castle: it had a fringe of anglo - Jews.
He was, in the true sense of the term, a "self - made man", whose courage, ambition, dynamism and a deep faith in her destiny led to the Summit.
His spirit sailed in the upper echelons.
In this Abba Eban was a true representative of the people he represented so gloriously.
A practical guide on the Israeli hawks.
The announcement of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon indicating willingness to dismantle the Jewish settlements of the Gaza Strip and some West Bank settlements has shocked and caught off guard the Israeli nation and the nations of the world.
Many denounced Sharon's plan as being a trick.
But this surprise was crazy from the beginning.
Despite the appearance that they give to foreigners, the debate in Israel about the future of the occupied territories were never reduced to a simple story of hawks and doves.
Like any thing in Israel, the process is more complex, and particularly where the hawks are concerned.
Overall, there are two species of Israeli Hawks: the ideological and the strategic.
Ideological hawks consider the occupied territories as part of the historical land of Israel, the homeland of the Jewish people.
For them, the territories are of Jewish heritage, which explains their insistence on calling the West Bank by its Hebrew historical appellation: Judea and Samaria.
Ideological hawks are not all religious, although those who are based their claim on promises and the divine prophecies.
But many ideological hawks are secular nationalists and their jargon is similar to that of the nationalists types of Eastern and Central Europe.
Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir belonged to this category.
Ideological hawks usually belong to the National religious party and Likud.
They are inspired by a nationalist ideology associated with Vladimir Jabotinsky, who founded "revisionist" Zionism in order to challenge the more moderate version adopted by the founding fathers of Israel, including Chaim Weizmann and David Ben - Gurion.
Next strategic hawks.
For them, given the geographic form close and vulnerable Israel and the continuing hostility of Arabs, control of the West Bank and Gaza is not an ideological imperative, but responds to security considerations.
For them, the Jewish settlements in the territories do not constitute a return to historical lands, but represent bastions of security designed to prevent (or repel from a more strategic location) an attack in the heart of Israel.
This assessment of the situation may be right or wrong, but it is certainly not ideological.
Ariel Sharon, who comes from a medium military (he grew up in a social milieu whose ideas were more akin to the labour party than to Jabotinsky), is a strategic Hawk.
For ideological hawks, compromises are treason: how to put at risk the heritage of the Jewish people, not to mention the promise of God to Abraham?
Strategic hawks are however open to negotiations and practical compromise, if the circumstances and security considerations justify it in their eyes.
It is in this context that must be considered the measures taken by Sharon.
He was elected on the promise that he would bring peace and security.
He brought neither the one nor the other.
With the defeat and the demise of Saddam Hussein, the danger of an "Eastern front" against Israel has weakened.
Without a Palestinian partner, and due to continued Palestinian terrorism that the desperate actions of Israel fail to suppress, the measures taken by Sharon arise from this reflection oriented strategy: erect an effective barrier, move some of the colonies isolated and strategically untenable, and wait.
Sharon statements during the previous year seem to follow a well-defined pattern.
First, he admitted that"one day or the other", a Palestinian State would make his appearance, an inconceivable idea for pure ideological hawks.
A few months later, he scandalized his followers the Conference of party Likud by declaring that the occupation was unacceptable and untenable, another shock for those who had always talked about "liberated" rather than "occupied" territories.
Last December, he explicitly stated that Israel was facing a stop - the - unilateral fire that would inevitably result in the "relocation" of some settlements.
Although that these statements not akin once again that to a simple verbiage, they did in no less constitute a new language for a Likud Prime Minister.
The latest statements by Sharon yet explicitly appointed the settlements to be evacuated; the Director of the national Security Council, general Giora Eiland, was appointed president of an interdepartmental Committee of relocation to elaborate plans to evacuate settlements and provide compensation for relocated settlers.
All this has radically altered the domestic political map of Israel.
Some ideological hawks in Sharon's Government have threatened to resign; Shimon Peres announced that the Labour Party would offer Sharon a parliamentary safety net; There is also talk that the labour party to join a national unity Government.
The test is well obviously not planning, but the implementation of the withdrawal, and the road is long and bumpy.
The timing by Sharon may have been guided by the problems it encounters following police investigations into his alleged corruption.
However, anyone would predict the future behaviour of Sharon must keep in mind that in contrast to Begin and Shamir, Sharon has a military past and that for him, security, and not ideology, is paramount.
Thus, his apparent pragmatism should not surprise.
Iraq: The justice of the victors.
Saddam Hussein is dead, but all Iraqis did not welcome.
Instead, the way in which the different ethnic and religious groups have responded to his execution is emblematic of the difficulty to maintain the cohesion of the Iraq.
For the Shiite majority, long violently oppressed by Saddam Hussein and all previous Iraqi regimes of Sunni, Saddam death symbolizes their conquest of political hegemony.
Moreover, their triumphalist liesse manifestations are a cruel reminder of the way in which the oppressed, once released, can so easily become the oppressors in turn.
For the minority Sunni, discounted power invasion American and speaks of his frustration with daily attacks against the Shiite population and its holy sites, Saddam will remain a hero for a long time.
The Kurds - who as the Shiites, have suffered the exactions of Saddam for decades - cling quietly to their de facto independence, while doing what it takes to make sure that they will never be subject to an Arab regime.
The Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri al - Maliki, who represents the Shiite and Kurdish coalition to power, has expressed his hope that the execution of the dictator will overcome sectarian divisions.
But even if his words seem sincere, reality leads to the opposite direction, and abusive verbal exchanges at run time even will certainly not help to forget that he was the justice of the victors - not States - United, but some Shiites.
These events do not bode well for the future of what we should get used to appoint "l'ex - Iraq".
Indeed, the current debate in Washington on the Iraq stabilization is moved because we cannot stabilize something that exists in this case more - precise, the Iraq as a sovereign State.
Under the guise of inspired constitutional amendments share the United States, the Shiite majority has succeeded in arrogating near-absolute power.
It is as well as what appeared to be to Washington, a few months ago a successful transition to a representative Government is no more than a farce: as under Saddam, the authority depends on the control of weapons. The difference is that today ' today the Government no longer has the monopoly of violence.
Each militia, every department, every Shiite political faction has its own weapons, his thugs and death squads. For their part, Sunnis continue to use weapons stockpiles accumulated under Saddam to fighting a rear - guard against the new order, apparently legitimized by elections.
With the exception of a new violent dictatorship, no authority is able to bring together Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds into a single political entity.
The pipe dream of the American administration - democratizing overnight a deeply divided society accustomed to violence and coercion - released a terrifying procession of political demons.
In these circumstances, the debate to the Baker report - Hamilton in Washington had little impact on the future of the Iraq, although it remains essential to the future of the power, the prestige and status of the States â United in the world.
The future of the Iraq will be decided by the Iraqis, but by bullets and not ballots.
The - United States and the entire international community are totally imprepares to face the Middle - Eastern version of Yugoslavia and its regional consequences.
And unlike the successor States of the breakup of Yugoslavia, which could draw inspiration from Europe, the absence of a democratic model Arab legitimate makes it more difficult even the establishment of a democratic order.
Some Europeans and others may gloat over the failure of the - United States in Iraq, and of ineptitude - or worse - their desperate policy following the occupation.
And yet the deep-seated reasons for this failure date back well more far away, to the creation of all parts of Iraq in the 1920s by the imperialist authorities British, which gathered together three disparate provinces of the ottoman Empire defeated in a State that never had a coherent identity.
So the Foundation even the Iraq is based on justice winners: the British Empire after defeating the Ottomans gave the power to the Sunni Arabs in a country where they were a minority.
Today, this arrangement is unraveling as a result of a new round of Victor's justice.
The consequences of this reorganization of power are not yet obvious.
But it is certain that Iraqi consistent state, that it is unified, federal or confederal, cannot emerge from a company which part rightly regards Saddam Hussein as a bloodthirsty dictator and another part reveres it as hero and martyr.
Wars always have unintended consequences and the cruel ironies.
In Iraq, it becomes now apparent that some States cannot be saved without be destroyed.
The battle of the European Union for the Turkey.
When the conspirators behind the Istanbul suicide attacks launched their human bombs against synagogues and British office buildings, they had different audiences in mind.
The citizens of the European Union that the Turkish political class is eager to join as soon as possible represents one of these audiences, possibly the most important.
The battle within the EU about the entry of the Turkey will be held on many fronts: in the country itself, where the Government is currently undertaking major reforms to qualify to enter the European Union, to the negotiating table as soon as the European Council of December 2004 allows the Commission to open formal negotiations for accession to the European Union and among the public in the countries already members.
Of these three fronts, the last is the most demanding.
Most of the citizens of the European Union are uneasy today to the idea of the Turkey to enter the Union.
Those responsible for the atrocities of Istanbul have can - be calculated that Islamist terrorism could grow this malaise.
By tradition, Europeans have always accepted new members hurrying to the front door to join the club as he was in the Group of six countries of origin in the 25 countries that he will bring the European Union in 2004.
Once purely Western community, the Union pushed its boundaries in all directions.
Starting next year, it will stretch North of Finland to Cyprus and Malta in the South of the Ireland in the West to the Baltic States East.
While the peoples that make up often feared that the newcomers take their jobs and subsidies, they have always come to accept.
But the case of the Turkey is different.
The 10 new countries entering the Union next year, and even the Balkan countries which now are offered the possibility of future membership, are all within a traditional definition of Europe.
None of them is size to worry the current balance of the EU.
None of this applies in the case of the Turkey.
Except for a narrow strip of land, its territory belongs to Asia, not Europe, its culture is Islamic and not a Christian, and if it were to join the union in 2013 for example, its population will be by far the largest and youngest of all EU member countries.
In addition, because of the Turkish borders with countries such as that the Iran and the Iraq-Syria, the Turkey would bring to European Union neighborhood disturbing: a region of the world incapable of developing a regional peace on its own, a front - post of fundamentalism and Islamic terrorism, an assemblage of fragile States imbued of nationalism, a field of confrontation for the militarizationeven nuclear, a region where States - United remain involved strategically and where Israel will always be the point of concentration of feelings anti - Westerners.
The Turkey entering the Union, the EU will become part of a Middle East expanded restless and disturbing, the most provocative part of the world today.
And yet, it is precisely because of these implications that exceed the advantages posed by the arrival of the Turkey in the EU and by far the risks that it represents.
Above all, the possibility of a future accession to the Union is the most powerful force for the modernisation of the Turkey, and a modern, democratic and prosperous Turkey is vital to Europe, be it inside or outside the Union.
In addition, to enter the EU a type moderate islam as that present in Turkey will be of crucial importance for the integration of Muslim minorities in European countries, already significant and growing even without the input of the Turkey population.
Finally, with the possibilities that brings the Turkey with its Islamic traditions, regional contacts, resources and geography, the EU will be in a better position to exert a stabilizing influence on a region that will inevitably affect Europe's security.
These are strong arguments.
The big question remains whether they are powerful enough to influence the skeptical European public.
It would only take one single country on 30 members that the EU will represent may be in 2013 to prevent the accession of the Turkey.
Some countries, without doubt, will want to give a voice to the people through a referendum that will leave the decision to the people, not only in Parliament.
Even in Germany, where the constitution does not allow referendums, known in the referendum in the case of the entry of the Turkey and an opposition party has already announced that he would be a central issue of the election campaign of the year next to the elections to the European Parliament.
Once public unease towards the Turkey may find a point of focus on the referendum for the country's eventual entry into the EU, there is little chance that he could enter.
At the end of the negotiations, it will appear may be that the Turkey is ready for Europe but that Europe is not yet ready for the Turkey.
This is why the battle for the entrance of the Turkey has already started and that terrorists from Istanbul seem to have well understood.
Those who believe that the EU will be beneficial for the Turkey just as much as for Europe must also engage in the battle to defend their ideas.
There would be nothing worse, for the Turkey and Europe, that European Governments ready to welcome the Turkey and failing to convince their populations.
The terrorists will continue no doubt stoke the fears of the timid European against an Islamist Turkey.
Hope that in the end, attacks against the innocent people of the streets congested Istanbul do not feed the fears of Europeans but rather a sense of solidarity with this dynamic and moderate, countries face a common enemy.
High fences make bad neighbors in Europe.
Good fences make good neighbors, as the poet Robert Frost wrote.
Unfortunately, the European Union seems to take the poetic imagination of Frost as a political order important.
Indeed, how the European Union is it preparing to welcome the citizens of the ten countries that will join the in may?
Everything just slamming the door in the face and by installing protection laws forcing them to stay outside first and foremost.
In fact, the Union is even worse.
Since there is no agreement at European level on the regulations to apply to the new citizens of the Union, each member country establishes its own regulations without coordination.
Some of these regulations being created are draconian.
The Austria and Germany - so far the two largest recipients of immigration from Europe of the is, by hosting the four fifth - announced last year that they were going to restrict immigration from the new Member States for the duration of the transition period, seven years.
The France and the Belgium will restrict immigration of new citizens of the European Union during the first two years of the period of transition at least.
The Sweden seemed to have adopted a liberal position initially, but now postponed the opening of its borders and could reduce the access of immigrants to social aid.
The Danish Government almost collapsed in January when the Ministry of labour proposed opening the labour market to all new EU citizens who can prove that they have found a job.
The Greece and the Italy kept silent so far, which probably means that they will retain the current restrictions vis - Ã  - vis the new Member States: they will be de facto treated in the same way that all immigrant outside the EU.
Thus, all countries bordering the new Member States will be closed to migration from 'New Europe'.
All these dams reflect the growing general concern to the citizens of the new Member States emigrating to take advantage of the generous EU welfare systems.
No wonder, then, that the most spectacular falls from popular support for enlargement registered by the European polls occurred in the countries of the EU benefiting social assistance services the most generous.
But the support for enlargement weakens everywhere, on the threshold of the entry of the new countries.
At the same time, close the door of the Union on its newest citizens will not solve the problem of access to social services and will certainly harm economic growth.
On employment of the European Union markets that are characterized by their low mobility, such as those that exist in Western Europe or southern Europe, migrants can play a very important role.
By increasing average productivity, they contribute not only to strengthen growth, but also to achieve higher per capita incomes.
In fact, because of the distortions in the definition of wages - often set without actual correspondence with local labor productivity rates - migrant workers contribute even to reduce the rate of unemployment in Western and southern Europe.
Furthermore, close the door will not solve the issue of access to social aid since illegal immigration poses a threat worse than legal immigration: it exploits the available resources without contributing anything in return for welfare benefits even if the majority of immigrants are young and work.
The best way to treat the fear of immigration as a source of abuse to social systems would be to adopt common and rather generous transitional quota at the level of the Union European whole, then remove them quickly if they are not filled.
Migration quotas are preferable to any other kind of restriction because they allow that at least part of the potential profits for social assistance from immigration is made.
Quotas could be determined depending on the historical period of high immigration - according to, for example, an annual flow of 400,000 people for the whole of the European Union.
While these transitional restrictions are put in place, reforms should be undertaken to answer the questions that sous - tend the fears of the public deal with immigration.
The root of this fear, of course, lies in vast income differences that exist between the citizens of the Lithuania, for example, and those of most of the countries of the Union.
Of course, economic convergence is a long-term affair.
Thus, policies of redistribution of the EU should be reformed to discourage citizens of poorer countries to go shopping to social assistance.
Here the problem is the incompatibility of social insurance on the one hand, where aid you receive are based on contributions made, and on the other hand, social assistance involving cash transfers programs.
All countries of the European Union as well as the new members should be encouraged to adapt their social assistance programs (which are also present in the new Member States), so that they all meet some basic requirements.
Coordination of these minimum income guaranteed across the European Union must gradually set up with the intention, in the long term, to establish a valid safety net throughout the Union European and forming one of its institutional pillars.
The challenges of CalderÃ³n.
The Mexico has finally found a new president last Friday, in circumstances of bad omen.
Felipe CalderÃ³n took oath, braving the wrath of his left-wing opposition, and thus showing more malignant as the Partido de la RevoluciÃ³n DemocrÃ¡tica (PRD) and its leader, AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador, but not to avoid paying the price strong.
Broadcasts television news and the front pages worldwide showed the same titles: "the new Mexican president came to power in the chaos and violence".
Mexico's institutions withstood narrowly attacks virtually insurrectional left opposition, which is bent in vain to prevent the inauguration of Calderon, and the bitterness of a Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI), becoming increasingly decided to allow CalderÃ³n to power, before failing miserably.
If CalderÃ³n impressively overcame seemingly insurmountable obstacles that littered the path to the Presidency, the struggle to govern and transform the Mexico is still just beginning.
Most Mexican journalists believe that it should be relatively easy for CalderÃ³n to do better than what was the failure largely self - inflicted from outgoing president Vicente Fox.
The Mexico needs a growth about two times faster than it was known as Fox (a small 2% per year).
If CalderÃ³n can strengthen the law and order and use his considerable political skills to reach an agreement with the PRI on structural economic reforms, he will succeed.
But this is simplistic.
The mandate of Fox, as well as the last four years of president Ernesto Zedillo, have not really been a failure.
The Mexico had not experienced economic stability, low inflation, low interest, stable currency rates and growing, although poor, ten years in a row since the 1960s.
For the first time, home loans, car loans and consumer credits have become accessible to the lowest layers of the middle class: this year, it built and sold more houses and bought more cars than ever before.
Similarly, although you can accuse Fox of failing to silence the protesters and an opposition extremist and disruptive, there has never been recourse to the bloody repression that made famous most of its predecessors.
In addition, he tore the Mexico to its archaic cocoon in terms of Foreign Affairs and placed immigration and human rights at the heart of the new Mexican international program.
CalderÃ³n is not that negotiate with the PRI is an easy task, and it is unable to develop a coalition Government, it considers to be the solution to the impasse in the Mexico ends up blocked since 1997.
What are the benefits of a cabinet consisting only of members of his Partido AcciÃ³n Nacional (PAN), this is not what CalderÃ³n sought.
Similarly, it has proved impossible to reach a any agreement with the opposition regarding the investiture ceremony, where also chaotic scenes that depressing of members of Congress by train to fight in the House, while CalderÃ³n passed quickly through a door from behind for a ceremony shipped in a hurry.
The economic problems of the Mexico could prove them as much more insoluble that seem to think many journalists.
The Mexico has experienced an economic sudden opening under former president Carlos Salinas in 1988-1994, of a political opening delayed but successful under president Zedillo in 1994-2000, and, finally, a true rotation of powers thanks to Fox.
But the foundations of the old PRI - corporatist created in the 1930s system remained intact and represent the greatest and most impressive barriers to growth and to the success of the Mexico.
The first pillar of this system consists of public and private economic monopolies that dominate the country.
Oil (Pemex) and electricity (ComisiÃ³n Federal de owned) State-run companies have no competition.
Private de facto monopolies of telecommunications (Telmex), television (Televisa), cement (Cemex), of bread and tortilla manufacturing (respectively Bimbo and Maseca) and the Bank (Banamex / Citigroup and Bancomer / Banco de Bilbao) must can - be compete abroad, but not at the national level.
These monopolies are stronger than ever, and they are price, supplies, service and quality who suffer.
The second pillar is formed by the unions that control the movement of Mexican workers since the 1930s.
They enjoy prerogatives hiring and dismissal of non - unionized workers, elect leaders by acclamation, benefit from compulsory contributions without transparency and a huge power policy.
The teachers Union is the largest in Latin America, the oil workers Union is the richest and employees of the social security thwarts any attempt to reform pensions or health for years.
The third pillar of the system is the political monopoly.
For 70 years, the PRI has completely controlled Mexican politics; Today there are three parties to do so, and no one else can enter the political arena or have access to huge public subsidies - more than 500 million dollars last year--without their consent.
The main parties are drafting their own legislation anti - trust, vote their own grants, and choose their own elected representatives.
The absence of one consecutive reelection at any level reinforces the power of the party machines: they are the choice of candidates, voters merely ratify at the polls.
The challenges of the Mexico therefore reduce free movement of workers, breaking the private monopolies and open up public monopolies to competition, and lower entry barriers restricting access to the political arena.
These are may not be sufficient conditions for success, but they are certainly needed.
CalderÃ³n must strengthen his presidency from the beginning.
Take possession of power is perhaps the only way to achieve this, even if it may seem risky.
Elected with only 35% of the votes, without a majority in Congress, and a seizure of power on the eve of an economic slowdown to States - United, things are difficult anyway.
Given that roughly a third of the electorate think that he won wrongly, and saw the precariousness of the rule of law in the country, the position of CalderÃ³n is even less enviable.
Prudence and patience are anyway probably not his best Councillors.
The challenge of Mr. ChÃ¡vez.
The recent legislative elections which were held in the Venezuela confirmed the trend which has placed the country in the headlines of all newspapers in recent years.
President Hugo ChÃ¡vez has demonstrated once more that it enjoys wide support among poor and desperate of the country population and it has a good measure of advance on his opposition in terms of political skills, skill and ruthlessness.
However, observed at the same time a decrease in attendance at the ballot box as each new election organized under the mandate of Mr. ChÃ¡vez and the dubious legality of elections is increasingly visible.
It is certain that the withdrawal of the opposition a few days of the election was rather, as proclaimed by Mr. ChÃ¡vez, a symptom of his own weaknesses rather than the problems of electoral process.
And it is almost sure that this same weakness is part of the gradual choking of certain aspects of the traditional Venezuelan democracy.
Even so, the errors of the opposition were very important, ranging from support for the coup d'etat failed against Mr. ChÃ¡vez, elected democratically, in April 2002 to attack without result against PEDEVSA, the national oil company of Venezuela, at the beginning of 2003.
Nothing is more dangerous in politics than failure in direct confrontations.
In such circumstances, Mr. ChÃ¡vez can afford to be bold, despite his political failures when it comes to act in favour of its electoral base: 50% or more of Venezuelans who live in poverty and despair.
Poverty has increased since Mr ChÃ¡vez came to power in 1998: the State budget and trade balances are even more at the mercy of oil revenues now that it only was the case in the past, and, aside from Cuban literacy programs and services of proximity of the "barefoot doctors", all of the health of the poor has stagnatednot to say worst.
It is likely that the future will bring no major changes.
Mr. ChÃ¡vez may modify much of the constitution to his liking and mass parachute his men in the judiciary and the electoral authorities.
It will continue to distribute grants thanks to oil revenues in the well time-tested tradition of the Marcos PÃ©rez JimÃ©nez and Carlos AndrÃ©s PÃ©rez.
Thus, Mr. ChÃ¡vez may get elected again next year and may well remain in power until the end of the next decade.
However, if that is what the Venezuelan people want, so be it.
It is, after all, their spring than to decide which govern them, and how, as long as human rights are not systematically violated or democratic institutions suspended indefinitely and that the international standards of business conduct are respected.
According to the latter, at least, Mr. ChÃ¡vez has may - have been further that it is permitted.
For years, he was accused of having taken over the mantle of Fidel Castro by supporting a radical rhetoric and anti - imperialist, not to say revolutionary, throughout Latin America.
It may be time now for the nations of Latin America and the international community to take these accusations seriously.
Mr. ChÃ¡vez distributes the oil nations of the Caribbean Islands and Cuba and redeems the argentine debt to support the policy of president Nestor Kirchner.
In Mar del Plata, Argentina, last month, he openly attended a rally against free - trade of the Americas (FTAA), in the company, among other things, of Evo Morales, the Bolivian leader of the growers of coca leaves, which may well become the next president of Bolivia.
Similarly, Mr. ChÃ¡vez openly supports Daniel Ortega, the Sandinista presidential candidate Lord, Nicaraguan and Shafick Handal another eternal candidate of the FMLN in the El Salvador.
His former Ambassador to Mexico participated openly vehemently to certain evenings of presidential electoral campaign, the Mayor of Mexico City, Mr. AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador.
It seems that Mr. ChÃ¡vez's foreign policy follows a main theme: the provocation of a major confrontation with the States - United.
The danger is, of course, at the moment where this confrontation will happen, if it happens, be it about the Bolivia of the FTAA, human rights or freedom of the press, it will be too late to control.
The challenge is therefore to prevent the confrontation that Mr. ChÃ¡vez clearly wants to provoke.
Unfortunately, the Government of George Bush never was very adept of the prevention of conflicts.
The other nations of the hemisphere have a vested interest in preventing a fight that would force to take advantage and could even threaten their national security and economic interests.
While many of the positions of Mr. ChÃ¡vez have received some support on the part of some nations from Latin America, the division that he created in Latin America, with the help of Cuba Castro, between the right and the left, between the defenders of free trade and the "bolivaristes" between the pro and anti - Americans, is essentially artificial but certainly not impossible to overcome.
Certainly, many leaders of Latin America have tried to soothe and control Mr. ChÃ¡vez, without result.
It could cost us very dearly no longer try.
The last time that revolutionaries opposed to the USA - in Central America, in the 1980s, everyone has lost.
New divisions in the hemisphere, created by a leader in oil revenues, would be much more catastrophic.
Should they reaffirm positive discrimination?
The equality before the law of all citizens is a fundamental principle of the liberal order.
Such rights offer the opportunity to participate in political life, to create associations and express themselves freely.
They open doors the door to economic participation and participation in social institutions such as education.
The constitutional guarantee of these rights represent a spectacular success in the long battle for citizenship who scored two centuries that come past.
However, such legal guarantees of these rights are often inadequate.
And even the right to vote has little meaning for someone who is totally dependent on other institutions and others.
Equality before the law remains an empty promise of meaning for those who can afford to use it or who simply do not know how to use it.
The civic right to education to the intellectual abilities of each measurement must be encouraged in many ways.
Thus, one of the main themes of social progress in the last century was to give life to the abstract concept of equality of rights through the creation of a social content.
This meant to actively encourage these actions by the information and political education, for example.
In regards to the world of education, this often meant committing resources on financial aid to students in the form of subsidised loans or scholarships destinations.
Yet, despite these achievements, certain stubborn obstacles still objected to the equal participation of all.
Of large groups of the population remained sous - represented in the social circles of distinguished citizens.
Was the case notably of women and cultural minorities, particularly in cases where these minorities were characteristics of allocation are not related to a choice such as the color of the skin.
Few leaders, Ministers, teachers, doctors or lawyers were found in populations of these groups, nourishing and questions about the invisible barriers that prevented these minorities access to such positions.
Proponents of the entrenched institutional cultures have can - be militated against women or blacks.
Want a full citizenship for all involved need to achieve more than what the legal guarantees, the dissemination of information and even financial aid offered.
It was a courageous step, conducted by States - United in mind, to decide for a time at least that new policies were needed to correct these injustices installed for a long time. Affirmative action, or the affirmative as it was called, was to put in place a set of rules that reserved a percentage of representation among political candidates, students and teachers, the police and the armed forces, and in any other group, for persons belonging to these disadvantaged minorities.
United States Supreme Court - Became the guardian of positive discrimination.
Everywhere where she was seriously implemented, positive discrimination was undoubtedly a success.
Is particularly the case in countries which formerly had a homogeneous population and must now take account of black or Muslim or identifiable as citizens belonging to an identifiable and neglected minority.
And, at the same time where other countries turned to the States - United to draw a political model that political discrimination was questioned through three essential questions.
First, does it not incurs the risk of inverted injustice by which the traditionally privileged classes are poor?
The Supreme Court of the States - United had to answer this question when TC treated for the first time in the case of a student white who was denied admission to medical school despite its academic results superior to those of other candidates.
In Great - Britain, the children in private school must now fear of ending up in a disadvantaged position because of pressures on universities to admit more students from State schools.
This brings back us to the time-tested and unpleasant question of whether we can be equal as well as excellent?
Then the equal at all levels representation is - it really that all are asking for and what we vons all need?
After all, the "feminization" of the metieurs of education in many countries had no negative effect.
Many countries have benefited from the spirit of entrepreneurship of their Jewish or Chinese minorities.
No money - the lack us not at too mechanical pursuit of ideals where the absence of privileges and obstacles are confused with of diversity?
Finally, positive discrimination in some cases no product - not a new form of rigid segmentation that destroys the true civil society it seeks to put in place?
Women, for example, are - they always the best lawyers for the defence of the interests of women?
The same question arises for members of religious groups and ethnic minorities, and even of certain social classes.
One shudders at the idea of parliaments where the main criterion for admission would be the belonging to a group in need of representation by affirmative action.
Indeed, in some countries, democracy is unable to implement imaginative and effective governance because the main objective seems to be to take into account all major groups.
To resume a developed ci - idea above, discrimination posititve has always been and is still one last courageous step in the fight for universal civil rights, not only on paper but in reality.
However, positive discrimination must not become a lasting principle of liberal order.
If there is a set of legal provisions that needs a "sunset clause" to implement the study's results produced after a period specific and limited application, it is positive discrimination.
The flexibility of the Supreme Court of the States - United in this field is exemplary.
Elsewhere, it is probably best to introduce local legislation a clause of expiration for positive discrimination after a period of five or ten years at the most.
Such a clause could be renewed but there is nothing more effective that a deadline closes to force a careful examination and the concentration of the reflections.
The State - nation revisited.
It is now fashionable to claim that the State - nation has lost his place.
Globalization, said - on, means that nations can no longer control their own affairs.
They must unite with others, as in the case of the European Union, ASEAN or Mercosur, and as always more with international institutions like the United Nations, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization.
This viewpoint is risky.
Moreover, when you look more closely, it turns out suspect, or simply false.
The State - nation, with its strengths and weaknesses, is alive and well and is doing wonderfully.
To begin with its strengths, the State - nation remains the only political space that succeeds in the constitution of liberty.
Democratic organizations such as EU references are questionable, and totally absent in the case of the United Nations and other global institutions.
In addition, despite searching attends new identities, European, Latin - American or other, and despite many references to a new cosmopolitanism, or even a "global civil society", most of the people feel at home in their own country, the State - nation of which they are citizens.
Migration is usually directed towards other countries.
Many countries are discussing the integration of migrants.
Be - it to be British, German or American?
Such debates on immigration have a meaning only if we recognize that citizenship is defined by and for the nations.
It is, for most people, the positive side of the State - nation.
The State - nation was for more than two centuries and continues to be the benchmark of belonging and civic involvement for most human beings human.
This is the context in which we see our freedoms protected or destroyed.
The countries freed from communism in 1989 surely felt that restoring national sovereignty and regain freedom were closely related.
There is yet, and there has always been something else, most detestable, of the State - nation: it is nationalism.
The nationalist impulse can be aggressive or defensive, directed against others or oriented towards the inside.
In both cases, it corrupts any attempt to create an international community of open societies.
That was the problem in Iraq: a State - nation had become a troublemaker in the region and to the - beyond.
More recently, a less violent but also worrying phenomenon has gained ground: the revival of national protectionism.
The Doha round of trade negotiations is stuck because developed countries are refusing to open their markets to cheaper products from developing countries, who in turn are trying to protect their infant industries.
Many would prefer privileged to open trade relations.
In this field, the EU has often been helpful.
But today, the nationalist virus has infected up to the European Union.
The France, the Spain and the Poland tried to hold their main industries in "national hands".
Suddenly, the single European market is forgotten, and a return to the fragmented markets takes root.
Consider, for example, the "guidelines on services" of the European Commission.
Although freedom of movement of workers is one of the "four freedoms" of the single market, many EU countries are trying to protect their national labour markets by suspending this freedom as long as possible.
Germany, in particular, argues that the high rate of unemployment resulting from the reunification of 1990 requires it to close its labour market to the new eastern Member States.
Such trends are dangerous.
Historically, protectionism has often led to economic disagreements, which can quickly escalate into more serious conflicts.
The signs are not good, even in Europe.
A recent Summit of EU leaders was to energy policy - domain object where cooperation is not only highly desirable but necessary.
However, even the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, clearly pro - European, went to the meeting with explicit intent to curb the creation of other European powers in this area.
Agreement German - Russian gas pipeline bypassing the Poland and Lithuania, with former Chancellor Gerhard SchrÃ¶der as playmaker, has already contributed to deteriorate relations between the Poland and Germany, not to mention the European cooperation.
For a time, the pendulum of public opinion has been fussing too far from the State - nation and its role.
It is one of the reasons why so many people felt distant from their political leaders.
But it would be unfortunate and even dangerous, that the pendulum back towards nationalism in the former.
The States - nations are welcome, they are important elements of a liberal world order.
But they must open to cooperation and coordination with others.
We must resist the birth of a trend that recalls the events of the first years of the twentieth century, trend that soon lead to a global disaster.
Gordon Brown is - it eligible?
Obviously, Gordon Brown wants to succeed Tony Blair as British Prime Minister.
However, it is less clear that it is ready to take the necessary steps to lead the labor party to victory in the next elections.
Indeed, it must deny the legacy of Blair, which at least means promise to get out the big - Brittany from the war in Iraq.
Brown covets the position of Prime Minister since May 12, 1994, fateful day when John Smith, the leader of the Labour Party then in opposition, died of a heart attack.
Two weeks later, on May 31, Blair and Brown met at a small restaurant in North London and discussed on the personality which should resume the leadership of the party.
At the end of their discussion, they have reached a double deal: Brown would remain aloof and would support Blair, who undertook in return to him give way later.
The fact that they are not agreed on the time or the circumstances of the transfer of power was also inevitable that decisive.
Obviously, they could not foresee that Blair would win three electoral successive victories, in 1997, 2001 and 2005, unprecedented for their party, and thus keep labour in power for unmatched duration that would probably last for 13 years.
The - key challenge for New Labour (according to the makeover of Blair who has worn his characteristic gift for handling) was the management of the British economy.
Since World War II, most British Governments have tried to manipulate the economy to promote their party in the short term, usually with disastrous results in the long term.
This lamentable tradition was common to the Conservatives and the Labour Party, and yet, as unfair as it may seem, it is the Labour that has been the most tainted by a reputation for inability to economic management.
Brown has changed decisively reputation.
Probably it was Minister of the most remarkable economy of British history, which is not to simply put on the account of inspiration or genius, but on the fact that it has established a new tradition giving priority to moderate inflation, low interest rates and stable government finances.
Brown understood that these priorities were essential, not only for the British economy, but for long term of Labour in power goals; also and it has fostered this program by giving the Bank of England independent responsibility to maintain inflation at a low level.
The result was that the Great - Britain has lived a decade unprecedented, marked by low inflation and relatively high economic growth, surpassing in this field many of his European counterparts.
Yet, despite economic success, it has become increasingly clear that Blair was finished.
Voters have gradually lost their illusions to the inevitable faults of a too familiar Government, and the party has shown increasingly unhappy face of a Chief who was abusing his hospitality.
Initially, Blair thought he could claim the right to remain in power time to a third five-year term.
But the pressure he had suffered from has continued to grow, to the point that he virtually promised to go away in the summer 2007.
No one knows exactly when or how Blair will give way.
If a formal competition for the leadership of the party is organized, it seems likely that more candidates will be on the ranks.
That said, virtually all observer authoritative on the subject seem to agree to designate Brown as by far the most likely to become the next Labour Prime Minister.
So much for the easy side.
From there, nobody seems to have the certainty that Brown knows what to do or has the capacity to lead and to win new legislative elections for the Labour.
Its reputation for control and control of the economy is also masterful only unquestioned, but he gave almost no indication on what he thinks of other government policies.
It remained cold and almost silent, visibly anxious to get his inheritance, but gave absolutely no clue on what would change if he could.
If there is one thing he cannot promise, is to continue Blair's policy.
If Brown elects continuity, it will lose.
After ten years of Blair, it shall propose one or more policies that will mark a clear fracture.
The choice of the most obvious policy change concerns the Iraq: If Brown wants to win an election as head of the Labour Party, he must renounce Blair's policy and announce the quick withdrawal of British troops.
In tactical terms, this should be as easy as obvious: whatever the reasons spurious and illegal data initially as a pretext to invade the Iraq, everyone knows now that this war was a political, strategic and moral disaster.
Everyone knows that it cannot be "won", so this means something, and Brown knows both the war and the servile submission of the Great - Britain to the Bush administration are deeply unpopular in the country.
This is the problem that it is more urgent to address: but for now, none of the main political parties has dared touch them.
Over the past three weeks, the Labour Party, the Liberal - Democrats and conservatives held their annual conference.
All have focused on national policies, none dared to broach the subject of the Iraq, because they know all this would raise the question of the withdrawal, which in turn would cause a major and possibly explosive debate on relations between Great - Britain and the USA.
Brown will be bold enough to face the issue of the Iraq?
Probably not.
It may very well decide that it is too difficult, in which case it will be an interim Prime Minister, condemned to lead the last three mandate of labour with no hope of winning the next elections.
Is certainly not what he had intended by passing its market with Blair in 1994.
The latest in economics.
The great depression powered John Maynard Keynes on the front of the stage of economic thought.
According to Keynes, private investment is inherently unstable because of the modes and passenger fads among investors, because of changes in "animal spirit" of businessmen or even because falling prices disrupt the economic system.
The Keynesians believed that prudent monetary policies (the central banks within or lowering interest rates to reduce fluctuations of private investment) could participate in the stabilization of the economy.
But they also believed that the Government should accept to become directly involved, with generous tax policies, to maintain the overall level of spending in a stable economy.
Such a policy, thought - they, would forever banish the spectre of large-scale mass unemployment, as was the case during the great depression.
Moreover, it could also possibly guarantee full employment in an efficient manner.
They planned that the virtually full employment would increase the threat of inflation.
After all, why the workers and trade unions should - they moderate their wage demands if Governments support expenditure whenever the threat of unemployment is booming?
A significant restriction of the requirements for wages high (fear of being dismissed when unemployment rises) had thus jumped.
What could replace it?
For the first generation of after - war, the predominant response was that the social - corporatist democracy would.
Trade unions comply with the requirements of the Government to moderate their own salary increase requirements and Governments do the bidding of the requirements of trade unions in public spending and social benefits.
Keynesian thinking assures us that ever the great depression cannot happen again.
Yet his solution to the problem of creeping inflation did not take the road and completely collapsed in the 1970s.
Following the first inflationary crisis of the early 1970s in the major industrialized countries, the predominant economic thought in these countries turned to channels "semi - monetarists".
The victory of Milton Friedman has never been as full as was that of the Keynesians.
However, in the mid-1980s, politicians from around the world agreed on the following points:
Central banks must commit credibly on the stability of prices in the long term.
Central banks must accept that the average unemployment rate should be determined not by "cyclical" factors but by structural factors that they should not try to solve.
Announce and an attempt to maintain a monetary growth target is an easy way for the Central Bank to disclose its main intentions, gain credibility and give outsiders a way to check if sound policies are followed.
Monetarism was that the reverse image of Keynesianism.
It seemed to guarantee that the inflation of the 1970s could never reproduce.
But he offered no solution to the problem of structural unemployment which appeared in Western Europe.
These last fifteen years have demonstrated that monetarism is ill equipped to manage the challenges of the fall of prices in the context of companies and heavily indebted banks just as Keynesian solution was not made to handle the challenges of inflation.
In the 1970s and 1980s, some, including myself, were the bankruptcy of social - democratic systems to control inflation on account of poor decisions.
Politicians did not understand that increase social benefits was the price to pay inevitably for the reduction of wages, while Union leaders did not understand that if the social - corporatist democracy was not limited inflation, political power would pass to the right and the rise in unemployment would be used to limit it.
Today, it still puts on the account of other bad decisions the current alarming economic conditions in the heart of the industrialized world (more than a decade of stagnation in Japan, accompanied by deflation, deflation also present in Germany, accompanied by recession).
European and Japanese central banks did not lower their rates of interest enough or early enough: banking sector regulators have turned from the mood swings of speculative lending and politicians have refused to extend sufficient fiscal policies.
But politicians and Governors of the central banks cannot be always considered as capable of making the right decisions. Good policies must be designed to operate despite the lack of vision and good advice of the leaders.
The inflation of the 1970s was only a natural failure of Keynesian political economies.
Deflation that threatens Japan, Europe and can - be even States - United for a long period of prospect between potential output and the actual output is a natural failure of semi - monetarist orthodoxy that has dominated the macroeconomic policies at the heart of industrialized world since the beginning of the 1980s.
We turn round.
Without so far form a circle: no Government would permit repetition of the collapse of liquidity as it occurred in the 1930s or the bankruptcy of banks and companies on a scale to put the totality of the economic system in danger.
It is an upward spiral.
The world's macroeconomic problems are real but do not lead to another great depression, largely because politicians remember this first great depression.
Need us a new economic policy in the Keynesian mode and semi - monetarist revolution, a revolution which will not lose (totally) view the successes of the previous but revolutions will eliminate their intrinsic defects.
Where may well come this revolution?
May be good to Ben Bernanke, the new Governor of the Federal Reserve, whose long career was always concerned about the price of assets, the role of adverse selection in the market of credit and need central banks in difficult circumstances not limited to current operations in the short term on open markets.
He believes that banks should try to pave the way for investments in long-term action.
Bernankeisme have you said?
The fate of humanity / hope of humanity.
For some time now, and certainly since the terrorist attacks on the States - United on 11 September 2001, all as in the past when we are witnessing the massacres in Kosovo, Sarajevo, Srebrenica, Rwanda, and Congo on our televisions, news talk more than war or threat of war, violent or threats of violent deaths deaths.
Around the world, we are all highly lucid as to the power of our weapons.
Missile warhead filled trucks with fertilizer or explosives worn on the belt, we used our technological capacity to greatly develop the dark side of our nature of violent biological species, to the role of predator poorly acted.
I certainly did not intend to minimize or dismiss this aspect of the history or current events.
I do not want that we forget that more than half of the previous century went for some kill shot, gazer, stab, burn, or starve one-tenth of the men living on this planet, whether because of the first world war or the famines that followed the great leap forward of Mao.
However, it is not a complete statement of places.
In fact, human abattoirs of the twentieth century - and the different slaughterhouses that prepare communities for today - may not appear in the future as the most important part of our experience and our human condition, not that our descendants will regard as their history.
For them, the most important features of our experience will be may be:

As a whole, the twentieth century world the witness of many regions remained desperately poor due to one or more reasons: (1) a criminal governance; (2) a lack of machines useful and productive in a global economy, to get out of agriculture of subsistence and industry services under - qualified; (3) a non-existent public educational system that could provide citizens with education and the know-how necessary for the use of these machines; (4) barriers (legal and physical) to prevent populations, where demand is low, to sell the product of their work where demand is high.
However, towards the end of the twentieth century, these four reasons of poverty were generally reduced.
Governments such as that of Kim Jong Il in North Korea are very rare nowadays.
Almost all countries of the world are more than a generation of near-universal literacy.
The speed of technological progress has created a cornucopia of inventions and innovations open to all regions that can send a student earn an engineering degree.
And above all, customs barriers that goods produced in Mauritius, Mozambique and Mauritania are sold in New York or Berlin and Santiago or Tokyo fall quickly.
Gigantic cargo ships that appeared on the seas recently have revolutionized global commerce in a generation.
New information technologies in the management of transport and distribution channels will probably have the same impact.
In addition, the advent of the Internet and the technology of the optical fibre cable will promote as many global industry services side exchanges that did the introduction of vessels at 100 iron-hulled steam fifty years earlier for international trade in agricultural and industrial products.
It will certainly take a generation for these changes is felt everywhere in the world.
However, in the heart of the industrialized world in the rich countries, concern was already of these revolutions that are looming on the horizon.
In fact, these concerns become stronger and whet as the fears of the citizens of these rich countries when trade barriers fall and redistributions of wealth, social order and the political world of the industrialized world will be shaken in their foundations.
For the world as a whole, however, the next two generations are those that will bring tremendous opportunities for economic growth and international prosperity.
There may be many safe Treasury at the end of the story, after all.
The defeat of the Argentine liberalism.
In the 1990s, the Argentina implemented policies that were at nearly 80% of the neo-liberal program.
It opened its economy to trade and international capital; It sought to guarantee low inflation and a stable currency.
She strove to improve its legal system so that its decisions are consistent with international law to generate some confidence when in respect of contract law, with or without a pot - de - vin.
This did not work.
So far, no person shall assert that the 1990s were disastrous, despite their consequences that led to the terrible summer of 2002.
Life was much more difficult during the 1970s dirty war, when an army stripped of all honor threw women from the top of helicopters in the South Atlantic ocean and urban guerrillas fired on the people because... because... and just because!
The 1980s were hardly better.
Opening by a debt to its paroxysm crisis caused by a massive increase in the value of the dollar and US interest rates, the Decade ended on a hyper - inflation generated indoors, which caused a decline in a decade in the Argentina, lagging behind the international leading economies.
During the 1990s, by contrast, the per capita GDP of the Argentina grew by 25%, with ups and downs, to finally lose all of this gain of growth over the past four years.
Until the end of last winter, the problems of the Argentina did seem to be little more than a - suddenly unpleasant but temporary, as the Mexican of the years 1994 "tequila" crisis - 1995 or even crises in the years 1997-1998 East Asia proved simple momentary interruptions, and not turning points.
Such optimism is impossible nowadays, and there is little hope that the recent stock market crash in this country has only temporary effects.
Opinion of the institutions, such as the Deputy Secretary of U.S. State to the economy, John Taylor, is that the collapse of the Argentina is due to its political class.
I share this opinion only in part.
Argentine leaders were warned repeatedly that the maintenance of a constant rate of Exchange and the pegging of the peso to the dollar might cause a recession if the value of the dollar increased.
Argentine politicians were also warned that their peso policy could not be sustained unless the ratio of national debt to GDP fall.
However, during the economic boom years, from 1993 to 1998, public spending exceeded enough tax revenue to get the ratio of debt / GDP from 29 to 44%.
When the dollar is mounted and the recession is installed, few major politicians unable to balance the budget of the State in time and time did not show enough courage to balance the budget when the situation hardens.
The final blow was dealt when the Government decided (in a crisis) to maintain bank deposits at fixed rate in dollars and remit the debt owed to banks into pesos, thus putting bankrupt entire financial system of the nation by a simple stroke of the pen.
The position of the ruling class is simple: If none of these three disastrous measures had been taken, the Argentina would not enter in crisis or would, at worst, suffered as a Mexican-style crisis mini.
The neo-liberal program of the 1990s Argentina was foolproof, according to this view, but Argentine politicians gave the image of a large community of clever fools.
There is, however, another way to see the argentine tragedy.
If we consider that the political system of the country long behaved predictably, producing with regularity of Governments that promised more that they could not be implemented.
That promise to the rich oligarchy does not collect high taxes.
That promise to workers and consumers generous social insurance system.
That promise rapid economic development, with generous infrastructure spending, bit binding and pleasant jobs for those who have political relations, etc.
Overall, these promise indicated that any view on national product always exceeded the total of 100%.
Demanding popular demand that the Government fulfill them all can never be satisfied.
Add to this an unfair distribution of wealth and income, lack of social engagement between the middle class and the working class and a long tradition of political violence, and one gets the perfect cocktail of a policy where all oppose at all.
The fundamental political battle of the distribution of wealth in Argentina remains to be resolved.
Any political force that will try to manipulate the auction by promising only what it can accomplish is condemned to defeat.
Thus, in Argentina, big budget deficits are an act of nature, an unshakeable fact.
Thus, Argentine interest rates can lower and be affordable on rare and short periods of time.
Everyone knows that the Argentine political system generates a chronic deficit, and we know that it does that indicate that the payment of interest on the debt were doomed to explode.
Because of the absolute lack of stability of the dynamics of the argentine debt, the indexation of the rate of Exchange on a strong currency could not last.
Free access to the international capital markets and dollar bank accounts meant that at the time where the exchange rate indexing would conflict with this policy logic argentine producer of deficit, the result could not only prove to be catastrophic.
If the current crisis had been deftly manipulated the Argentina lived another decade of rapid growth, the conflicts arising out of the redistribution of wealth would have moderated.
After all, Europe from before World War II demonstrated the worst policies in the world: the riots of the cliques of extreme - right in France to the General strikes of the Great - Britain through the civil war in Spain and the fascism in Italy, not to mention aggressive consolidation of power in Germany by Nazism.
And yet, the Western Europe of the after - war met no problems of public order which found solution while preserving the strong currency and growth.
I share this point of view only halfway yet.
Yes, the Argentine Government has made significant mistakes, its politicians sinned against the gods of the monetary economy.
But the punishment had to - she be so vivid and so severe?
The false promise of private pensions.
One of the most bizarre statements made during the discussions on social insurance today coming to disturb the richest country in the world poses that retirement programs funded by Governments and whose performances are fixed (such as the American social security system) are old fashioned.
These programs were sufficient, the argument at the time of the great depression and for the generation of the after - second world war, when the economy was based on industry, but they have become obsolete for the economy high-tech, networked, today's post - industrial.
Advocates of this argument propose a different model.
Companies accept today to support the pensions of employees by contributing to their private savings and current Governments should offer (or require) to contribute to this private savings.
The value of these accounts varies depending on the market and is not based on a defined benefit system that ensures a real sum fixed resource, available at retirement.
This argument is strange because it takes the economic situation to reverse - hair.
When many companies offer to their employees of retirees to fixed benefits in the long term, the Government has no interest to set up a parallel system of fixed benefits retirees and ask employees to participate.
After all, in this context, employees who give great importance to retirees on fixed benefits can go to work for companies that offer such systems.
The main advantages of a system where the Government requires that employees also participate in a national social security system are cumulative for the employees who should really give great importance to fixed benefit pension system without actually being able to determine their true preferences.
They are also cumulative for employees who do not have the ability to negotiate for their boss to offer retirees that they want to get, and they really need.
There are few companies today ready to offer fixed benefit pension systems in the long term.
One of the reasons is that companies today are more aware of their own fragility in the long term than they were in the years following the second world war.
Even IBM, at the USA -, that prides itself on its stability, does not want to take the risk of offering a fixed benefit pension system.
The risk of retirees to fixed benefits was usually offset by two advantages for companies that offer these systems.
First of all, the fact that leaving the company generally involved the repayment of this savings with a discount increased the loyalty of employees.
Then, optimistic assumptions of complacent Accountants on the benefits of reserve retirement, combined with the ability of large corporations to take more risk, improved the balance sheet that the companies could submit to their investors.
Today, the risks are perceived as many larger and as much lower benefits.
As a result, employers are less and fewer to offer systems that look closely or from afar retreats at fixed benefits.
This decrease of the systems fixed benefit in all rich countries of the world economy is not a good thing, because the configuration of the prices of the goods suggest that young and middle-aged employees attach very great importance fixed benefits systems.
Historically, the gap between the profits expected in property safer such as Treasury bills or investment vouchers and goods at high-risk such as shares or real estate was generally very large.
In sum, as say some economists, including Robert Barro of Harvard, and some mathematicians, such as BenoÃ®t Mendelbrot, this may be due to the fact that risky investments are in fact much riskier than suggests the theories and mathematics of standard financial techniques.
In my opinion, at least, this is due in part to the memory of the 1930s and 2000, when the stock market has suffered greatly, which looms too large in the minds of investors.
Employees and other holders of property value important to safety and predictability, also a fixed benefit pension system is very valuable.
But in today's world, only national Governments are large enough to implement such systems and guarantee that pensioners will be genuinely available when employees cease their activity.
I'm still enough social - democrat to believe that if there is an economic service or benefit to which citizens attach great importance and only the Government can offer, it is his duty to provide.
We know, we, economists, there are many disadvantages to push the Government out of its role of which is to provide for genuine public such as defence, security and justice services, while providing the citizens of incentives to offset the effects of the real failures of market.
Where the private market has the flexibility of both hands, the Government bureaucracy has better than two inches.
But the collection of taxes on wages to tens of millions of employees and tens of millions of retirement cheque writing part of routine tasks, semi - automatic that the Government be so well performed.
At the time where private companies retire systems fixed benefit, it is even more important and precious that the Government realizes then that our post - industrial society enters the era of networks, that it was in the past.
Islamist movements and the democratic paradox.
The wave of anger that across the Arab world over the publication in Denmark several months ago, of cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad, the victory of Hamas in Palestine and the increasing radicalization of the Iranian regime made "political islam" a fundamental international problem.
But there may be a single answer to all the questions that arise.
It is necessary to abandon the idea that there is a monolithic Islamist movement.
Political islam has different forms that emerged as the main alternative to the nationalist and secular Arab regimes whose legitimacy, based on the national liberation struggle, has disappeared because of their inability to resolve the economic and social problems, establish the rule of law and guarantee fundamental freedoms.
In Palestine for example, Islamists have prevailed over Fatah because they suffered during the years his bad governance while enduring the tests due to Israeli occupation.
For a long time America and Europe share an atavistic fear of "Islamic alternative" nationalist and secular leaders as those of Fatah and thereby defend the status - quo.
But the monarchs and secular dictators in the Arab world crushed all opposition, making mosques the only place safe from which the political commitment remained possible.
Today, political Islam can no longer be contained, because we cannot build democracy pushing underground parties which have a social base strong. This is what has tragically demonstrated the example of Algeria 15 years ago.
The only alternative to authoritarianism is to achieve a transition that allows Islamists to participate in political life, while encouraging them to accept unequivocally the rules of the democratic game.
In many countries, more or less conservative Islamist parties are ready to play the game.
It is not by chance if they are represented in the parliaments of all countries who have initiated policy reforms, be they the Lebanon where Hezbollah is present in a Government elected democratically, the Jordan or the Morocco.
In Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood became a force with which it takes in Parliament, this despite the limits imposed on the participation of Islamist groups during last year's elections.
In Iraq, free elections revealed the enormous influence of Islamist currents.
In Turkey, the democratic transition brought to power an Islamist party, the party of justice and development.
Under his leadership, the Turkish Government has undertaken various important democratic reforms and has started negotiations on the admission of the Turkey in the EU.
Islamist parties have nothing to do with Al Qaida, although some of the more conservative elements in their midst have ideological positions that can be closer.
The risk of a political transition that should lead to the victory of the Islamist parties constitute a democratic paradox that Europe and the US must accept if they want to promote a political evolution that includes all political sensibilities - i.e. the exact opposite of the imposition of democracy as it takes place in Iraq, under occupation by foreign troops.
One of the most negative consequences of the intervention in Iraq has been to strengthen the concept of a "clash of civilizations" between the West and Islam, which creates a favourable climate for Islamist movements.
The Muslim world proceeded to political reforms well before the "war against terrorism" and Muslim reformers do not have waited until the EU acquires political standing.
These movements have not been created in the USA or in Europe after September 11 and they do not expect a signal or help them to act.
The success of moderate Muslims may nevertheless depend on the attitude of the EU and the USA in their regard.
It is not necessary to show that democracy is the best path to the Palestinians if they want to create their State.
It depends for a large part of the direction that will take the new Hamas Government, which will be transformed or not a force democratic, respectful of the law, democracy and international law.
But this will also depend on Israel and the international community which must do everything in their power to foster the emergence of a future Palestinian State with Jerusalem as its capital.
Foster democracy among the Palestinians does not prevent the international community to ask Hamas to permanently renounce terrorism, to demilitarize, respect the Palestinian Constitution and recognize the existence of Israel.
But this does not mean to impose sanctions on the Palestinian people after it is expressed democratically.
If we want to strengthen the recent Palestinian democracy, it would be a terrible mistake that would have a negative impact in other Arab countries seeking to reform itself.
In the same way, recognize the right of non-violent Islamists to participate in political life does not mean cessation to political and ideological combat to defeat ultra - conservative and sometimes totalitarian society designs.
Combat racism, defend tolerance and respect the religious feelings of others does not imply questioning the freedom of the press or to accept the censorship that demand the Islamists, although authentic religious feelings are injured, as in the case of the Danish cartoons.
Islamist conceptions of society that violate individual rights must be rebutted politically.
This political challenge is one of the paradoxes of democracy, because it allows all ideas to freely compete with each other.
Political islam is a risk, but we cannot reduce it by developing a proper strategy, case by case, and that goes in the direction of democracy, but not by denouncing the result of democratic choice.
The war against the 'democratisation'.
The Lebanon and Gaza wars seriously threaten democratic reform in the South of the Mediterranean basin.
They inflict heavy sentences precisely to the peoples of the region leading to free and fair elections, and they undermine the legitimacy of the democracy of Israel.
Last year, the 'cedar revolution' has made the Lebanon an example of democratization in the Arab world.
The enthusiasm with which the international community welcomed these changes fell like a breath. The elections that recently took place in Palestine - another long-standing international requirement - are in the same case.
The signal is clear: it is preferable that Israel, the only country in the region to respect the rule of law, is surrounded by of authoritarian regimes where the results of the elections are predictable rather than democratic States where Islamists are likely to gain power.
It happened in Palestine and this could well happen in Egypt if the elections are conducted in a free and fair manner.
The Arab nationalist Governments could then justify resistance to large-scale political reforms and the Suppression of any internal opposition, especially with growing Islamist movements.
It is now obvious to everyone that the democratization of the South of the Mediterranean cannot be ruled out Islamist movements and that the success of the process depends largely on the degree with which the participation of these movements is ensured in the political arena.
Of course, still be - it renounce violence as a means of taking power.
Contain political Islam, or again, attempt to "delete" the Islamists at the military level without taking into account the national political process (and not to mention human lives), is not a solution, because voters will not divert to Islamist movements.
The efforts of reformist Governments in the region to incorporate these movements into the public sphere have received a severe blow.
Democracies have long known that heavy retaliation inflicted without distinction - which by definition affect both the Allied enemies, fighters and civilians - constitute a serious violation of international law, as did observed Louise Arbour, High Commissioner of the United Nations in human rights.
They also know that such actions inflame radicalism and the impact that we know only too well today.
Hezbollah is, after all, a creature born from the resistance of the Lebanon invasion of Israel in 1982. The "party of God" tries to win again at home and in the region presenting itself as the defender of the Arab - Islamic cause, particularly in Palestine.
Any reinforcement of its power will in fact weaken the Lebanon and the democratic forces in the region.
The absence extended a real active commitment of States - United in the process of peace in the Middle - East is partly responsible for the current slump.
For nearly six years, the latter did not weight diplomatic initiative to resolve the Palestinian question, nor to the Syrian track (Israel still occupies the Golan Heights).
Moreover, even as we begin to think that the Iraqi tragedy had lifted the veil on the limits of unilateral disarmament and preventive military strategies, the Government of Bush encourages Israeli military action - this time against a country that is painfully to consolidate its democratic reform and to reaffirm its sovereignty on the Syria.
Bush the most promising initiative, consisting of promoting democracy in the Middle-East, has been paralysed by the intervention in Iraq and the ensuing civil war.
This project is now crushed under the weight of the American inability to protect the fragile democracy of the Lebanon and Palestine democratic experience.
The unconvincing reaction of the European Union to the conflict raging in Gaza and the Lebanon oscillates between understanding and condemnation of the disproportionate response of Israel (not not "eye for an eye", but "ten eyes for an eye", according to the Finnish Presidency of the Council of the EU), revealing how the Union depends on the States - United to put an end to the violence.
If the current dispute does not encourage the Europeans to speak with a single voice, it means that they have learned no lesson of disunity, so the weakness, which has harmed them during the war in Iraq.
Should be a European initiative supported by credible means of military deterrence, combining the forces of the EU, the Turkey and the Arab countries, dispatchee in the Lebanon and Gaza as part of a United Nations mission.
Europe must not only require one stop - the - immediate ceasefire and put an end to the interference of the Syria and the Iran to the Lebanon, but it must also have the means to translate their requirements into reality and bring massive aid to the reconstruction of the Lebanon.
The EU must firmly support the end of the embargo on Palestine and the urgent creation of a Palestinian State.
A common European front could persuade the States - United to leave enough time to the Lebanon and Palestine to consolidate their democratic processes, and therefore isolate the radical elements of Hamas and bring Hezbollah to disband his private army.
The American project in ruins, a credible policy of delegitimation of war and support for democracy in the countries of the region is essential.
The environment of the economy.
No economy is a closed, autonomous universe governed by independent laws of the law, morality or policy.
The most interesting economic issues generally lie on the border of neighbouring disciplines.
This may appear more clearly than in the interaction between economic processes and the environment.
The particularity of this Exchange is to not be governed by the laws of mechanics, but by those of thermodynamics, particularly the law of entropy that the amount of free energy may be transformed into mechanical work diminishes with time - an irreversible process culminating in the 'heat death'.
Under the leadership of Nicholas Georgescu - Roegen - whose work on the relationship between economic processes and physics were pioneers - many researchers tried without much success to formulate a 'entropy' theory of the economy and society, in particular during the 1970s.
The entropic view assumes that because of its many interactions with nature, economic processes produce irreversible consequences.
We draw in stocks of non-renewable natural resources (oil and mineral resources, for example) and degrade or qualitatively change other resources (e.g. water and agricultural land) by imposing a rhythm of operation greater than their capacity for regeneration.
The exploitation of non-renewable resource stocks also releases the 'speed' of the economic growth of the ecological rhythm, which contributes to the degradation of the biosphere, including irreversible climate changes.
The law of entropy reminds us that a natural heritage smaller and probably less adapted to their needs and ourselves to future generations than that which we inherited.
Unfortunately, there are no simple solutions.
Name of what principle could it apply to China and India to limit their economic dynamism to reduce their levy on the planet's natural resources?
The lower growth of the developed countries is not the result of a voluntary self-limitation, but our much higher standard of living and our inability to adjust our own economic imbalances.
We cannot impose the poorest that we rate green, then that is due to be released which has enriched us with!
For a similar reason, the decay or even stagnation are not more a solution within developed countries: this would imply either that it accommodates existing inequalities, it imposes a regime of redistribution to economic resources.
It would be an unbearable cynicism versus a totalitarian utopia.
But fortunately for us, our evolution depends not only of entropy, but also the increase of knowledge and technical progress - just as irreversible as the decrease in stocks of non-renewable resources or degradation of the environment.
Thus, the economy has a character entropic for resources and historical for the production, organization and dissemination of knowledge. The prospects for sustainable development in economic and environmental terms fit in the space between these two dynamic processes: the level of growth that is chosen should be based on a sufficient level of knowledge to ensure the sustainability of the system.
However the nature such as knowledge are public goods that require the intervention of the State to be 'produced' in sufficient quantity.
The only solution to the problem of the finitude of our world is to maintain a space as large as possible between entropy and history by investing in education and research with a view to increasing the share of renewable energy, reduce consumption of energy to our standard of living and slow the rate of exploitation of natural resources.
Such a strategy may seem useless if it only effect us opt out to allow others to get rich faster.
But designed as doing the mastery of two dynamic processes, the ecological constraints may be a growth accelerator.
The stem-cell race continues.
Scientific research is generally conducted to improve our lives, but it is also an industry, an industry that represents a huge investment on the part of Governments and companies.
Issues and profit potential of certain research topics, few in number, are exceptionally high, and that is why the recent announcement that Korean researcher Hwang Woo - suk fabricated its results of research on embryonic cells have known such repercussions.
This episode highlights relentless international competition, medical research which is played in the field of embryonic stem cells.
This is probably one of the biggest challenges of any medical history that is within the reach of all, and everyone else, really everyone could win the jackpot.
The last great scientific competition of this type dates back to the time of the deciphering of the human genome, that promises to change the future of a radical.
This study was initiated by the USA - from discoveries made in the wake of the nuclear bombing of Japan on the understanding of the scope of genetic damage in the long term.
The research effort currently on embryonic stem cells and their potential is just as important because it will allow a total medical revolution just as important.
An embryonic cell is special because it can duplicate a shape that is different.
So that a cell of our skin or in our liver, for example, can that reproduce more skin or liver, embryonic cells, which are more robust at the beginning of human development are the "prototype" cells.
When a fertilized egg turns into an embryo and then fetus, these original embryonic cells show one way or another to the cells to produce transforming skin, liver, eye, or os.
We need to find out how this transformation is triggered.
Such knowledge would lead to enormous progress can lead to patents.
A strong focus is on genetic diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and myopathy.
In these cases - there, embryonic cells would be used to repair nervous tissue.
This would also benefit the patients of cervical lesions or column spine, any patient who suffered an attack of paralysis.
This is beyond in parallel fields, such as gene therapy.
An embryonic cell changes identity through a process of "trigger", a signal that literally activates the liver cell gene in embryonic version of the cell.
When researchers have understood how to turn these switches, it may be possible to introduce embryonic cells in the human body and activate them so that they replace appropriately tissue damaged, whatever they may be.
Therefore, it is not surprising, given its huge potential, that whole teams of researchers are mobilized almost everywhere to engage in research on embryonic cells.
This race has acquired some dynamism from that the main actor of research, States - United, is in emerged, because of the influence of religion on politics (even if the State of California has decided not to miss and has recently approved a grant of 3 million USD for the cell research embryonic).
The promises being so large, science not needing infrastructure massive, many are small countries which themselves are rushing into the vacuum created by the States - United in this field to take advantage.
Any competent medical research centre can begin in this race, be it to the Mexico, Ethiopia, Indonesia, or the Yemen.
The winner will be able to bring to the economy of his country the equivalent of a Saudi oil field.
But even if everyone can prevail, science, at this level, not just a simple "eureka" or a simple step that would suddenly put an end to this race.
The discoveries are incremental, and because it is of science, each step is announced and tested.
Therefore, the institutions involved in the research can acquire a certain momentum, leaders attract talent, resources and prestige in an intellectual ecology which isn't relaxing.
Found within the competition of many other small races, which are scrambling to produce rapid and impressive results.
In May 2005, the centre of research of Hwang in Seoul made State of a first success of importance.
They reported developing a technique where new embryonic cells in perfect condition could be cloned from ordinary cells.
This was big news, because they imply that a sufficient number of embryonic cells could be created without controversy, thus allowing everyone to quality research while avoiding that US president George W. Bush has described as "the use of a life to save a life".
In addition, Koreans are then passed to a common step nowadays and demanded the rights of patents in the process.
You could almost believe for a moment that South Korea would become the world superpower's health issues.
We now know that Korean researchers invented the case from scratch.
The survey conducted by a panel of the Seoul National University investigation concluded that "cloned" stem cells were actually created by fertilizations in vitro.
This fraud has surprised throughout the scientific community, particularly because the Korean researchers was so clearly impracticable.
Why have - they then put their careers and their reputations at stake?
Medical research has always had to face many challenges, even when the scientific quest was only a matter of discovery.
Today, the challenges are complicated policy, market forces and national interests.
With embryonic research, large fortunes depend on the group that will take the lead, wherever his laboratory is located.
While the competition heats up, we expect amazing developments, and no doubt other subterfuges in public relations.
Islam and Asian Chinese diaspora.
When the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, recently announced that he intended to resign, Malaysians of Chinese descent joined Mahathir's Malay party loyalists asking him to reconsider.
When Mahathir agreed to stay only for 16 months, pushed by these Chinese Malay sighs of relief were audible all.
The fact that ethnic Chinese Malaysians to be rallied on the side of Dr. Mahathir brand a quiet revolution in Malay politics that demonstrates how the nationalist image of Mahathir is relaxed during his 22 years in power.
It also shows how the ethnic Chinese have changed their opinion about the nationalist movement which previously seemed so hostile.
During the overthrow of the colonial rulers of the four decades before South - East Asia, the ethnic Chinese have often fled nationalist movements that fought for independence.
Some movements saw the local Chinese and foreigners or as intrinsically unfair people for having shot advantage years of imperial reign in a disproportionate manner.
Violence collective anti - Chinese was widespread in the region.
In the decades that followed, most Chinese have continued to be wary of political parties associated with the former national liberation movements.
This fear is dissipating in Malaysia.
Chinese citizens of Malaysia now consider Prime Minister Mahathir as a bastion against a new form of violent extremism: the threat posed by Muslim fundamentalism.
A such bulwark is essential for members of the vast Chinese diaspora in all South - East Asia, not only in Malaysia, where extremist Islamic remained a minimal threat, but also in Indonesia where of thousands of Chinese have been killed and injured in riots in recent years and where of thousands others have seen their property damaged or lost.
Most ethnic Chinese in South - East Asia admire as a gemstone presence even a hint of allegiance to a secular distinction between faith and State in a Muslim leader.
When this distinction exists among Islamic believers like Mahathir, evidence of secular tolerance represents a rare sign of modernity and commitment to progress.
Dr. Mahathir has always been a modernist to the cool head.
Recently, it began to admit that "Malays first" policies that it has encouraged since 1969 have failed to give birth to a skilled Malay elite essential to a modern economy.
Mahathir called the Malay youth to work hard even though it is fully aware that such an appeal is unpopular.
A large part of this new tone in the ethnic policies of the Malaysia has gone unnoticed because of the tumult surrounding the efforts made by Mahathir to discredit his former Deputy, Anwar Ibrahim.
This campaign of denigration of Mr. Anwar cost Mahathir's Party, the United Malay National Organization (UMNO), much of its support among ethnic Malays.
Indeed, in the national elections of 1999, Mahathir retained power only through Chinese voters.
The non-Malays hope now that it will reconsider the idea of special treatment for ethnic Malays.
Such a reform is still anathema among Malays.
The ethnic Chinese of Malaysia are also impressed by the clever response of Dr. Mahathir in the U.S. fight against terrorism requirements.
The Prime Minister has used this opportunity to soften its image of man opposed to the West by reaffirming its modernist and secular position against all those who sympathized with Islamic extremism.
In so doing, he has revitalized the multi-cultural base of the National Alliance, which has led Malaysia since independence proclaimed in 1957.
This allowed him to rally the Chinese community in Malaysia at his side.
Put this situation in contrast to the Chinese of Indonesia, a country where everything secular and modern is associated with political and cultural compliance with the State - nation.
For thirty years, former President Suharto has systematically established racial discrimination against the ethnic Chinese while promoting a few privileged comrades who helped his family and his military colleagues make huge ill-gotten profits.
In the eyes of the poor remained indigenous majority, such favouritism depicts the Chinese as corrupt and greedy unscrupulous people.
Despite memories of the massacre of Chinese during the anti-Communist purges of the 1960s, the Chinese of Indonesia were not prepared to face immense hatred deployed during the riots of May 1998 where arson and looting, as well as gang rapes of several Chinese women, ravaged the Chinese community.
Such violence still casts a shadow on the ethnic relations in Indonesia.
Successive Indonesian Governments headed by the Presidents Habibie, Abdulrahman Wahid and Megawati Sukarnoputri have all encouraged the Chinese to play a customary role in trade.
However, Indonesian officials are reluctant to guarantee the Chinese that they will retain equal rights as citizens and they have allowed various forms of discrimination to crack down.
The current tensions between the secularists, religious believers and various Muslim extremist groups of Indonesia rejected the Chinese in the shadows, allowing many to resume their economic role in conditions of growing uncertainty.
But the personal security they seek and the ethnic Chinese of Malaysia are about to get is always as far as ever.
Indeed, it is highly unlikely that the Indonesia produce a leader on which they could count in the same way as the Malaysia Chinese now rely on Prime Minister Mahathir.
Football and philosophy.
Gooooal!
Divine serenity, or infernal burning, according to the team that scores: ours or theirs.
How the trajectory of a ball - she be responsible for so many happiness or pain?
I spent weeks sitting in front of my TV to watch the World Cup.
My wife threatens to divorce and other disciplinary measures.
What is the source of this attraction, this magic?
The game world is our perpetual garden of Eden.
You may at any time abandon our reality for freedom, innocence and the joy of the game.
The foot and the garden of Eden?
What were - they in common?
Each defines a sphere sacred freedom and order, innocence, spirituality and justice from our everyday world of chaotic, slave, unjust and guilt.
Exchequer, tennis court, football pitch: in the perimeter, we feel free, because in these places, it is we who decide the rules without being subject to the law of iron from the outside world.
It feels innocent, too, because the game world is also a world of innocence: a garden of Eden for before the fall.
There we can be childish and selfish, we can satisfy our need for success, power and domination, and all this without any guilt.
In the game world, freedom is generated, paradoxically, by the restrictions.
Football, the basic rule is simple: the ball must move, the central point in the nets of one of the two goal cages.
If the ball was heading directly to the focal point in a cage, its path would be, or would seem to be, strictly determined and the set would be pretty boring.
To create a certain freedom, settled in the way the ball is managed to complicate the displacement.
First, two teams of 11 players are placed on the ground with mission is to place the ball in the goal cage.
Then, they are asked to put the ball in the cage of the goals of the other side.
Through twenty-two players with their competence and their own will, through different movements of confrontation and cooperation, the number of possible combinations is so high at infinity.
As a result, you need more that a single factor to create a real world of happy surprises, freedom and happiness: the ball.
The balloons are the most important elements in the "creation of freedom" in our lives.
A ball is freedom personified.
He can bounce in any direction.
It seems to be equipped with an own will.
It is an object, and yet it seems to be free.
With the introduction of a factor of chance and unpredictability in the game, the ball turns an embittered human struggle and land ashore in an epiphany of spirituality and freedom.
At the discretion of its sharp movements, random and will interact, dance, do somersaults with the other.
The ball springs from below there full of reckless irresponsibility, between the will of men, random, freedom and the limitation, success and failure, hope, and despair, to bounce back in the world of hope in the next moment.
It has its own universe.
It moves in the sphere of the sacred.
But there is no sacred without the profane.
The football pitch is bounded and opposed to the surrounding world.
The experience and the sacred ceremony would be incomplete if tension between the field and the stands did not exist.
Clear Emerald field and the freedom of the game must be in opposition to the screaming crowd of darkness forums, burning red flares and the forth - sharp between the joyous ecstasy and hellish misery.
In our lives daily, the reason and passions mingle.
Football (like other sports) separates the two areas and between them.
All the passions, emotions and instincts are pushed towards the spectators.
They enrage and praise, strut and explode, finally reaching the catharsis (if their team wins) or hell (if their team loses).
At the same time, they look, perceive and make the experience of Platonic freedom or Apollonian of the game which takes place on the ground.
Yes, players move in a world of spirituality.
They act according to clear rules, sacred.
When they play, they are supposed to act as beings pure rationals, which leave behind the passions and emotions, fears and wishes respondents to their daily lives.
They move in a world of morality and pure justice.
The world of the player is a world of justice and total impartiality; perfect equality of opportunities, that it never gets on a daily basis.
Even the advantage that gives the direction of the wind is mastered.
The two teams change aside in mid - time.
Where and when to see - on the privileged and the poor change in the real world?
Players, too, are not supposed to waive the rules.
If they do, they are punished, and if they start again, they are excluded from the game.
They are excluded from the sphere of spirituality and we see them disappear into the icy underworld locker rooms.
The final expulsion of the paradise occurs only if the sanctity of the game has been desecrated, the spell is broken: by players deprived of their angelic roles and engaging in a fight on the ground, by an arbitrator cheater, by the public, including that a match has been arranged by spectators invading the field.
Such events mark long the public and the community.
It's a bitter shock to realize the fragility of our world of freedom, spirituality, dignity and awaken again (as we will do it when the winner of the World Cup will be known) in our world nothing less than hostile.
Egypt needs a president, not a Pharaoh.
A heated debate on political reforms currently shakes Egypt.
Issued of all political opposition and civil society groups, it focuses on a request for an amendment of the Constitution of 1971 and for the abolition of the State of emergency declared in Central the assassination of Sadat.
These claims were nothing new.
Moubarak and the national Democratic Party that supports oppose since the mid-1980s.
But, because of the disturbing turn taken by events in Egypt, in the region and to the - beyond the requirement of reforms now takes a compelling,
Internally, the 76-year-old president Moubarak and his State of health are of concern.
The rumors about this run for years, but they have been confirmed officially in November 2003, when it was no longer possible to hide the situation.
While he addressed the Parliament, Mubarak fainted before the eyes of millions of viewers.
Although he returned an hour later to finish his speech, Egyptians began to call for greater transparency, both in relation to the health of the president than the functioning of the State.
At the same time, the deterioration of the economic situation, the high unemployment rate and widespread corruption have led to despair a part of youth.
More than half of the Egyptian population was born under the chairmanship of Mubarak.
According to a recent report of the United Nations, half of young people between 15 and 30 years dream of emigrating to Europe, North America or Australia.
Each week, articles speak for Egyptians who drowned in the Mediterranean as they try illegally to Europe.
A few weeks ago, several young died suffocated while it returned to Egypt in overcrowded trucks crossing the Libyan desert.
This case has led to the protests that have forced the authorities to stop, question and bring to justice the responsible Egyptian police facts.
The situation in the region and in the world has made the opposition more daring, not only to demand reforms, but also to amend the articles of the Constitution affecting the Presidency.
According to persistent rumors, Mubarak, who has already been re-elected four times, would seek a sixth term or to establish a kind of "hereditary Republic". He would prepare his son Gamal, 41, to succeed him, the image of Syrian president Hafez Al - Assad to his son Bashar.
The opposition battle cry is no, no to the re-election of Mubarak and no to Gamal for him succeed.
Many Egyptians have nothing against Gamal Mubarak as such, but they are mortified at the idea that after the father for 24 years, they may be inflicting the son for the same duration.
On 211 articles in the current Constitution, which dates from October 1971, 30 are related to the Presidency.
The appointment of the president by a majority of two-thirds of the people's Assembly is then ratified by a plebiscite which cannot be answered by Yes or no.
The Presidency six years, acquired thus by simple majority, is renewable indefinitely in this way.
The laxity of these procedures is in sharp contrast with the scope of presidential power.
The president is both head of State and Commander in Chief, he chairs the supreme Council of the judiciary, the police and the Council of Ministers. It may in its discretion appoint and dismiss one or more vice - presidents.
It designates the Prime Minister and senior Ministers and approves the designation of other Ministers, ambassadors and senior officials.
It can call general elections, declare war and declare a State of emergency and promulgate decrees that have the force of law.
There is no balance of power.
An article states that "the president may be impeached for high treason or any other criminal act if a motion by at least one third of the members of the people's Assembly is approved by two-thirds of them".
The president is then suspended from his duties and replaced by the vice president pending the conclusion of the process.
But Mubarak has never promulgated the law necessary to the implementation of this article nor even named a vice president, despite repeated requests from all sides.
This has resulted in de facto "imperial presidency" with Mubarak the Pharaoh instead.
No other head of State in modern history only brings his hands as much power than him.
In Egypt, compared more readily to Brezhnev, who presided over two decades to stagnation and decline of the Soviet Union.
In the same way, the position of Egypt as regional power collapsed under Mubarak.
On the economic front, the flow of foreign investments has tumbled by 3 billion per year in the mid-1990s to some ridiculous 300 million in 2003.
The demands for reform are now concentrating on the election of the president by universal with at least two candidates suffrage and prohibition more of two successive mandates.
But it must also reduce presidential power in there as abusive and create effective mechanisms to ensure that all government officials without exception have to account for their actions.
If Mubarak and his Government do nothing to make the claimed constitutional amendments be adopted, more and more Egyptians will flee the regime and risk their lives to seek salvation elsewhere.
Bush should no longer play in the Gulf.
President Bush has asked Americans not "play politics" at this time of terrible national disaster.
But ask embarrassing questions of our nation's leaders is exactly what requires democracy, at a time where the the Government response to Hurricane Katrina is widely regarded as "a national disgrace".
Katrina announced his arrival at least two days in advance, but the authorities have been slow to launch an evacuation order.
No means of transportation was available to those who had neither money, nor car. facilities home and care for refugees were insufficient, the necessary forces were not in place to deliver supplies crucial or to ensure order, and the number of boats, helicopters and other equipment necessary for the rescue of those who found themselves blocked was far from adequate.
Hampered by a national guard which 40% of the workforce are in Iraq, the speed of mobilization of the military to the most affected areas has been slow out of the ordinary.
For four days, there simply was no commands and clear control centre.
As a result, many victims have suffered and died.
This failure is largely due to the policies of the Bush Government, which effectively eroded the capacity of the Federal Management Agency (Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA) emergency, government agency whose first mission is to manage disasters.
Obsessed with the war on terrorism as well as the ideology of privatization of government functions, the administration has systematically undermined the ability of FEMA to avoid disasters in the long term or at least absorb impacts when prevention is still possible.
FEMA has been restricted and demoted from his cabinet position, prior to be placed under the aegis of the Department of national security.
Its mission planning and disaster preparedness was completely ousted, for the benefit of the fight against terrorists.
Its leaders have no disaster management experience.
The previous Director was one Texan political cronies of Bush, and the qualifications of the current Director include the task of Commissioner to the judges and the service of the International Arabian Horse Association, where he was forced to resign for "lack of supervision".
Since 2001, billions of dollars were deferred the disaster management assistance to national security and the war in Iraq.
Programs - key disaster relief have seen their budgets melt like snow in the Sun and federal funds have been reduced by half.
The budget of the Army Corps of Engineers for the construction of dams in the New - Orleans was looted, including the funds specifically allocated to control of urban floods in South - West of Louisiana.
Prevention measures to protect the population and properties have not been implemented despite the findings of the FEMA even in 2001, specifying that a major hurricane that hit New Orleans was one of the three "most likely disasters and most catastrophic that might hit the nation".
Convinced that FEMA was a "disproportionate social programme" and that "the work of the Government is not to provide services", first the Bush FEMA Director instituted requirements for external supply in a major privatization effort.
This phenomenon has caused a brain drain because many executives of FEMA are oriented towards the private sector.
Privatization has also developed States and poorest communities in a particularly vulnerable situation.
That funding had Federal programs were delivered into the hands of private companies at higher rates, only States and the richest and politically consequential communities afford to lay claim to the rare Federal allocations necessary to pay for the services.
For example, Florida (who owns 16 votes more than Louisiana and Governor is the brother of the President) received funding requested to protect its wetlands.
On the other hand, Louisiana, which has greater needs (with its incredible 24% poverty rate), was denied in 2004 its application of Fund to avoid flooding.
Given that the ability of Louisiana to protect themselves was weakened and the centre management undermined disaster, the Government's inadequate response and unnecessary destruction were almost inevitable. And it is the poor who in have paid the price.
But the reasons for the failure of this administration exceed the diversion voluntary and chronic resource of programs designed to protect people from disasters.
Despite the scientific evidence proving that the intensity and the increasing frequency of hurricanes are related to climate change, the Bush administration rejects any participation in international programs aimed at preserving the climate.
Rather than comply with the prohibition of wetlands development instituted by previous administrations, Bush chose to delete.
Erosion caused by urban development brought 30-km Gulf of Mexico of the land compared with 1965, hurricanes are able to concentrate more force and cause winds and waves at the speed and the ever stronger destructive power.
Similarly, the reduction of wetlands threatened the levees of New Orleans, built on the principle that 60 to 80 km of protective wetlands serve as buffer between the city and the Gulf of Mexico.
Despite all major studies showing that a rehabilitation programme alongside large-scale and high dyke construction was necessary to protect New Orleans, the Government has allowed federal agencies to protect 8,000 ha of wetlands, developers drying hundreds of hectares and in 2004 decreased by more than 80% funding hold back the waters of Lake Pontchartrain.
New Orleans has raised the alarm of America.
The ideologies of privatization, which prevent govern effectively and allow for the privileged to save their skin while the poor must climb on roofs, must now be challenged.
This disaster is a terrible reminder of what happens when a Government fails to protect its citizens, and it is imperative that Americans demand accounts.
Staff members who have not done their job must be returned, and the elected officials whose policies aggravated the devastation inflicted by Katrina dismissed.
We owe it to the dead and the survivors.
The fall of the Commander.
Only Gabriel Garcia Marquez could find the right words to describe the expectation of the death of Fidel Castro.
His novel, the autumn of the Patriarch captures perfectly the moral misery, paralysis policy and fierce boredom that buries a society awaiting the death of a dictator in the long course.
The departure from power of the commandante Fidel is only a matter of biology, and rare photos of him that have appeared since he fell ill last year clearly show nature at work.
When the end comes, change in Cuba may well have as much magnitude than any of those that greeted the end of the great dictators of the last century.
Stalin, Franco, Tito, Mao: their methods and their means were similar all.
The manner in which they came out scene was often very different however, and these differences model companies for the years and decades following their death.
Take the example of the Soviet Union.
On March 9, 1953, of the Gulf of Finland to the Bering Sea, everything stopped, just like in Warsaw, Budapest, Prague and Berlin - East.
In Beijing, Mao Zedong him - even well down greeted a huge effigy of Joseph Stalin.
To huge crowds in mourning, grieving, almost hysterical, Ã©panchÃ¨rent in the vast empire over which Stalin had ruled.
And yet, in a few days, the word Stalinism was removed from a new Soviet dictionary, and three years later my grand - father, Nikita Khrushchev, denounced the "cult of personality" of Stalin in his famous "secret speech" at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party.
The thaw that followed was short-lived, but for the first time in Soviet history the possibility of change was contemplated - possibility that Mikhail Gorbachev seized 1985.
The death of Marshal Josip Broz Tito provoked bloodshed of any other kind.
For decades, his reign had imposed a false unit in Yugoslavia.
After his death in 1980, this artificial state began to disintegrate, culminating with the genocide in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo wars in the 1990s.
But all long dictatorships do not end in disintegration and chaos.
Mao's death permitted the return from exile of Deng Xiaoping fell out of favour.
Deng mit quickly routed the heirs of the "gang of four", and in a few years, opened the Chinese economy, feeding a capitalist revolution that transformed China more fully, and with more success, that Mao's socialist revolution it never had done.
Of course, the Communist Party remains in power, and the portrait of Mao is still on Tiananmen.
But like the other one are more than relics of ideas and ideals that in reality have been relegated to the trash of history.
Spain, she also escaped violent dissolution when Generalissimo Francisco Franco's fascist dictatorship collapsed at his death.
The old dictator can take credit this success, since restoring the monarchy of King Juan Carlos just before his death, he gave to the Spain a foundation on which to rebuild.
Franco was far from imagining that Juan Carlos would build, assisted by an intelligent and young the Franco era bureaucrat named Adolfo Suarez, Spain modern and democratic today.
It is no coincidence if the Communist countries were (and are still) usually run by the gerousia, and democracies by men and younger women.
This difference is important.
Old leaders can preside successfully in countries where everything works quietly, and that don't require a further review of their policies and their objectives.
There are exceptions to this rule, of course - Churchill, Adenauer, Deng, Reagan - but States cannot count on fortune to grant them an exceptional leader.
The younger leaders are more likely to be able to manage multiple changes in difficult times.
Political competition requires all politicians, regardless of their age, to remain alert and to anticipate problems, and to remain open to new ideas.
No one can remain installed his high office to wait without doing anything that death or boredom come take it.
Single-party systems, dictatorships playing on the charisma of a single man or a mixture of the two, as in Tito's Yugoslavia, are a guarantee of sclerosis of the spirits and government inaction.
What will become of Cuba after the death of Fidel?
Many observers describe RaÃºl Castro, the younger brother of Fidel and his designated successor, as a pragmatist - the "practical Castro".
When Soviet largesse have ceased in the early 1990s, it was RaÃºl who realized that the regime's survival depended on economic reforms and has lobbied to allow private agricultural markets to be reopened in order to boost production and avoid a possible famine.
However, it is the same man who, at the head of the apparatus of internal security of Cuba, was for many years the iron hand of the regime, and who is directly responsible for the imprisonment and torture of thousands of dissidents often.
Then may be that the best that can be hoped is an experience Russian liberalisation quickly stifled by the old nerve guard of the regime.
In addition, with the support of oil-rich allies President Venezuelan Hugo ChÃ¡vez - and with the recent discovery of reserves of crude off the coast the Cuban coast, introducing reforms could very well be less urgent.
In this case, RaÃºl could try to cling firmly to the fossilized system he helped to create and maintain with such brutality.
But RaÃºl Castro is him - even an old man, so we can hope that a Deng or, better yet, a SuÃ¡rez, emerges from the sinking of the well-supplied.
Having said that, for the moment, the young Cuban Communist representatives, as Foreign Minister Felipe PÃ©rez Roque, remain fanatics of the ideology that many Cubans call "los Taliban".
If they take power and keep your finger off the trigger, Cuba may well have to face a new and very long lesson in biology.
The ECB is now anchor in Europe.
The time has come for the European Central Bank to build a reputation.
One month after the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty of the European Union in France and the country - low, the recent Summit of the European Union in Brussels ended in a snapping orgy of national self-interest without that no agreement on the budget of the Union.
With Europe in full political turmoil, the ECB must present itself as a stabilizing anchor.
Europe suffers from a deep confidence crisis which handicapped its economic recovery.
Consumers, lacking confidence in the ability of their political leaders to solve these multiple problems, save for a rainy day that they believe very close, while businessmen are reluctant to invest because they do not trust Governments to implement the necessary economic reforms.
As demonstrated by the shameful Brussels Summit, this lack of confidence in the political leadership of the European Union is quite justified.
Instead of acting effectively and constructively on the problems of Europe â the reform of expensive State medical protection systems for improved global competitiveness â Europe's political leaders are hiding behind spurious arguments on "models anglo - saxons ultra - liberals", the British budget rebate and interest rates high, as if the economic weaknesses were due to errors of the ECB.
To undermine the independence of the ECB, the European finance ministers seek to gain more weight in the decision-making of the Bank.
Jean - Claude Junker, Prime Minister of the Luxembourg and president of the Eurogroup, testifying to the "Economic and financial affairs" Council for the Parliament of the European Union, said that the Finance Ministers of the euro area should be more energetic in the expression of their positions vis - Ã  - vis the ECB. He called for "open and Frank" talks between Ministers of the Eurogroup and the ECB.
Who needs these talks?
A common overall, eurozone finance ministers want to discuss interest rates lower, which will not help the economic recovery of Europe.
The ECB has already allowed to extend the period of monetary stability that crosses Europe with interest rates at the lowest in years.
Can you really believe that consumers refuse to consume - and businessmen to postpone their investments - waiting for the next drop of interest rates?
To paraphrase Mr. Keynes, cannot be drinking a donkey who is not thirsty.
"The last thing Europe needs now is a reduction in interest rates" declared an influential member of the ECB's Governing Council in a candid assessment of the current situation. Capitulate under the blows of the external pressure is not a good definition of a "stabilizer anchorage".
The euro would collapse and the ECB would lose its credibility as a Central Bank.
In addition, the Chief Economist of the ECB, Otmar Issing, provides that long-term interest rates will go up rather than down, since inflation expectations are on the rise.
Thus, the reduction of interest rates would not be only an error, this would be particularly foolish.
But the ECB will not reduce its rates, although it argues that it would be possible to hold the political wolves at distance.
The ECB continues, and in doing so, it proves to Europeans that there is at least one European institution in which they have confidence.
This is extremely important.
History shows that political unrest lead to inflation that in turn feeds more and more political unrest.
Europeans can bet their last euro on ECB: she won't let not his young common currency be ravage by inflation because political leaders have failed in their task that now fear losing their charge.
Indeed, the courage shown by currently the ECB while remaining faithful to its principles should serve as a model for future European politicians.
When they understand that it cannot force the ECB to unnecessary interest rate declines and destructive, European leaders will then may be the courage to govern, which, after all, is the reason for which they were elected.
The rush to the succession of Arafat.
To understand how the Palestinian cause without Yasser Arafat will look, consider the various titles that he currently holds.
Arafat is Chairman of the Executive Committee of the PLO, president of the Palestinian national authority, Commander-in-Chief of the forces Palestinian and leader of the Fatah movement.
The PLO embodies Palestinian national aspirations to independence and the desire to become a State.
It is the body politic as high for all Palestinians, both for those who live in Palestine as refugees and other Palestinians in the diaspora.
The successor to Arafat will have to juggle between negotiations with Israel, which will require concessions on the "right of return" of refugees in Palestine, and aspirations over three million Palestinians who wish to return to homes where they were expelled during the 1948 and 1967 wars.
The successor of Arafat to the Palestinian national authority chairmanship will be bound by the Oslo Accords, which created an interim Government, currently led by Prime Minister Ahmad Qurei, who is responsible for the daily lives of the Palestinians living in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
The Palestinians will have to decide if the president of the PNA will occupy a position solid or merely symbolic, as is currently the case.
The second option would make Qurei a Prime Minister empowered, want many Palestinians and many others.
The position of the Commander of the Palestinian forces place soi - saying the various military units, security and Palestinian information into the hands of a single leader, which is supposed to enforce the law.
But these forces are now in disarray, the majority of the Palestinian security bodies in uniform to be reorganized after four years of intensive efforts by Israel to crush them.
The major factor of internal security is local paramilitary units.
These units, which most are not controlled by the central leadership of the PNA, are more loyal to the leadership of the base to uniformed PNA officers.
Local leaders of Fatah as Marwan Barghouti have tremendous power over the nationalist armed units that are loosely organized under the title of Al Aqsa martyrs Brigades.
Barghouti advocated and attempted to implement internal Fatah elections when the Israelis arrested him.
As a street leader elected to the Presidency of the Council of students from Bir Zeit University, he gained legitimacy in being chosen by his peers.
When the trial of Oslo began, he refused to accept any official position within the Palestinian Authority, choosing instead to remain close to the local Fatah cadres.
Who will take the place of Arafat shall ensure that these brigades are convinced that their status, their requirements and their leaders are respected.
Indeed, the struggle for power that will ensue in the era post - Arafat focuses ultimately on the Al Fatah, the backbone of the PLO.
A World Assembly will choose the Revolutionary Council of Fatah, which is composed of 100 members and which will elect to turn a central Committee of 20 members, in which will concentrate the major part of the struggle for power.
Many young street leaders will insist on an emergency meeting of the Revolutionary Council, or even the holding of the sixth General Assembly (which will be the first since 1988).
The events of the past months show that the Al Asqa martyrs Brigades have forced even Arafat to take their requirements into account.
Whereas the major part of the struggle for power will take place in the nationalist camp, should however not forget the Islamist camp led by Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
Although it is unlikely that the Islamists will meddle in the post - Arafat power struggle, they won't react if the new leader starts in the wrong direction.
Of course, the new leader will have to reach an agreement with the Islamists as the rules of the game, both on the national territory vis - Ã  - vis of Israel.
Without this agreement and if the new leader is harshly against the Islamists, a violent civil war could break out.
More importantly, in order to consolidate its supremacy, the next Palestinian leader must take difficult steps and show concrete results very quickly.
The experience of the first Palestinian Prime Minister, who resigned in large part because of his inability to make improvements to his people (especially Security personal and collective, of respect for the law and the end of chaos prevailing in certain Palestinian areas), remains fresh in the memory of the population.
At the same time, the freeze of the settlement activities, the release of Palestinian political prisoners, including Marwan Barghouti, and the removal of the hundreds of checkpoints between Palestinian cities ranimeraient a sense of hope, without which no Palestinian leader can negotiate what the world wants: a peace agreement.
The problem is that no Palestinian leader, whatever it is, cannot make these changes.
They represent a direct challenge to the Israeli occupiers, neighbouring Arab countries and the international community, led by the States - United.
The Moscow mystery of 2008.
Usually at this time, people are obsessed with what will bring the new year.
In Russia, the real uncertainty concerns 2008, not 2007.
Indeed, one can now reduce Russian policy to a single subject: the president Vladimir Poutine it will remain President after 2008, despite his repeated assertions that this will not be the case?
And if he gives way, which he formed to succeed him?
His heir apparent it will be for one of the factions of the Kremlin?
Or he will choose a "foreign"?
At least that Putin retains its position of final arbiter and decision maker of the country, there is great risk that a fierce power struggle is raging.
In an environment where power and property are inseparable and all governmental institutions emasculated, a transfer of supreme authority can lead to violent redistribution.
Resolving these issues is therefore vital for the Russian political elites anxious to preserve their current benefits and save others.
With regard to the public, the vast majority appears resigned to accept any solution arranged by the power.
Some 45% of Russians believe that Putin will appoint his successor, and that this person will become the new president.
Nearly a quarter believe that the constitution will be amended so that Putin can do a third term.
In one sense either, it is almost universally acknowledged that the transfer of universal authority is arranged at the Summit and endorsed by the polls.
The balance of forces in the legislature will be, too, determined by the Kremlin.
Over the past years, the configuration of the political parties and elections Act have changed repeatedly in order to adapt to the interests of the ruling elite.
As a result, adverse forces have no chance in next December's parliamentary election.
Foreign policy, ordinary Russians are indifferent to anything that does not directly affect, and are asking accounts to anyone.
They were not disturbed by the recent murder of journalist Anna PolitkovskaÃ¯a, by the murder of Andrei Kozlov, vice president of the Central Bank, or by the implications of the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko (a majority of people questioned in a poll said that he had been killed by his "business partners".).
This alienation between the State and the people has a long tradition in Russia, just as the public apathy.
But these days - ci, apathy is consolidated by improving the standard of living.
Thanks to the windfall of oil and gas, the Russians live better that they have never lived in the Communist era.
In addition, we can say that history has never seen such a large proportion of Russians enjoying a decent standard of living.
As a result, people have become even more docile face an increasingly autocratic Government.
Of course, there are many reasons to complain, and people grumble, but they will not unite to oppose the status quo.
The marginal political groups and personalities who are organizing a protest themselves facing official pressure, and even harassment, what constitutes new reasons to ensure that the public turns their back.
As the result of the elections is played in advance, it may be that many go simply not vote.
In fact, the Russia of today has virtually no reason to gather active support.
On the contrary, public participation is considered to be an obstacle to the objectives pursued by the bureaucracy: its own perpetuation and a still wider control of the lucrative property.
If members of the Russian elite have never fed modernizing ambitions, they abandoned them, because without public participation, modernization is an illusion.
Instead, the Kremlin relies more and more on the conservative electorate, of Soviet-style, as its power base, while away more advances, entrepreneurs and better trained.
Stephen Jennings, Chairman of the Board of Renaissance Capital, an investment group that has a decade of experience in Russia, recently noted "contradictory trends" of the country: the emergence of a "middle class booming" beside a "highly centralized government, raising a new class of oligarchs of State and bureaucracy to the fast growth".
The problem is that the best and the brightest elements of Russia, which Jennings rents "major management capabilities, professionalism, productivity and social and economic ambition" have no air considered to concern their distance from decision-making policy.
They may regret the Kremlin's economic policies, but they thrive of the rampant corruption of the Russia and its shameful ranking in competitiveness indices, just as they accommodate the general erosion of democracy, manipulation of the judicial system and the weak enforcement of the law.
Like their less advanced compatriots, they do not seek to hold accountable to the Government or to demand changes.
For now, life is beautiful enough as it is.
Therefore, if the transition smooth 2008 is threatened, or if there is a risk of destabilisation, its origin cannot be found in infighting at the top, and not in public.
Optimists hope that one day the Russian middle class growing will take responsibility for the future of the Russia and ask a radical improvement in the way of governing.
But that will trigger the transition from passive docility to active public participation?
If a prosperous time brings political apathy and bad policies lead to a socio-economic decline, the Russian elements the best and the brightest could end up second to populist forces.
Fight against drugs: we need to change policy.
Once more, the Russia and the Ukraine are victims of an illusion.
Since the end of communism in 1991, the use of drugs has increased dramatically in both countries (as well as many others).
They reacted by draconian measures in line with the simplistic policy aimed at the total elimination of drugs adopted by the United Nations.
These measures contribute today to the explosion of AIDS in a number of developing countries.
The UN conventions that govern the policy of combating drugs at the international level do not take account of recent discoveries on the drug use and dependence.
Most of these conventions have been established long before the advent of AIDS, which is spread mainly by intravenous drug use in the countries of the former Soviet Union and in many Asian countries.
Thus, at the international level, it is in Russia and Ukraine that AIDS is spreading more quickly.
The number of people infected there was multiplied by 18 over the past five years.
It is estimated that one and a half million Russians and 400,000 Ukrainians are affected and at least 85% of them are intravenous drug users.
In an attempt to wrongheaded to adhere to the UN conventions, the Russian and Ukrainian governments use the bulk of their means of combating drugs.
Drug users are victims of ill-treatment on the part of the police and are resisted by health services, even for vital care.
And meanwhile, drugs continue to flood the market.
On drugs, the repression has never managed to eliminate demand.
Repression takes into account economic and social factors nor public health considerations related to the use of banned substances.
Locking up drug users is not a solution; in Russia it is still easier to buy drugs in prison than outside.
In a repressive climate, drug users who escape arrest tend to be the subject of discrimination, which do not encourage them to protect their health or that of the people they are encountering.
If the company offers no hope for addicts and showed no compassion towards them, drug addiction and HIV AIDS cannot that grow quickly.
The Russia and the Ukraine are not only cope with the increase in intravenous drug abuse and the spread of AIDS which accompanies it.
If they continue this kind of policy, Pakistan, the Iran, China, Central Asian countries and all the countries that are in the same situation will be confronted with the same catastrophe in terms of public health.
Many studies around the world show that in the fight against drugs, the action in the field of public health is the most effective for reducing HIV infection and reduce the costs.
The British medical journal Lancet estimated that the USA would have saved at least $ 500 million if they had implemented a needle exchange programme at the national level during the period 1987-1995.
A survey conducted at the international level shows that HIV infection decreased by 5.8% in the cities where there is a needle-exchange program, but it increased by 5.9% in the cities where there's not.
No importance study highlights a correlation between the existence of a needle exchange program and an increase in drug abuse.
Business studies in the USA, Australia and elsewhere show that the number of drug addicts who receive treatment does not decrease, if because participants in needle exchange programs have easier access.
The UN agencies such as the Commission on drugs or the United Nations Office on drugs and crime (UNODC, ex - UNDCP) do not have mandate to prescribe a specific strategy to combat drugs.
However, their narrow conception of the fight against the drug exerts a strong influence on the policies and measures taken by Member States.
Many Governments, obsessed with compliance with the UN conventions, cannot or do not want to take into account the negative effects in terms of public health of a strictly repressive policy of fight against drugs.
In the 1990s, when AIDS began to kill millions of people in Africa, infecting more than a quarter of the population of some countries, international institutions have hijacked head.
For similar reasons, this terrible epidemic is about to hit among other countries of the former Soviet Union.
Have - we learned anything?
It is not too late, policy makers at the national and international level can still reconsider their strategy.
Despite the UN conventions, some countries have adopted a more pragmatic attitude towards drugs and AIDS.
Consider that it is first and foremost a problem of public health to more effectively combat the AIDS epidemic.
The following measures would achieve:.
Â· Adopt legislation anti - discrimination to ensure civil liberties and of the human rights of users of drugs and people affected by HIV.
Â· Recognize that the use of drugs is a problem of public health and non-compliance with law or law enforcement and to implement a policy that reflects this fact.
Â· Explicitly legalize the programs of exchange of syringes and methadone treatments and other substitute products.
Â· Establish programs national risk reduction that are pragmatic and accessible to all. This requires education, alternative therapies, detoxification programs and needle exchanges.
Â· Both at the national and international level, involve drug users and their advocates in the development of policy concerning drugs.
Refuse to reconsider the goals of combating anti - drug and selected strategies will only worsen the AIDS epidemic and contribute to the death of millions of vulnerable people.
The abandonment of the Lisbon resolutions.
Upon taking office at the post of President of the European Commission, Durao Barroso - former Prime Minister of the Portugal - should concentrate urgently to restore order and to refocus the economic policies of the European Union.
The thickest folder that awaits him is that of Lisbon resolutions, an ambitious programme approved in 2000 by the heads of State and Government of the European Union with the aim of making the Union 'the most competitive and dynamic economy' as early as 2010.
The main economic fields are covered: innovation and entrepreneurship, the reform of social systems and social inclusion, skills and employment, equality of the sexes at work, the liberalization of employment and property markets, as well as sustainable development.
It is certain that these are worthy ambitions but that inherently belong to the sphere of national political decisions.
Indeed, according to the European treaties, the Union has no competence to implement a legislative and political arsenal in these areas, nor the power to enforce.
However, the Council of Europe, encouraged by the European Commission, has invented a new political approach - called 'open coordination' - to be able to affect these areas.
Open coordination involves the determination of common objectives at EU level, a voluntary compliance on the part of the Member States and internal control of the results within the Council of Europe.
Obviously, open coordination has failed to keep its promises.
In addition, the illusion that the Council of Europe could somehow sommer growth and productivity has provided a diversion to national politicians who do not want to promote at the national level of unpopular decisions.
Thus, I would suggest to Mr Barroso, as a first step, to get rid of the Lisbon resolutions.
It is the only thing to do to make it clear that national responsibilities remain in the hands of national politicians in terms of economic performance.
This brings me to the macroeconomic coordination at the level of the European Union.
The Maastricht Treaty envisaged a political framework for economic and monetary union.
Monetary policy was centralized and entrusted to an independent Central Bank, while fiscal policy remains the responsibility of the Member States.
National Governments were subject to the dual constraint - under the control of excessive deficits procedure - to prevent fiscal deficits of more than 3% of GDP and budget deficits more 60% of GDP (or at least around this value).
Subsequently, the stability and Growth Pact added an additional criterion, in the medium term, to ensure that national budgets are "balanced or almost".
This was, essentially, to prevent irresponsible budgetary policies after the launch of the euro, while leaving enough space for cyclical oscillations of the deficits within the limit of 3%.
The credibility of this arsenal of measures was greatly undermined by the public controversy of November 2003 between the Commission and the Ecofin Council on the application of the procedure of control of excessive budget deficits to the France and the Germany.
Which does not mean that it should be abandoned.
On the contrary, a common external constraint on fiscal behavior is necessary to serve as guard - crazy together against an accumulation of unsustainable public debt, which could affect financial stability and inflation throughout the European Union - a risk increased by the impact of aging populations on pension systems.
Such a constraint also provides an anchor for the national decision-making in Member States whose political systems are less reinforced.
But the system must be reviewed.
I will not listen those who defend the exclusion of investments fiscal deficits: this would only further encouragement for creative accounting and unsustainable accumulation of debt.
Instead, it should focus on the sustainability of the debt rather than on the annual deficits.
The debt criterion, for example, could be accompanied by a limitation on (trends of) the growth of the rate of public expenditure, which would be kept below the rate of nominal GDP.
The power of the Commission to launch the movement when there is risk of excessive deficits should be strengthened - until, of course, the Commission more never forgets that the monitoring of national policies is a task that requires a certain political meaning and cannot be left in the hands of managers and lawyers.
Finally, he should make European integration the main priority that the Union has at its disposal a powerful legal instrument to force open markets and strengthen competition.
The best therapy to revive growth must be both directly, through the increase in competitive pressure, indirect, by the outbreak of the measures necessary for the adaptation of national policies on employment, social protection and education.
This is a long-term task.
State subsidies for the benefit of companies in loss of speed remain ambiguous and the common laws designed to ensure the free movement of goods and services are not fully respected by the Member States - procurement and energy are the best examples.
In addition, most services markets - securities trade, the distribution of wholesale and retail, business services and local public services - remain sheltered from competition and regulatory free - exchange.
There is evidence that show that these distortions of the market for services that represents two-thirds of GDP are responsible for the bulk of the deficit of productivity that undergoes the EU vis - Ã  - vis States - United.
In recent years, the Council of Europe gave insufficient attention to these tasks, which involve a commitment to total and constant on the part of Member States to transpose and implement directives European.
All too often, the Commission has promoted the implementation of new legislation and the creation of new spending programs instead of the effective management of what is already in place.
Thus, Mr Barroso should forget the platitudes of top-flight Lisbon resolutions and focus instead on the effective implementation of the single market and put order in the fiscal policies of the Member States.
Let local governments assume responsibility for their country's economic performance.
The emotional clash of civilizations.
During the self - saying "war against terrorism", the concept of "clash of civilization" between Islam and the West has generally been excluded as politically incorrect and intellectually wrongheaded.
The most common interpretation of the place is that the world has entered a new era characterized by a conflict on the"inside" of a particular civilization, c'est - Ã  - dire l'Islam, with fundamentalist Muslims as war against the moderates against the West.
The strategic conclusion derived from such an analysis was clear, ambitious and easily summarized: democratization.
If the problem was the lack of democracy in the Islamic world, bring democracy in the "Great" Middle - East would be the solution, and it was the historic duty of States - United as a nation the most powerful and moral, to make this necessary change.
The status quo was untenable.
Put democracy in place, with or without regime change, was the only alternative to chaos and the rise of fundamentalism.
Today the Iraq is may be on the brink civil war between Shiites and Sunnis.
Iran, ruled by a new and more radical president moves irresistibly towards obtaining a nuclear capability.
A free electoral process brought Hamas to power in Palestine, and the unfortunate episode of Danish newspaper cartoons illustrated the almost combustible nature of relations between Islam and the West.
All these developments pave the way to new interpretations.
Rather than a "clash of civilizations", we could be faced with many levels of conflict, which interact with one another so that they increase global instability.
Indeed, it appears that the world is witness to a triple conflict.
There is a divide within Islam, that if violence in Iraq spreads to neighbouring countries, could cause regional destabilization.
There is also a shock that should not be considered to be between Islam and the West, but between the secular world and a growing religious world.
At a deeper and atavistic level, there is an emotional conflict between a culture of fear and a culture of humiliation.
It would be a gross simplification that mentioned, as some do, a clash between civilization and barbarism.
In fact, we are facing a ditch that does that expand on the role of religion, and which extends between the West (with the States - United in the role of the complex exception) and most of the rest of the world (the most notable exception being China), especially the Islamic world.
The gap reflects how religion defines the identity of an individual within a society.
At a time when religion is becoming more and more important elsewhere, we Europeans have largely forgotten our (violent and intolerant) religious past, and have difficulty understanding the role that religion can play in the daily lives of others.
In some aspects, "they" are our own buried past and, in an association of ignorance, prejudice and by top - everything from fear, "" we fear qu 'they' can define our future.
We live in a secular world, where freedom of expression can easily turn into a mockery insensitive and irresponsible, while others see religion as their supreme goal, if it is their last hope.
They have tried everything, from nationalism to regionalism, from communism to capitalism.
Since everything has failed, why not try God?
Globalization may not - be not created these levels of conflict, but it accentuated them by making the differences more visible and more tangible.
In our globalized age, we have lost the privilege, and paradoxically, the virtue, the ignorance.
We all see how others feel and react, but without the historical and cultural basic tools to decipher these reactions.
Globalization has made the bed of a world dominated by the dictatorship of emotion and ignorance.
This emotional shock is exacerbated in the case of Islam.
In the Arab world, in particular, Islam is dominated by a culture of humiliation felt by the peoples and nations that consider themselves the main losers, the worst victims, a new and unjust international system.
From this point of view, the Israeli - Palestinian conflict is exemplary.
It became an obsession.
It is not as long as Arabs and Muslims are concerned really about the Palestinians.
On the contrary, the Islamic world left the Palestinian without real support for decades.
In reality, for them the conflict has come to symbolise the perpetuation of anachronistic an unfair colonial order, to represent their political malaise, and embody the impossibility that they perceive to be masters of their own destiny.
In the eyes of the Arabs (and some other Muslims), the strength and resilience of Israel is a direct consequence of their own weakness, their divisions and their corruption.
The majority of the Arabs can not to support al - Qaida, but they are not opposed with all their heart.
Instead, there is the temptation to regard Osama bin Laden as a sort of Robin Hood violent, which officially unforgivable acts helped them to recover a sense of pride and the Arab dignity.
This is, perhaps, that is the real clash of civilizations: in the emotional conflict between the culture of European fear and humiliation Muslim, and most particularly Arabic culture.
It would be dangerous to sub - estimate the depth of a broad emotional gap, and recognize its existence is the first step to overcome.
But it will be difficult, as transcending the emotional clash of civilizations presupposes one opening to 'the other' that none of the two camps is may be willing to consider.
Globalization and anti - Americanism.
The anti - US feelings grow all over the world.
American Democrats say that president Bush's policies have degraded the attractiveness of America.
Republicans respond that America is doomed to be poorly loved because of its size and its association with globalization.
According to them, the anti - Americanism will persist because some perceive America as a cultural threat.
For my part, I think that these positions lack historical perspective.
Contrary to popular opinion, globalization is not a factor of homogenization and Americanization of world cultures.
Although the States - United are at the forefront of the current information revolution, that allows to develop similarities of cultural and social behaviors (such as listening to the television or Internet use) that are attributed to Americanization, although the correlation is not causation.
To understand why, imagine a country that would introduce Informatics and communications with speed in a world where America would not exist.
Be expected anyway to change cultural and social importance of the fact of such modernization.
Well sure, because of the existence of the States - United their presence at the vanguard of the revolution in ICTs, there is a degree of Americanization, which will probably decrease during the twenty - and - first century thanks to technological penetration and the modernisation of local cultures at their own pace.
The historical evidence that globalization does not necessarily imply homogenization is located in Japan, a country that is is deliberately the rest isolated from the world when the first waves of globalization.
In the middle of the ten a le milieu de le dix-- ninth century, the Japan became the first Asian country to host the globalization and to borrow successfully to the rest of the world without losing its uniqueness.
When restoring Meiji, the Japan has searched everywhere tools and innovations that would allow it to become a leading power rather than a victim of Western imperialism.
He sent his youth studying in Western societies.
Its delegations have toured the world looking for scientific, technological and industrial innovations.
In the political field, Meiji reformers were very aware of the philosophy and American institutions, yet they chose to turn the German model that were more appropriate to a country headed by an emperor.
The lesson that the Japan gives to the rest of the world is not just the fact that an Asian country can be competitive, but only after a century and a half of globalization, it remains possible to adapt while preserving a unique culture.
Above all, the image of an America as of homogenization wrongly reflects a static vision of cultures.
Efforts to show local cultures as unchanging often reflect reactionary political strategies rather than a description of reality.
As the Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa said, those who defend cultural identities against globalisation betray an attitude inhibited towards culture perceived out any historical component.
Have - us knowledge of a culture that would have remained unchanged through time?
Find such cultures, to go to the meeting of small primitive, magico - religious communities, populated by people who... because of their primitive condition, are always more vulnerable to exploitation and extermination.
Fertilized crops are in constant transition, borrowing from other cultures without that these loans are always made to the States - United.
Thus, a large number of countries have turned to Canada rather than States - United as an example for their own constitution in the years that followed the end of the cold war.
Globalization is also a double-edged sword.
In some areas, not only affected is felt against US cultural imports, but some efforts are also being made to change American culture it - even.
A majority of Americans are probably agree with capital punishment of our days, but the death penalty is considered a flagrant violation of the rights of man everywhere in Europe, in fact, almost anywhere in the world.
The American positions on the environment and climate change or GMOs raise the same criticisms.
More subtly, the opening of America facing immigration enriches as it transformed American culture.
Finally, globalization and the information revolution may reinforce rather than reduce cultural diversity.
Some french commentators express their fear facing the world of the world of Internet marketing that would leave no room to a culture attached to hundreds of different cheese varieties.
On the contrary, Internet allows dispersed consumers together to encourage the market niche, and even to hundreds of Web sites devoted exclusively to cheese.
Internet also allows people to establish political communities sets more various.
The use of Welsh in Great - Britain or Gaelic in Ireland is more important today than it was there a half - century.
The Great - Britain, the Belgium and Spain, among other countries of Europe, gave more great powers to the regions and local elected representatives.
The age of global information could well strengthen rather than weaken local cultures.
Economic and social globalization produces superficial similarities at the level of the logos of T - shirt or brands of soft drinks, but it will always remain a great cultural diversity underlying.
American culture dominates the world today, and it contributes to the attractiveness of America, it is its soft power, in many areas, but not in all areas.
At the same time, immigrants, ideas and events outside US borders are changing American culture within the borders of the States - United.
As globalization develops technological capabilities, information technology we allow participation extended to global communications and the domination of the economy and of American culture could very well weaken.
Less than domination could well mean a little less anxiety vis - Ã  - vis of Americanization, fewer protests against American arrogance and a lesser intensity in the backlash of anti - Americanism.
Will be United States - can - be less control in the future, but may be to live in a world more consistent with its fundamental principles of democracy, free enterprise, individual freedoms and human rights.
Why America must rejoin the world.
The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 on New York and Washington have deeply changed States - United by moving the priorities on the foreign policy agenda.
The new strategy of national security of the Bush administration, developed in September 2002, identifies the combination of terrorism, rogue States and weapons of mass destruction as the first threat to America.
Most citizens agree with the new direction taken by American foreign policy, but challenged the methodology.
The threat is - it so great that America must act alone or the States - United must - they act only with the support of international institutions, even if this bride country?
The events in Iraq demonstrate this debate, but it takes its source in deeper causes.
During his presidential campaign in 2000, George W. Bush told America: "If we are an arrogant nation, they consider us as well, but if we're a humble nation, they will respect us".
He was right, but unfortunately, too many friends of America saw his administration, during the first eight months after his election, be concerned with arrogance of America limited interests centered on military power as no case of treaties, standards and multilateralism.
The peremptory announcement of administration stating that the Kyoto Protocol on global climate change was "dead" resulted in a reaction of other countries which cost the States - United their seat on the the UN Human Rights Commission.
September 11 itself--saying changed all this.
Congress has finally paid off the debts owed by America to the United Nations and the president has concentrated its efforts on the establishment of a coalition against terrorism.
But the rapid success of the war in Afghanistan led some members of the administration and some commentators to conclude that the proper functioning of unilateralism. The columnist Charles Krauthammer, for example, advocates a "new unilateralism" where America refuses to play the role of the "docile international citizen" and its own objectives without qualms.
The new Unilateralists make a mistake in focusing too heavily on military power alone.
It is true that the military might of America, backed by an equivalent to the combined budget of the eight most powerful countries after States - United, is essential to global stability, and plays a major role in the response to terrorism.
But the metaphor of war should not blind us to the fact that the suppression of terrorism will require years of patient civil cooperation not spectacular with other countries in such areas as information-sharing, police work, the traceability of financial flows and cooperation between customs.
Military success in Afghanistan has solved the easiest part of the problem.
The Al Qaeda retains cells in some 15 countries.
Rather than demonstrate the point of view of the Unilateralists, partial success in Afghanistan demonstrates the continuing need for cooperation.
Similarly, it was much easier to win the war in Iraq to win the peace.
The problem for Americans in the 21st century lies in the fact that many more than ever of problems and forces beyond the control even of the most powerful State. The attacks of September 11 demonstrated that the revolution and the globalization of information have changed world politics so that the Americans can not reach all their international goals acting alone.
States - United missing prerequisites international and national necessary to resolve conflicts to other companies and to monitor and control transnational transactions that threaten Americans in their country.
In several of the current major problems, such as international financial stability, drug smuggling, the spread of diseases or global climate change military power is ineffective.
Indeed, its appeal may go against the goal.
America must instead mobilize international coalitions to address these threats and common challenges.
The desire for cooperation from other countries depends in part on their own personal interest, but also the attractiveness of American positions.
This power of attraction is what I call the 'soft power'.
This means that other countries want to what you want and that the need to use the carrot and the stick to get others to do what you want is less present.
Hard power is derived from the military and a country's economic power.
Soft power is the product of the attraction represented by the culture, ideals and policies of a country.
Hard power will be always essential, but soft power will take more and more importance in the treatment of transnational issues whose resolution requires multilateral cooperation.
It is certain that no large country can afford to be strictly multilateralist and the States - United must sometimes take the lead of other countries, as was the case in Afghanistan.
But in Iraq, president Bush should follow the example of his father and establish a broad international coalition.
Now, while his administration returns to the United Nations to seek a new resolution that will allow other countries to provide troops and resources for the peacekeeping and reconstruction in Iraq, he pays the price of its method of entry into war.
Okay, multilateralism can be used by smaller States to restrict the freedom of action of America, but this does not mean that it does not, as a general rule, in the interest of America.
By integrating U.S. policies in multilateral structures, States - United can make their disproportionate power more legitimate and acceptable.
Even the well-meaning Americans are not immune to the famous warning from Lord Acton who said that power tends to corrupt.
Learn to listen to others and to define US interests more broadly in order to include global interests will be crucial to American soft power, as well as the vision that will have the rest of their preponderance (beneficial or not).
The paradox of power American is that the power the more importance since Rome cannot achieve many of its unilateral objectives in the global information age.
America needs to pay greater attention to the soft power and multilateral cooperation.
This is the real lesson of September 11.
Socialism or global division?
For the first time in our history, we have the knowledge, technology and wealth required for the design of a different world.
We have the means to "return the poverty in the dustbin of history" (Make Poverty History).
Although we have the power to change the world, we do not take the measures that are needed.
In 2000, many Governments in the world have adopted under the aegis of the United Nations Millennium development goals, aimed at halving poverty by the year 2015.
The international community does however not display the necessary political will to meet these responsibilities of base to humanity, resulting in a loss of confidence in politics in populations.
If we do nothing, our citizens will lose hope in the power of democracy and take refuge in extremism, fundamentalism and violence.
To restore the trust of the people not only in politics but also in their own potential, our policies must guarantee responsible governance and institutions working in a responsible manner in the interest of the citizens.
As such, the Socialist International, the largest political organization in the world, can unite the citizens of the world around a new global programme to achieve these objectives.
Our first challenge is to democratize globalization.
We must redefine globalization from the base and include two-thirds of humanity which are currently excluded from the process, in terms which reflect the socialist principles of inclusion, cultural diversity and sustainable development.
How is - it possible to engage citizens in a democratic manner to economic when the IMF and the World Bank are working according to the principle of "one dollar, one vote"?
Democracy cannot flourish truly in a world where capital and power are heavily concentrated in the hands of few, when the multinationals questioned the power of democratically elected representatives when organized crime can afford to buy the police, justice and the politicians when the monopolisation of the media erodes fundamental freedoms.
The democratization of globalization will take time.
However, we can accelerate the process by strengthening regional cooperation and integration.
This calls for the creation of new channels of cooperation with progressive forces in other parts of the world, in China, in the States - United, in India and in the Arab world.
To meet global challenges, we must strengthen and democratize international institutions, including the United Nations.
We must however go beyond the reform of the Security Council and start creating a democratic global architecture to put globalisation at the service of citizens and markets.
Today, the main priority of the Socialists is to redress the balance between economic efficiency and social justice.
While we benefit from successful precedents, including the Nordic model, it remains difficult to achieve this balance for some countries.
Capitalist markets yielding way to extensive trade networks and market turning into companies of market economies, Governments and unions are still more restricted in their freedom of action.
This has paralyzed and divided our citizens.
Citizens of developed countries feel increasingly objectified by consumerism while the citizens of developing countries struggle daily to survive.
In both cases, but in a different way, people feel impoverished.
It is certain that we belong to different companies, but we also face new forms of inequality.
The lack of labour in certain regions of the world standards undermines the welfare of workers in other parts of the world.
Migration of the masses of poor countries has stirred up feelings of fear and xenophobia in rich countries, particularly in the working class.
Similarly, free trade referred back to back farmers and tertiary sector employees of the developed and developing.
Environmental issues have become the bed of the great game of blame.
Developed countries fear the depletion of vital resources if they are shared with developing countries, which, in turn, accuse the rich countries to destroy the environment in their race for profits.
To bridge these divisions, we need to rethink the nature of jobs in this global economy increasingly automated, seamless and mobile.
The capital is globalizing, core labour standards must also become globalized.
Forced labour and the working children, as well as discrimination in employment, should be deleted.
We also need to democratize our own policies.
We must fight against exclusion in our political parties just as we fight exclusion in our societies.
This implies to welcome immigrants and minorities, create greater opportunities for women and persons with disabilities, empowering citizens through education and participation.
Empowering citizens means giving them the power to decide and the ability to decide in full knowledge of the cause.
In PASOK, the Greek Socialist Party that I lead, we undertook ambitious reforms in this direction.
It is the same within the Socialist International, which seeks to create a world governed not by free markets but by free peoples.
The Indian tortoise and the Chinese Hare.
"The India is everywhere": was this year's World Economic Forum theme.
In the Western world, great importance is given to the achievements of China so that those of the India come to mind that after the fact.
For good stress that political stability must triumph over the long term, the Indians have covered all Swiss bus banner "India, the world's fastest emerging democracy.".
The Indian media blitz was a monumental success.
In Davos, all speakers have taken up the idea that even if China is currently holding the rope, in the long term, the race between the two Asian giants will play heads or tails.
Everything at least for a few days, the emergence of India as a superpower, compared to China, was a fait accompli.
But what is - it actually of the race between these two economies that are each more than a billion people?
In appearance, the China has a comfortable ahead of the India.
Twenty-five years ago, at the dawn of the current movement of globalization, Indian and Chinese national productions were approximately identical.
Now, regardless of the economic indicators, China is twice as rich as the India.
However, the real difference is not so much to the fact that the best Chinese are better than the best Indian.
The Indian elite is made up of champions. Bold offer of $ 22 billion proposed by Lakshmi Mittal to buy the french steelmaker Arcelor shows actually.
The real difference â whether we admit it or not - is that the Chinese Communist Government has managed to globalize a larger share of the population that the Indian democratic Government is able to do so.
However, it is impossible to say that resources are equitably distributed in China.
It is only along the coast, where roughly a third of the population Chinese, people seem to really be retracted into the 21st century.
The bulk of rural China is still very poor and 150 million rural Chinese have no employment. In campaigns, health and education are often centuries.
Nevertheless, the figures of exclusion due to the caste system are even worse in India.
It could be that only one in five took advantage of the globalized economy.
For an employee in call centers, there are countless Indians who do that eke.
While some 450 million Chinese participate in the globalization of the economy, only 200 to 250 million Indians benefit.
More than anything else, it is this difference that separates the two economies.
What can the India to bridge this gap?
Its biggest flaw is the lack of roads, bridges, ports and other infrastructure. At this level, the contrast with China is striking.
If Indian products have access to the global market, how could the India - she conquer?
Over the past five years, China has multiplied by five its road infrastructure.
Its 50,000 kilometers of new roads were built to accommodate large aircraft, what is incommensurate with some tracks of landing of Indian airports.
This is not just a matter of money: the cash flows down to the Indian Central Bank which has mainly invested in foreign low-yielding Treasury bills.
The real problem is that China's authoritarian system meets no real opposition when it decides to raze a shanty town which lies on the route of a new airport.
The Indian Government, however, has neither the power nor the will to walk on the poor people to further enrich the rich.
Unfortunately, without infrastructure, the 800 million Indians who have not yet succeeded in life are unlikely to achieve.
The India will never be able to create enough jobs in the services sector, it must become competitive also in the manufacture of low-end products.
Without a better infrastructure network, the majority of the Indians will remain excluded from globalization.
Thus, the Indian economy could - she one day succeed to exceed the incorrigible romanticism of the Chinese?
Not necessarily. The areas in which the India excels, the services mainly, offer potentially higher than industrial production margins.
On this point, the Chinese, handicapped by a much lower legal system, will struggle to be competitive.
Western companies have more confidence for the Indian companies, for sensitive financial data or patents, than they do to China.
Foreign companies know that if they outsource their processes of high technology in China, they may as well directly publish their projects on the web.
The India also has a financial system much more developed China, asset of more and more importance as and when these two economies are evolving.
Control and the control of Finance (loans led, such as economists call them) are effective when it comes to building bridges. They are much less when it is necessary to select firms that deserve to be saved.
The challenge for the Indians as well as for other emerging economies (the Brazil, the Russia and the Mexico) is to find new methods to boost their economic sectors that work without strangling them.
If the India catch up with China, it should include a greater number of its citizens in the process of globalization by offering better education, better health facilities and a larger network of infrastructures.
It is only at this price that "the India may be everywhere".
The G8 in the land of black gold.
Poor Russia, if oil-rich.
Its so hard to find its place in the elite group of eight countries taken seriously.
President Vladimir Putin, that hope may be raising the debate at the presidential summit in PÃ©tersbourg of July, has simmered an ambitious program.
He plans to engage his colleagues in erudite conversations about education, infectious diseases, and to be sure that person asleep, 'energy security'.
And that the efforts of Putin earned him - they?
Not - much.
The Bush administration, represented by the vice - president Dick Cheney (but with the explicit approval of the boss) recently accused Russia of falling back into its old idiosyncrasies "of the evil empire".
Putin responded by calling the United States of "Comrade Wolf" ready to pounce on any nation showing signs of weakness.
How Bush and Putin will - they greet the meeting of PÃ©tersbourg? The suspense remains intact.
The Europeans, meanwhile, are always at the edge of nerves, so great is their fear of being trapped by the gas dispute between the Russia and the Ukraine which has dried up their pipelines for a few days at the beginning of the year again.
To them, talk about "energy security" with the Russia returns to discuss the safety of water with comrade crocodile.
Obviously, if you want to be nasty we can always point out the absurdity of the belonging of the Russia a club that includes the giant economies of the States - United, the Germany, the Japan, England, the France, the Italy and (to a lesser extent) the Canada.
Why Chinese president Hu Jintao, whose country has the second largest world economy (measured on the basis of world prices), does - not awarded Putin place around the table?
After all, even with all its energy resources, and despite the current high prices of gas and oil, the national product of the Russia is little more than that of greater Los Angeles.
May - should be Putin - he stop cashing all these criticisms and go on the offensive.
It could begin by pointing out his Democratic counterparts so sufficient that it is probably more popular in Russia than none of them in his own country.
In fact, it could probably honestly win an election tomorrow (no risk that he knows one day however).
There are few leaders who could without laughing say as much.
Obviously, the success of Putin in recent years in eliminating anything resembling closely or from afar at a free press (and when a former KGB "eliminates" the free press is not only a figure of speech) helped silence any open opposition.
However, this does not prevent Putin enjoy a real popularity to an audience seeking a leader capable of securing the country without to sink.
Putin can also argued that his country's fiscal position is much stronger than that of the other members of the G8.
Certainly, the fact that Siberia proved be a giant oil wells that the Government absorbs the largest part of revenues has been very useful.
The Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez is also trying to balance the books of accounts of his country, for the time being.
But to be honest, the oil is not everything.
Most economists recommend rich countries to replace their old tax codes, complicated by a simple, low, flat tax, and deplore the fact that if few countries have it tried.
Putin, he has implemented this style of politics a few years ago, and the results have any miracle.
Naturally, it is possible that the other G8 leaders are less excited by certain Russian practices in the field of budgetary problems.
Most of the G8 countries seem unable to achieve the political consensus needed to take the measures which are needed, as the increase in the retirement age or the significant reduction in the allocations on the inflation indexing.
Russia, she practically abandoned its pensioners after increasing the amount of their income.
In fact, many Russian elderly are forced for their livelihood to grow potatoes on tiny plots of land that the Government allows them to cultivate.
It is - to - say, if they survive: since the fall of the Berlin wall, the life expectancy for men has fallen from 65 to 60 years.
It seems that the stress of the transition is the first cause of mortality, before even the major killers of the Russia post - Communist as alcohol, crime and AIDS.
Putin must - he told his colleagues that they could also balance the intergenerational account of their country by starving the older?
In fact, Putin would probably well-advised not to insist on the successes of his country.
May - be worth - he better leave the vodka flowing afloat and hope pretty smiles on the family photo.
Be that as it may, when Putin will announce to his guests that they must more pay the Russia to increase their own "energy security", it will end may be by getting the respect in which it sucks so hard.
The economy of fear.
The world economy appears to walk on water, getting rid of a shrug of the shoulders of the increase in the price of oil, the political paralysis in Europe, the - United States and record housing prices unsustainable deficit.
Could this be because, as would have us believe the G8 leaders, investors are optimistic, confident in the direction given to the world economy by their leaders?
Or are - we governed by a pathology of fear, nourished by certain events, such as the recent attacks on terrorists in London, which maintains interest rates long term at a low level, thus hiding a whole of latent problems?
The role of interest rates in the long term, extremely low (after adjustment for inflation), which hides a multitude of weaknesses in the world economy, is only too apparent.
The rise of the price of real estate around the world supports the demand in many countries, and, according to a recent study by the International Monetary Fund, the continuing decline in interest rates explain two - thirds or more of the international rise of prices.
Europe benefited less, but his savings to would be much more evil if long-term interest rates returned to their average of 25 years ago.
Similarly, Latin America experienced a certain boom in recent years, despite the weight of debt and reform policy mixed.
Low long-term interest rates have enabled the region to manage its debt, while demand has helped raise the price of exports of commodities in the region.
Why soaring oil prices did not put it in knee the world economy, as was so often the case in the past?
Once more, the answer lies in low interest rates.
Usually, a sudden outbreak of the oil prices quickly translates into expectations of high inflation, followed by the rise of the rate of interest on all due dates.
This time - ci yet the Federal Reserve continues to raise its lending rates in the short term to control inflation and long-term interest rates, which are much more important, has declined, as if by magic.
Indeed, America is the single and most important beneficiary of this situation of low interest rates, where everyone borrows money as if soon there are more nowhere.
Property owners, supported by the rise of real estate prices, accumulated debts.
The federal Government has thrown out the window any fiscal prudence.
The country as a whole absorbs incredible manner the three - quarters of global savings.
But, as long as interest rates remain low and growth high, Americans can laugh at those who predict that their excess plant the fruits of their ruin.
But if low long-term interest rates help both economies to walk on water, why rates are - they so low and this situation will persist?
The situation may be much more fragile that many politicians would have us believe.
People feel may be less and not more, safe about their future in the long term, either because they fear terrorism, a global pandemic or a set of severe financial crises.
I'm not saying that investors are hysterical, but simply that they have become a little more concerned about long-term prospects.
Therefore, they throw themselves on the shares and debt securities which they perceive, rightly or wrongly as safe.
We lack other convincing explanations.
There is no doubt that emerging markets have embarked on an unusual savings, reforming their reserves and improving their budgetary balances, but nobody expects that this will continue indefinitely.
Even the Director of the Reserve Federal American, Alan Greenspan, the oracle of Delphi on interest rates, said about the current situation is an "Enigma".
History suggests that the technology boom has not completely finished its role, and with all the productivity gains Americans willing to irradiate the world, raising growth rates.
Usually a rapid global growth translates into interest rates to increase in the long term, at least, of course, to the bottom of them, people became worried.
Suppose that investors are concerned about the possibilities of disaster within five to ten years.
(According to experts of nuclear terrorism and pandemics, the risk is real.).
Suppose that investors think that growth will probably continue to remain strong, but that can - be - simply can - be - the situation will fall apart.
In this case, it SetPoint quite possible to coexist low rates of interest with strong growth.
It is true that some economists point to the halcyon days of the 1950s and the beginning of the 1960s, when Europe, the - United States and the Japan prospered, but interest rates remained generally well below the rate of economic growth.
This time representing the golden age of global growth, why worry if we live the same phenomenon today?
What optimists forget is that these heavenly years were also a period of great insecurity.
Many were in fact feared the outbreak of the third world war, and rightly, according to many historians.
In this time - there, the spectrum of the Apocalypse allowed to keep loans at an affordable rate.
Fortunately, the worst fears of investors do not made, and can now only hope the same thing.
But if insecurity is one of the main reasons why interest rates are low, then the G8 leaders should be less quick to welcome.
The fragility of the collective investor psychology is well known.
If they calm down one day, interest rates will climb more beautiful and this could well bring to boil the latent imbalances in the world economy.
Political earthquake in Israel.
The Israeli political world is experiencing changes in the most impressive he has known for 30 years.
The realignment of parties and leaders is especially notable given the unexpected nature of the latest events in date: decision of Ariel Sharon to leave the Likud, the defeat of Shimon Peres as leader of the Labour Party and the withdrawal of the Labour Party of the grand coalition Government of Sharon.
It is more important than to grasp the meaning of these changes for the future of Israel, the region and the Israeli - Arab.
Schematically, the Israeli political system nears the end of its second era.
From independence in 1948 until 1977, the labour party has dominated, before yielding the place to an opposition coalition composed of conservatives, nationalists and centrist parties allied in the Likud bloc.
Since that time, the two parties successive ruling in turn, sometimes under broad coalitions and partnership with smaller parties sometimes.
On the surface, the rivalry between parties is played between "left" and "right", or "Hawks" and "Doves".
The truth, of course, is more complex.
Social class and economic problems, in the shadow of more persistent existential concerns, such as physical security and sustainability of the State have played a much less important role in Israel than in other societies.
Here, the political divide could be defined as the clash of the "optimistic" and "pessimistic".
The first, the Labour Party, believed that one day a force would prevail among Arabs and Palestinians ready to make peace on reasonable bases, while the latter, the Likud, were more circumspect.
For years, the discussion remained an abstraction, a debate about what might happen in the future, until the Oslo with the PLO in 1993 only begin to test rival visions.
Since 2000, the date where the leader of the PLO Yasser Arafat has rejected a political agreement and began instead a terrorist war in five years, there are few optimists.
The intellectual realignment that resulted in Israel gave birth to a new national consensus.
It is now widely accepted that, as the left has always said, Israel must be ready to withdraw from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and to accept the existence of a Palestinian State in Exchange for real peace.
But it is also widely accepted that, as the right has always supported him, none of the partners is really ready to make peace.
Within this context, Sharon won two overwhelming election victories as a radical while applying a moderate policy, including a total withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.
This is where is Israel today, facing a political upheaval fueled by two new elements.
First, Sharon moved the Likud to the Center, and indeed any hegemonic party by destroying all stereotypes about his personality, his methods, and his vision of the world.
It is however, for the same reason that many members of the Likud view Sharon, who helped found the party, as a traitor.
Sharon now needs to institutionalize his reforms, even if it is necessary to establish another party for this.
Secondly, the labour party has demonstrated its political bankruptcy, because its only conceivable leader was a Shimon Peres aged 82 years and its anachronistic optimism from Dove was turned into ridicule.
As a result, and thanks to a low rate of participation in the elections, the party primaries were won by Amir Peretz, outsider and populist who wants to revive the Labor Party, highlighting the social and economic problems, which means the withdrawal of the coalition of national unity with Likud.
Although it must form a new party, Sharon will probably win the next elections it has scheduled for February.
Peretz strategy will attract may be voters other left-wing parties, but labor will surely lose centrist voters (and those for whom national security is a priority) for the benefit of Sharon.
Ironically, all this will have a huge scope in principle and may be very small in practice.
While Sharon enjoys strong public support for a moderate policy, Israel will be more ready than ever to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, the Syria and the Arab world in general in order to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict.
However, given the chaos and paralysis that characterize more Palestinian policy, this opportunity will not have before.
The growing power of Hamas, which openly proclaims its strategy of increasing acts of terrorism and destroy Israel, does that strengthen this trend.
We can say the same of Syria, whose radical Government turns to a dangerously adventurous militancy.
Sharon could decide on partial withdrawals and dismantling of settlements in the West Bank.
But it is now widely accepted that such changes are a reaction to bleak prospects for real progress towards peace.
Cling to territories to make a bargain issues has much less sense if there's nobody with that bargain.
Israel will continue instead to treat as a priority its own security, strengthening its defences against terrorism and consolidating his control over relatively small portions of the West Bank that it intends to claim as its share of a possible diplomatic agreement.
Result of this strategy, associated with Palestinian attacks, international sympathy is growing against Israel.
This phenomenon could continue if current political realignment perpetuates, allowing Sharon to win in its programme the centre and even the moderate left.
Nothing is guaranteed, of course.
Benjamin Netanyaou, who remains popular, may very well become a powerful rival to his right, and Peretz can perfectly make the labour party a serious contender to his left.
Whatever it is, the national consensus has changed dashboard, shaking all beliefs on Israeli policies.
The February elections will submit these certainties to their toughest test in decades.

Ensure the future at the Evian Summit.
The paradox of our time is that the richest countries of the world have the power to do good, but they seem to feel obliged to miss the opportunities that are available to them in this direction.
States - United constitute the sample type by excellence: a country which spends 450 billion dollars a year on its defence budget and allocates only 12 billion dollars a year in aid to the development of poor countries.
They can bomb Somalia, the Afghanistan and the Iraq, but they seem ill-equipped to help these regions to develop.
Europe is not in a better position, paralyzed as it is by internal divisions and budget deficits.
At the G8 Summit, which will be held next week in Evian, the France will have a chance to make a new start.
For the billion people who is represented at the G8 Summit, life takes place relatively pleasant compared to the rest of the planet, with average incomes of $ 25,000 per person and a life expectancy approaching 80 years.
For about three billion people in the world currently, including China, the major part of the India and the East, economic development Asia is going relatively well, even if it displays a large number of high and low (lately, clash of the epidemic acute respiratory syndrome serious).
Economic trends also emerge in the Brazil and the Mexico.
But for the two remaining billion, life is hopeless.
For about a billion of them, their survival is precarious.
Millions of people die each year lack of access to medicines, food, safe drinking water and basic hygiene.
Their life expectancy is often less than 50 years and fall in many areas.
The G - 8 could put an end to the suffering of billions of the world's poorest people if he adopted realistic measures to solve their problems.
It does not because it not only greedy but also fearful.
He thinks that global poverty is inevitable and too costly to eradicate.
But it can solve the problems of the poorest individuals, with compared less effort and no significant negative impact on its own standard of living.
The most important problem areas are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, the Andean region and in Central Asia.
Other pockets of extreme poverty in China and India are on the track of improvement thanks to the rapid economic growth of these two giants.
But the problems in sub-Saharan Africa, the Andes and Central Asia do not of themselves resolve.
These regions are taken to the poverty trap.
Africa is by far the most affected.
The U.S. Government believes that these countries cannot get to them - same if they are poor.
But it is the ignorant boasting of a rich country who does not understand the situation on the ground.
Africa is taken to the trap of poverty for deep-seated reasons.
She suffers from endemic malaria, which resembles an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome that would last for centuries, and not for a few months.
She suffers from a climate prone to massive droughts and soil nutrients are depleted.
She suffers because most of its population lives in rural areas, without paved streets to reach ports and to facilitate access to international trade.
Except for a few countries of Western Africa, it suffers from a serious shortage of energy resources (coal, oil or hydroelectric power).
States - United don't never found themselves faced with problems of the scale of those afflicting Africa.
Ultimate irony, these serious problems can be solved, regardless of the cost.
It is at this level that the G8 must intervene.
The only commitment that must take the G8 leaders in Evian is to their previous promises that have not been kept for years.
During the three years, world leaders promised to take concrete steps to reduce world poverty by half by the year 2015, in a series of engagements known as the Millennium development goals.
But only small steps have been taken.
States - United increased their aid of 4 billion dollars per year while they have also increased their military spending of 150 billion dollars per year and reduced the taxes of trillions of dollars.
It is obvious that - United States the means to undertake more very large scale to help the world's poor countries, if only they provided.
The G8 leaders must commit specifically to financial assistance adapted to the world against AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria Fund, to increase the productivity of food in Africa through a new Green Revolution, to ensure that all poor children can attend school and that all the poor of all Nations people have access to safe drinking water and sanitation.
The total cost of this problem would be remarkably less than 1% of the annual income of the rich countries.
For the first time in history, the rich are so rich and the poor so poor a tiny effort of the rich could end a huge suffering.
The Evian Summit would clarify the situation and would know if greed, ignorance, and the bombast of war completely closed the eyes of the - United States and if Europe and the Japan will look into themselves rather than outwards.
Good reasons for slow population growth.
Global discussions on population policy are confusing.
On one side, it is argued that the growth of human populations threatens our environment and our prosperity.
Land, water, energy and biodiversity seem all suffer more stress than ever, and population growth seems to be responsible in large part.
On the other, the debate in rich countries mainly focuses on households and the small number of children they have, insufficient to take care of their aging parents.
Those who are concerned about population growth have the best arguments.
Issues facing Europe, the Japan and to a lesser extent States - United, as well as some middle-income countries face ageing population are manageable.
In addition, the benefits of slowing population growth outweigh the costs of adjustment.
On the other hand, if global populations continue to grow rapidly, the pressures on global resources will increase.
Governments should therefore refrain from implementing pronatalist policies, even there where birth rates are low.
The confusion of the public debate reflects in part different trends in different regions of the world.
The fastest population growth occurs in the poorest regions.
The poor, particularly the agricultural populations, tend to have a larger number of children (often up to six per woman) and as such have the highest population growth rates.
Poor farm families rely on their children for farm chores and security of parents when they are old.
Poor families lack access to contraception and family planning.
Finally, poor families many children like to insure against the high infant mortality.
Because of the birth rate very high in Africa, the United Nations population Division provides the doubling of the African population to 2050, is the passage of 900 million today to $ 1.8 billion.
The rapid population growth populations are also young populations because of the large number of children per household.
In Africa, the average age today is only 19 years and it is expected that it will be around 28 years in 2050.
In Europe, the trends are reversed.
The United Nations provide a population decline which will fall to about 630 million 2050, against 725 million today.
With fewer children and longer life expectancy, the average age of the population rises strongly in these forecasts and spent 39 years in 2005 at age 48 in 2050.
For the world as a whole, the population is expected to continue to grow by 2.5 billion between 2005 and 2050.
All of this growth will occur in the developing world: 1.3 billion extra in Asia, 900 million more in Africa, and the rest in Latin America and in other regions.
Increasing the world population of 2.5 billion people will accentuate pressure not only on companies where population growth occurs but also throughout the world.
The overall energy consumption takes off, reflecting the combined effect of the increase in income per head (and therefore the increase of the energy consumption per head) and population.
The high energy consumption already changes our climate in a dangerous manner.
In addition, the tensions created by overall population growth associated with growth revenues lead to rapid deforestation, depletion of fisheries, land degradation and loss of natural habitat and extinction for many animal and plant species.
Population growth in the developing regions, especially in Africa, India and other parts of Asia, must slow down.
Public policies can play an important role in improving the services of access to family planning for poor people, expanding the social systems of supported, by reducing infant mortality through investments in public health and in improving education and access to employment for women.
A part of the European public, noting the decline of European populations that threatens, wants to take the counter - foot and promote a return to large families.
It would be a mistake.
Population growth accelerated in Europe advocates worry the lack of young labor to ensure public pensions.
But this concern can be handled today by a savings increased the share of young people and middle-aged preparing their retirement and working at the - beyond from the age of 65.
These workers benefit more big benefits if they live in societies with stable or slightly declining populations.
Direct household expenses related to education of children will be obviously less important.
They will also save the investments related to infrastructure such as new roads, power plants, schools and other public services.
They will enjoy less congested cities and less pressure on the environment in the countryside.
European economies are less costs to support the limitation of the greenhouse gas greenhouse due to energy consumption, which will lead to a more effective control of climate change.
In short, the quality of life will improve with the decline of the European population in the years to come.
There's nothing radical here to call to the slowdown of the population growth.
For tens of thousands of years, the human population has tended to grow and decrease without really demonstrate a trend set in the long term.
It is only during the past centuries with the rise of modern economic life that the world's population took off, going from one billion people approximately in 1820 to 6.3 billion today and 9 billion projected for 2050.
This explosive growth was made possible thanks to huge advances in science and technology.
But this unprecedented growth has also challenged our planet.
We should intensify our efforts to slow population growth on a voluntary basis and we should recognise that the stabilization of the world population would now one more to human happiness and strengthen the sustainability of the environment for the future.
Foreign investors are - they still welcome?
Global flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) have exploded during the past twenty years, from $ 40 billion in the early 1980s to $ 900 billion last year.
The cumulative stock of FDI reached nearly 10 trillion, making it the most important mechanism of delivery of goods and services to foreign markets: sales by foreign affiliates total roughly 19 trillion, compared to world exports of $ 11 trillion.
At the same time, the liberalization of FDI regimes by virtually all countries represents a major force for trade between companies, the vital source of the emerging system of integrated production international and already about one third of world trade.
But this belle Ã©poque is - it currently touch to an end?
If the IDE can bring many benefits, there are also sometimes costs.
In the 1970s, when transnational corporations (TNCs) throwing in such investments began to get noticed, many Governments believed that the costs of FDI outweighed their profits and therefore controlled it.
The pendulum, held by developed countries, began fidgeting in the 1980s.
Once viewed as part of the problem, the IDE became a part of the solution to economic growth and development.
Nothing illustrates it better than changes in national FDI regimes.
As reported by the the United Nations Conference on trade and development, among the 2,156 changes that took place between 1991 and 2004, 93% were aimed at creating a more hospitable environment for TNCs.
But the risk of seeing the pendulum turn upside down is real, with result a decline in this liberalisation process.
FDI in developed countries (and increasingly in emerging markets) often takes the form of mergers and cross-border acquisitions.
Resistance to such approaches became more frequent when they involve firms that politicians consider 'national champions' or who play a role in national security, economic development or cultural identity.
The increasing involvement of capital companies - investment in the activities of mergers and acquisitions raises other controversies, because such transactions are typically considered to be purely speculative.
In the name of "economic patriotism", security and other considerations, resistance to mergers and acquisitions is codified in an increasing number of countries.
For example, a Committee of the U.S. Senate has recently tried to block the project of liberalization of foreign takeover rules for airlines, and Europe has implemented more restrictive takeover laws.
In addition, Governments apply more strictly existing regulatory provisions concerning the control of takeover bids by foreign companies.
This response is linked to a defensive reaction to the growing role of TNCs from emerging markets, "small news".
TNCs already well established, and their country of origin, will have to adapt to this new constellation of forces and its implications for the global market.
As other contexts have learned us, it is not easy to adapt to new entrants: compare, for example, the reaction between french Alcatel and American Lucent to offers by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation for Chevron or even that of Mittal for Acelor.
Another kind of defensive reaction, this time towards FDI outward, could well arise when the offshoring of services will have picked up speed.
Everything indicates that offshoring has reached a threshold and that this phenomenon will accelerate through the IDE.
If the countries of origin do not put in place of adjustment mechanisms to adapt to the fast revolution that makes marketable services sector jobs, a backlash against such FDI outward will be inevitable.
Increasing discomfort caused by the IDE is for the moment confined to developed countries.
Some signals yet that it extends to emerging markets.
In the case of large-scale projects, some host countries raise questions about the contracts that define their relationship with TNCs, and Governments are reviewing such contracts because they believe (rightly or wrongly) that they had not benefited from a market fair.
Among the 219 cases of international arbitration known concerning investment projects, some two-thirds have been initiated over the past three years.
Approaches to FDI have changed in the past, and they can still change in the future depending on how the Governments consider the balance of costs and benefits.
This balance involves not only economic factors but also of considerations such as security and the desire to control a country's economic development.
The concept of "nationalization of the 21st century", introduced by the Peruvian candidate to the presidential Ollanta Humala reflects the "economic patriotism" from french Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
The reservations against FDI (as with everything that is foreign) are found in all groups of countries, and when the politicians make the foreground protectionism is not far away.
It would be ironic that developed countries, which led the wave of liberalization of FDI of the last twenty years, launch a reverse movement.
Hope that the movement of de - liberalisation which we are witnessing in developed countries can be controlled until it does extend to other parts of the world and make suffer all the adverse consequences.
The culture of energy.
Warming to the instability of the oil prices, everything indicates that a global energy crisis seems imminent.
To meet this challenge, humanity can no longer afford to ignore the inexhaustible resource of biological materials that the Sun provides every day through photosynthesis.
Solar energy enables plants to absorb carbon and produce not only oxygen, but matter also that the animal Kingdom uses for food, and that our machines can use to obtain energy.
Since the Neolithic period, humans grow this biomass for food.
In our time again, its energy potential remains ignored.
From the industrial revolution, humans sought energy in coal, and later in oil and natural gas, which leads to the depletion of resources that are not renewable.
Alternatives to diversify energy production are limited.
Nuclear energy presents a number of drawbacks, particularly in terms of safety and radioactive waste.
Hydroelectric power is already widely used as wind and solar energy, they are structurally sporadic and unevenly available.
Biomass, on the other hand, has several advantages.
It is widespread, in large quantities, throughout the world.
In addition, on masters since long the technology necessary to convert it into energy, including efficient carbonization, gasification and liquefaction fuel synthesis.
This technology, widely used during the second world war, has experienced significant advanced since.
The biomass energy however suffers from unfair competition from fossil fuels.
Oil prices reflect its extraction, its refining and distribution costs, but not those of the creation of the raw material.
Millions of years and 200 tons of plants are required to produce one litre of oil, while it takes only 15 kg of plant material to produce one litre of fuel synthetic.
When oil flowed afloat less than 20 $US barrel, the attractiveness of the development of energy from biomass has declined and was more interested in "green" activists and those who were interested in basic science.
Yet the potential is huge.
The biomass of the planet: forests, pastures, savanna and cultures, constitute a productive capital which generates a "return" of 10% each year.
The image of a battery that is empty and recharges through the Sun, this energy is indefinitely renewable, as long as it is properly managed.
The annual return on this capital is currently estimated at 60 billion tons, and yet only two billion tonnes are consumed for food purposes and 10 billion tons for energy purposes.
Increase the responsible use of this energy source would help to combat climate change by reducing the proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and reducing the amount of fossil fuel needed to produce energy.
In addition, its abundance in the southern countries promises to facilitate their economic development.
Considered "the poor energy" until today, biomass could become a source of wealth as long as it is cultivated and operate with the support of the international community.
Thus, "energy crops" could be developed to produce biofuel.
The residues from forestry, agricultural activities and agro - industrial could be collected and converted.
The six million tons of waste produced each year by the Niger could theoretically be used to fully satisfy the energy needs of this country.
Cultivate energy surely would compete with food crops in many countries.
Long-term estimates predict that within the next 50 years, much of the arable land of the planet should be used to produce the food and for the protection of forest resources.
Therefore, the areas dedicated to energy production, including biofuels, may does not reach the level desired by companies.
But although such competition reveals new global shortages, it would also cause an increase in the price, thereby encouraging producers to increase their yields and productivity.
Certainly the energy crop would create new constraints, but it would also open up new opportunities for many economic actors.
The farmer and the timber operator could if investing in the market, the minor interest in cultures, banker to plant assets, etc.
It is necessary to implement new policies, the countries of the North and the South in terms of agriculture, management of water and land, protection of biodiversity, taxation of fuels, information and public awareness to prepare for an increase in energy crops.
The ancient Egyptians and the Incas practiced the cult of the Sun, because they thought that it was the origin of all life on Earth.
Science gave them reason since.
Today, while it has become more important that ever to use renewable resources, we should use the Sun to cultivate our energy, as our ancestors did for their food.
The culture of entrepreneurship.
Governments around the world wish to encourage the creation of companies.
Although many start - ups will never take scale, each small business is an experience, and it takes a lot to give birth to one likely to transform the economy of a nation, or even simply to acquire an international dimension.
In short, entrepreneurship is an incubator, by also essential to long-term economic success.
Nowadays, to explain the differences in terms of start-ups from one country to another, one looks at the dissimilarities of attitudes and national policies.
But we must also take into account large differences within countries.
The people of Shanghai are appears - it most enterprising from this point of view than those of Beijing.
The inhabitants of the Ukrainian city of Kherson are more than those in Kiev.
In a recent study, Mariassunta Giannetti and Andrei Simonov of the Stockholm School of Economics showed the magnitude of the differences in the field of entrepreneurship in the Swedish cities.
They define entrepreneurs as people who say resources from companies they control and in which they work at least part-time, and find that the proportion of CEOs of companies in the population differs substantially in 289 cities that they have studied, ranging from 1.5% to 18.5%.
That we say these differences on the real causes of entrepreneurship?
Policy changes at the national level cannot justify them only variations observed by Gianetti and Simonov.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the central agreements on wage thresholds have been dissolved and the Swedish Government decreased income and business taxes.
Accordingly, creation of business doubled in the country, but the response was very different from one city to the other.
Why?
Cultural variables seem to take much: half of the variations is to put on the account of religion and municipal politics.
More business leaders are the cities where they have a high proportion of retired members of the Church of Sweden (the official State church until 2000) and a consequent right electorate.
In addition, there is a rebound phenomenon: the cities that have the most entrepreneurs tend to create even more.
Once a culture of entrepreneurship takes root, it stretches that people know more about the business world and begin to feel attracted - even if the benefits are not immediately palpable.
Indeed, Giannetti and Simonov found that the average income of CEOs is lowest in cities with more start-ups than those who have less.
In the same way, from studies of other countries show that entrepreneurs earn often less initially and see their incomes rise less quickly than if they had been employed.
These studies suggest that there are differences in terms of entrepreneurship may be less due to better opportunities economic (the coast "offers" of the entrepreneurship equation) to cultural differences that make the most rewarding entrepreneurship from a personal point of view (the "application").
This hypothesis is put forward by Giannetti and Simonov, who believe that differences in prestige of entrepreneurs in different cities can justify disparities.
In some municipalities, entrepreneurs enjoy high social status, they are successful or not; elsewhere they are not considered and other activities are most admired.
The idea that the prestige is important is not new.
In his book morality and money, the sociologist MichÃ¨le Lamont compared definitions of success in France and States - United.
She asked residents of the two countries that means be "a person of value".
In fact, she consulted on what they consider important in life and their personal concept of identity.
Study of Lamont confirmed the conventional adage that for Americans, business success is important, whereas the French place first of all culture and quality of life.
In the same way a disregard open "after the gain" businessmen and the competition is most often expressed in France than in America.
But while Lamont focuses on the differences between French and Americans, the most interesting discovery of his research is that of significant differences between various regions of France.
It compares Clermont - Ferrand, chief - town of the Auvergne region, in the centre of France, and Paris.
The Auvergnats have a reputation for parsimony and rigour, and despite recent very consistent progress, of relative cultural scarcity.
Lamont has found that both the Parisians the Clermontois tended to experience contempt toward greed.
On the other hand, the Clermontois believe simplicity, pragmatism, labour, and the will, while Parisians attach more vigour and talent.
It concluded that in many respects the Clermontois are closer to the Hoosiers (the inhabitants of the U.S. State of Indiana, in the Midwest) as Parisians.
His research suggests that in Clermont - Ferrand, the intrinsic demand of enterprises is higher than in Paris.
Virtually all countries are sets of local cultures that differ in the way they motivate and shape their identity.
Differences in how these cultures define what it means to be a person of value, and how this value is seen, probably explain much of changes in levels of business start-ups.
Economists are not the only ones often consider the country as a whole, and to identify attitudes and national policies as the main factors of encouragement or discouragement of entrepreneurship.
But, in fact, the national success in this area depends on the evolution of local cultures and their interaction with national policies.
The enthusiasm for entrepreneurship may take root in any culturally attractive area of any country, once lifted the economic constraints that make it dam, then acquire a national significance by feeding him - even.
University investments.
Yale University, where I teach, says its Endowment Fund to one person, David Swensen, for over 20 years.
During this period, the portfolio rose just slightly more than 1 billion to $ 18 billion, or an average return of more than 16% per year, which is the highest of all the major universities.
And it shows no sign of weakness; during the last fiscal year ending in June, the return was 22.9%.
If successive presidents of Yale, Swensen remains.
He did more for the University than any what other president, or anyone else.
In a University, ideas matter more than money, but $ 18 billion may create a favourable environment for many new ideas.
With 11,500 students, done more than 1.5 million per student (not counting the buildings of the University or its collection of art, which are worth several billion dollars each).
How this could be possible?
How he could Swensen make so much money?
Everyone wonders - including us, at Yale.
Indeed, many here teach "efficient markets hypothesis", which claims that the financial markets of the world have become so competitive that it is impossible to earn a return on investment of more than normal.
Anyone who beats the market was simply a fluke.
The studies seem to confirm this phenomenon.
For example, a 2004 survey by Brad Barber and Terrance Odean of the University of California, Yi - Tsung Lee and Yiu - Jane Liu from the National Chengchi University, has collected data transaction-by-transaction of individual traders of the Taiwan stock exchange day.
The study found that only 1% of day traders reaping a profit - after deduction of the costs of transactions - during two consecutive six-month periods, and that the average profit was barely worth such an effort: 4 $US about.
It is easy to conclude that it is unnecessary to try to beat the market.
But then you think of people like Swensen.
The constancy of its good results can - she really be attributed to luck?
Robert Kiyosaki, author of the series of books on Rich Dad, Poor Dad, basic investment securities and the themes of his books on a comparison between his father very graduated and the father of his friend, who has left school in the fourth.
According to Kiyosaki, his father learned but impecunious tended to be pessimistic about the possibilities of each to achieve something in real life, and had discouraged his son to try.
On the other hand, the father of his friend loved trying to make great things.
The fact that he had become rich is - it a coincidence?
Kiyosaki tries can - be too to be uplifting, but I often think about him when I hear finance professors take a decision on the efficiency of markets and the absurdity that there is to earn money through transactions.
It may be that many academics find it difficult to take initiatives in the real world - and I've not yet met an another Professor saying having read Kiyosaki.
But Swensen is a University, doctor of economics.
It is surrounded by academics.
All these discussions about the efficiency of the markets have not discouraged him to try his luck and get there.
There seems to be a pattern there.
Two similar universities, Harvard and Princeton, have virtually experienced the same success.
The endowment of Harvard University, Jack Meyer Fund, increased its average annual return of 15.2% over the last ten years, that can be compared to 17.2% of Swensen, and Princeton Endowment Fund, under Andrew Golden, won on average 15.6% per year.
In fact, Golden worked under the aegis of Swensen at Yale from 1988 to 1993.
Swensen has written two books on investment, one for professionals and one for the general public.
Closing them, I did not have the impression of being able to do what he was doing.
But some elements are imposed on me.
One of them is its long-term vision.
Yale lets Swensen invest very long-term, and annoys him not with quarterly results.
This allows can - be to focus more on fundamentals in the long term, and thus to make investments which do not necessarily have a good performance in the short term.
But in fact, it has consistently received good results both short term and long term.
Part of the success of Swensen is "absolute return", a term now widespread in the investment community, he invented to describe the unusual investment strategies involving things like arbitration on mergers - acquisitions and difficulties (distressed securities).
He also invested in nontraditional assets, like real estate, oil, timber, capital investment, capital - risk and takeovers of companies companies.
These assets are generally not followed by many analysts, and are not easy to understand, which gave him a great advantage by leveraging its intellectual capacity and the know - how of his entourage.
In this sense, Swensen is totally different from the day traders, who invest in the short term while trying to beat the busiest market, that of the traded securities.
But I also think that the phenomenal success of Swensen and his peers reflects the environment that Kiyosaki criticizes.
The problem is a defeatist attitude, not scholarship.
When an analytical mind, a spirit to pursue truth with rigour, as an element of a community composed of such persons, is free of self-doubt, it can produce amazing things.
I know David Swensen, and I can attest that this is not a day lonely trader trying to beat the market.
He knows how to listen, support the people in whom he has confidence, and it is surrounded by many people with multiple and varied qualities.
And there is nothing of a defeatist.
A moral power.
According to forecasts, global meat consumption is expected to double by 2020.
Yet in Europe and North America, there were questions more and more on the moral aspect of the methods of production of meat and eggs.
The consumption of veal has fallen since it became known that to produce veal so-called "white" (actually pale pink), new - born calves are separated from their mothers, anaemic voluntarily, deprived of fibres and kept in stalls so small that they cannot walk or turn around.
In Europe, mad cow disease in shocked many, not just because she put coins the image of beef safe and healthy food, but also because the public has learned that the disease was caused by the feeding of cows, fed brains and nervous tissue of sheep.
People who naively believed that cows ate grass discovered that herds our food could eat anything, from corn to fish, litter pool (including excreta) waste from slaughterhouses.
The concerns raised by our way of treating farmed animals are confined to the small percentage of vegetarians or vegans, those who do not consume any product of animal origin.
Despite the strength of the moral arguments for vegetarian practices, they do not yet represent the prevailing view.
The most common position is that our consumption of meat is justified as long as the animals live a proper life before being killed.
The problem, as Jim Mason and I described in our latest book, The Way We Eat, is that industrial agriculture denies animals the chance to have a proper life.
Tens of billions of chickens today never go out.
It affects them so that they have a ferocious appetite and grow as quickly as possible then it raises in sheds that contain more than 20,000 animals.
The rate of ammonia in the air, due to the accumulation of their droppings, stings the eyes and hurts the lungs.
Killed in just 45 days, their immature bones can hardly support their body weight.
Some collapsed and, unable to reach the water or food, soon to die. Their fate is only a negligible amount in the economic ladder for the entire company.
Conditions are even worse for laying hens crammed into wire cages so small that even if they were only one per cage, they would be unable to open the wings.
However they are usually piled up by four, often more.
In such conditions of overcrowding, the most dominant and aggressive hens can sting lowest death of the cage.
To avoid this, the producers cut the end of the spout of the hens with a hot blade.
The spout of a hen is full of nervous tissue. It is, after all, its main means of communication with its environment, but no anaesthetic or analgesic is administered to relieve pain.
Pigs are may be the most sensitive animals and the brightest we have the habit of eating.
When they forage in a rural village, they can exert this intelligence to explore their environment and its diversity.
Before calving, sows use straw or leaves and twigs to build a safe and comfortable nest where caring their scope.
But in current intensive farms, pregnant sows are parked in crates so narrow that they can not turn, or even more than one do not in forward or backward.
They lie even the concrete without straw or other form of litter.
Piglets are removed from their mother as soon as possible so she can fall pregnant again, but they never leave the hangar prior to be taken to the slaughterhouse.
Defenders of these production methods argue that it is a response regrettable but necessary at the request of food of a population that continues to grow.
On the contrary, when we confine animals in intensive farms, we have to grow food for them.
The animals burn most of the energy supplied by this food just for breathing and heat their bodies, we reap so in the end a small fraction, usually not more than a third, and sometimes only a tenth of the value of the food we give them.
On the other hand, cows that graze in the meadows eat food that we cannot digest, which means that they add to the amount of food that is available to us.
It is tragic that countries such as China and India, as they get richer, copying Western methods and putting animals in huge industrial farms to provide more meat and eggs for their middle classes in full development.
If this continues, the result will be of animal suffering more large scale even than what currently exists in the West, more damage inflicted on the environment and an increase in heart disease and cancers of the digestive tract.
This will be also totally ineffective.
As consumers, we have the power, and the moral obligation, to refuse to support cruel rearing methods for animals and bad for us.
Fear and freedom on the Internet.
We learned earlier this month that at the request of the leaders China, Microsoft had closed the website of a Chinese blogger hosted by a Microsoft service called MSN Spaces.
The blogger, Zhao Jing, there had published information on journalists from The Beijing New strike, which followed the dismissal of editor-in-Chief free - thinker of the journal.
The gesture of Microsoft raises a question - key: Internet can - it really to be a liberating force that authoritarian governments cannot control as easily as newspapers, radio and television?
How ironic, when you consider that the founder and leader of Microsoft, Bill Gates, has been an enthusiastic advocate of this point of view.
Last October, he said: "there is really no way, in the broad sense, repress information today, and I think that's a wonderful progress which must all rejoice... It is a means of communication of openness and total freedom, and this is what makes it unique".
Despite these sentiments, Microsoft helps its best the Chinese authorities to censor information.
A door - word of Microsoft said that the company had blocked "many sites" in China, and it is well known for several months that the tool used to make Chinese blogs filter words like 'democracy' and 'human rights' when they appear in the titles of personal sites.
Microsoft's defense is that it must "comply with local and global laws".
But the MSN Spaces sites are hosted by servers in the United States.
Local laws to comply in this case are those of the United States, and Zhao Jing discussions about the strike of journalists in Beijing does not violate any of them.
There is no no longer world law preventing Chinese discuss events that their Government would prefer not seeing addressed.
The New York Times, for example, is free to publish articles on the strike, even if it is broadcast on an Internet site that all Internet users with free access are available.
If the Chinese Government does not want its citizens to read a foreign newspaper, it is for him to find a way to block their access.
The journal does have the obligation to do so in its place.
Microsoft's defense fizzled so.
We can only guess at the real reasons which led him to close the site; and fear of impact on its commercial interests in China could be a major factor.
Of course, a business can and must ask limits in the use of its services.
The absolutist line, which is to allow absolute freedom prevail, crumbles against disturbing examples.
According to Gates, Microsoft could prevent the use of its services if they were used to disseminate instructions for making a nuclear bomb, to send Nazi propaganda in Germany, where it is illegal, or to disseminate pornography.
These examples are - they really valid?
In his classic defense of freedom of expression, of freedom, John Stuart Mill argued that the most important reason to allow freedom of expression is to promote competition between possible the broader ideas, and that unfettered debate is the best way to test them.
By protecting the ideas of critics, the Government turns them into rigid dogma and without life, whether they are true or not.
If we agree with Mill, then a single example of Gates corresponds to the category of expressions to be protected.
Revenues from nuclear bombs are techniques, not ideas.
Pornography is not the expression of ideas.
Thus, we can restrict them both without contradicting the thesis of Mill.
(On the other hand, an essay saying that there's nothing wrong for adults to be sexually interested in children, and that such conduct should be admitted, expresses ideas, and also disgusting they may seem to us, as such should not be censored.).
The most difficult of the three examples of Gates is statements pro - Nazi on a site intended for the Germany.
It is easily understandable that the Germany wants to ban such opinions.
The laws of many countries prohibit incitement to racial hatred, which can be justified in accordance with the freedom of Mill, if such laws are closely focused on incitement to hatred rather that on the deletion of theses, as bad - they are, which rely on the intellectual abilities of people.
An advocate of the abolition of Nazi ideas could argue that they have already been tried, and they failed, the most abominable way imaginable, to produce a better society.
Whatever it is, the best possible sign that would show that the Germany has exceeded its nazi past would be to focus its laws specifically on racial hatred, rather than on Nazism as such.
In all cases, crackdown in China against direct reports and discussions around the events taking place in this country do not come back to deleting a discredited political ideology, but a political debate open and argued.
If Bill Gates really believes that Internet should have a force liberating role, it should ensure that Microsoft is not doing the dirty work of the Chinese Government.
The weaknesses of a strong dollar.
It is always dangerous to write an article on the exchange rate.
If the exchange of a currency rate is low, it may very well be on the rise when the article is published.
Remains a perpetual question about how to think exchange rates and their appropriate management.
The issue here is simply the dollar which drops, but rather what American officials intend to implement in this regard.
Paul O'Neill, the very direct ministre Minister of American Finance, suggests that States - United may not and do not want to intervene to support the dollar.
His comments have been criticised by some who see it as evidence of an abandonment of the policy of a strong dollar which characterized the Clinton administration.
One of the responsibilities associated with the economic leadership is to dispel economic myths, certainly not to create them.
The "strong dollar" policy represents a particularly egregious example of economic myths that can develop. This myth suggests that the American Ministry of finance could and would maintain a strong dollar, and that a strong dollar would be beneficial to States - United.
When I headed the White House Economic Council, it was often wondered if I supported the policy of the dollar strong.
I always answered that I supported the "balanced dollar" policy.
In other words, exchange rates are hardly different from other prices.
Just like the price of apples or oranges, they should be fixed by the law of the market.
Anyone who would prefer a policy of "the orange forte" would be immediately mocked.
And yet, many are those who appear to have the greatest confidence in the law of the market consider the exchange rate as governed by laws other than those of the regular economy that would make that a word or even a simple look on the part of the Minister of finance could raise or lower the currency.
The foreign exchange markets are of course very irrational.
Keynes described a day the stock markets as beauty pageants where the purpose was not to assess the most beautiful person but who others would top it.
The purpose of a foreign exchange market, in fact, is often to guess what other people think.
And even if government policies can affect the exchange rate in the short term, in the long run, only the rules of the market are.
The Government can find a legitimate role to play in limiting the volatility of the market, but if the basic rules of the market do not lead the dance of exchange rates, where does our confidence in the law of the market?
Relying on erroneous notions inevitably leads to great misunderstanding.
It came to pass one day that a journalist asked the Minister of American Finance on the negative effects of the strong dollar on exports (at the time, sales of cars and other export products suffered from this dollar strong).
He said that a strong dollar meant that the economy was strong and that as a result, exports in were reinforced.
Nevertheless, even the Ministry of finance, also quite make it, cannot evade the laws of the market economy.
Demand curves Flex: thus, when prices are high, American products are in less demand, and a strong dollar means that American goods are more expensive.
The most significant counterpoint to the strong dollar policy is that it encourages precisely this confusion between a strong dollar and a strong economy.
We should not us attach emotionally to exchange rates than at any other price.
A high exchange rate discourages exports and deal with unemployment of its work force, a country can see its economy go from bad to worse.
On the other hand, a high exchange rate can also help lower inflation, since the import prices fall.
If inflation is the primary concern then a high exchange rate may prove beneficial for the economy.
The strong dollar policy stinks smacked of an economic nationalism that stands out in the time of globalization.
If the dollar is strong, then the euro and the yen are weakened.
And what are the reactions of the political leaders of other countries?
Must - they simply comply with the dollar policy, even if it means a policy the yen or the weak euro?
It is necessary to create the conditions for a debate with the States - United as the strong dollar policy leads to an unusual situation: the richest country seems unable to live up to its means and must continually borrow hundreds of billions of dollars from abroad to finance its huge trade deficit.
The strong dollar has fuelled the bilateral with the Japan deficit more than Japanese protectionism.
He has also contributed to the protectionist policies of the States - United we see at work today in the price of steel.
It is high time that the ineptitude of the strong dollar policy be abandoned.
Paul O'Neill should be praised for its efforts in this area.
May - be could - it now start a serious reflection on the creation of an international economic system taking into account the devastating effects of the volatility of the market of major currencies for the least developed countries, in order to ensure greater stability.
We have for too long accused victims.
This we only has served to avoid serious consideration system him - even.
China it deceives his world?
Cheating!
How to declare the States - United, China could - it sell cheaper than U.S. producers in all areas?
For decades, America has appeared to dominate the manufacture so that US officials are focused on the liberalisation of trade for manufactured products.
They have devoted that little effort to establish a measure of equality for farmers because they knew that America could not compete on the agricultural map.
China now outweighs other countries, picking up huge trade surpluses with the States - United.
American Finance Minister accuses thus China to keep its Exchange deliberately rate low and asks him to leave the market trends determine the value for the reminbi.
The Chief Economist of the IMF, Ken Rogoff, who leaves his post, warns that trade surpluses are threatening global stability.
For those who remember the crisis which occurred in East Asia five years ago, all this seems to go against what is says at this time.
China was urged not to let its currency float.
Up to the implosion of the Argentine peso, fixed exchange rates, suited perfectly.
U.S. Department of finance welcomed the Government intervention in currency markets and encouraged the IMF to support such interventions with mega billions of dollars to countries in crisis.
If China had again let its currency float, celle - ci is would be deprecated and would thus intensified the crisis.
The country received a warning: avoid trade surpluses and accumulate foreign reserves because they are the primary means of first line of defense.
The countries of East Asia have followed this advice, for a very good reason: they had already seen the consequences of a lack of reserves.
The Governments of East Asia knew while the IMF policies serve to aggravate their economic decline, but they found themselves unable to resist.
The IMF had the money that they had an urgent need.
China and Malaysia, lucky enough to not have to turn to the IMF or brave enough to follow their own line of conduct, acted as it was: they led by expansionary fiscal and monetary policies.
China's economy continued to grow at 7%; the Malaysia had the shortest and the most superficial economic downward that is.
To understand the challenges of this economic struggle, it is necessary to explain some basic economic concepts in detail.
First of all, international trade is based on the principle of comparative advantage; countries export goods in which they have a comparative advantage and import those in which they have a relative disadvantage.
In General, America currently has a disadvantage on manufacturing while China has a relative advantage.
China needs to export products manufactured to the States - United.
Secondly, if a country invests more than it saves, it will be obliged to borrow and will therefore have a trade deficit.
The deficit arising from America is the result of mismanagement the Bush Administration unprecedented.
Tax cuts that America could barely afford turned a huge fiscal surplus into a massive deficit; rather than savings, the U.S. government borrows much abroad.
It is mismanagement, and not the policy of exchange rate for China, which is the culprit.
In fact, the overall trade surplus of China is currently low (approximately 1% of its GDP).
Of course, the Bush Administration wants to blame others, but neither China nor any other country, should be fooled.
It is reminiscent of events that occurred twenty years ago, when President Reagan had prepared of colossal tax cuts intended to redress the situation, but which have in fact resulted in huge fiscal deficits, which have in turn led to huge trade deficits.
At that time, it was on the Japan that America had rejected the responsibility of these deficits!
The truth is that neither the IMF nor the Bush Administration do really believe in free markets.
They impede the markets when they find their interest.
The Bush Administration bailed out airlines, brought unprecedented subsidies to agriculture and has protected the tariffs imposed on steel.
The IMF is right: there is a real risk of global instability, but the underlying cause of this threat lies in the massive borrowing by States - United overseas, which began under President Reagan.
States - United became a debtor country to huge debts.
If, one day, the creditors of America decide you want to be reimbursed, they could trigger large-scale movements of exchange rates and thus cause global instability.
For what reason the IMF did he not criticize severely these deficits?
Why should the richest country in the world - it living above its means while the IMF scolds poorer countries for smaller transgressions?
This problem is compounded by the reserve system world which welcomes applications for most countries of US $, but does that more penalizing.
The system requires that the country which holds the motto of reserve (in this case, the States - United) accumulate debts until other countries do him more confidence.
But to solve the problems deeply rooted in the global financial system, we must move beyond complacency that has long invaded the G - 7 and the unilateralism that defines the current US Administration.
China had reason to ignore the requirements of the America.
The floating of the exchange rate would have exposed the country to instabilities that would have led to myriad other problems, that would have particularly affected the country's fragile banking system.
A higher exchange rate would have undermined the process of job creation and contributed to the deflation, that China currently manages to repel.
China has the chance to have the freedom to pursue its own objectives.
Its immense reserves of foreign currency allow him to ignore the IMF and the U.S. Ministry of finance.
Finally, this freedom could be the reason the more convincing why China should continue to maintain trade surpluses.
Once again, China showed his mastery of the fundamental economic principles.
The other countries in the region would be lament have not acted similarly.
The Italy it will survive Berlusconi?
If the story seems ranger Silvio Berlusconi in the Italian Premiers of second order category, it will leave despite any remembrance of a Prime Minister out of the ordinary and most bizarre.
Make a promise, but keep another has instead been a principle of government action as a weakness.
Due to its unpredictable nature, he is hardly surprising since the 2001 election that brought him to power, the centre - left coalition L'Unione has won all the elections that followed (administrative, regional and European elections).
But the success of the left for the next legislative elections is uncertain and the fate of Berlusconi is not yet sealed.
Given the economic situation of the country, you would think the mature Italy for change.
For four years, the average income increased 0.3% per year, whereas it increased on average by 1.5% in the European Union, and for two years the debt began to widen.
The strategy of the coalition of centre - right Berlusconi, the Casa della LibertÃ , was to do nothing while waiting for the European economy is recovering, instead of treating the structural difficulties of the Italy.
This is why it is not only the trade unions who criticize the Government, but also the employers ' organisation Confindustria which had yet put all its weight behind Berlusconi in 2001.
We must also reckon with the incessant conflict between Prime Minister Berlusconi and Berlusconi magnate of the press who holds licences in the audiovisual field, which give it a position of semi - monopoly for advertising in the media and on TV.
During his tenure, his personal fortune was multiplied by three.
The parliamentary majority has voted number of laws in favour of his personal interests and smoothed some of the legal obstacles that stood in its path. However, in early March, Berlusconi was again accused of corruption and tax evasion.
The conduct of his ministers was hardly better.
Two of them, Roberto Calderoli and Francesco Storace, were forced to resign a month apart.
The first, a leader of the Northern League, the third largest party of the coalition Government by order of importance, caused the riots in Libya by wearing a T - shirt with the abominable caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad.
The second, former Health Minister and one of the leaders of the National Alliance, the second party in the Government coalition, is believed to be responsible for a case of political espionage, a Watergate Italian.
Despite this abysmal record, both from the point of view of the economy and ethics, polls, the Unione displayed a lead of four points only, too little next to the number of undecided voters to predict the outcome of the election.
What is it that makes that Berlusconi and his coalition are still in the race?
First of all, Berlusconi's election campaign, like that of Bush in 2004, aims to mobilize his supporters and attract the growing mass of abstainers.
To do this, he did not hesitate to use his semi - monopoly on television to praise the soi - saying wonders performed by his Government.
His campaign rhetoric is based on an anti-Communism that they had not seen in Italy since 1948, coupled to a defence of the family and the values dear to the establishment of the Roman Catholic Church, this well that the Church is not far left draw in the countryside.
The coalition of Berlusconi takes also advantage of the weakness of L'Unione.
Its leader, Romano Prodi, received a tremendous popular support with more than four million votes in primary elections, the first of its kind in Italy.
But him - even without a party, continues to be at the head of one too many parties.
The cohesiveness of L'Unione has strengthened: the two main parties (Democratici di Sinistra and Democrazia e LibertÃ  - la Margherita) are gathered behind the emblem of l'olivier, the other parties have agree on a government program detailed in a 280-page document and left Partito della Rifondazione Comunista party showed signs of moderation devoid of ambiguity and loyalty to the coalition.
Nevertheless, in the eyes of voters, the coalition remains fragile.
Ultimately, the uncertainty about the outcome of the elections reflects not so much the attitude of the voters that a change in the electoral system.
During the last decade, the Italian electoral system was based on a majority vote in a round with a dose of proportional representation.
With this system, Casa della LibertÃ  managed in 2001 to transform a small decisive electoral advance in a parliamentary majority.
But fearing that this system is now located at the Unione, the parliamentary majority of centre - right has changed the voting rules only a few months before the end of his term.
This is not without reminding the military strategy which is to defeat looming on the battlefield, to poison the wells before retreat.
A proportional system without the possibility to choose individual candidates is that they are the Secretaries of the parties, rather than the citizens, who will choose deputies, and in the absence of a real electoral threshold, parties are proliferating.
Ballots will be 40 centimeters long so therein all the symbols of the new and the old parties, but it will not find the name of a single candidate.
But the most serious is that the majority electoral system for the Senate could lead to a majority opposed to that of the Parliament, leading to a political deadlock.
And that is not all, the mandate of president Carlo Azeglio Ciampi will be completed at the same time where the Parliament will be dissolved, making that his successor who will be elected by the new members must may appoint a Government with a different majority in each Chamber.
Berlusconi and Prodi have ruled out a grand coalition of the kind that exists in Germany, a very unlikely outcome after a campaign in which each of the two candidates clearly suggested that the other does not have the right legitimate to govern.
And more an election would not solve the problem of the electoral system.
The puzzle - the political survival of Berlusconi reflects a broader problem at European level.
Many Europeans, and not only Italians, are worried and do not know where the continent goes.
It is therefore not surprising that an opportunist and a charlatan like Berlusconi continues to have the hearing.
Italians must decide for the future of their country if they want a leader that has the necessary stature.
The game of transatlantic criticism.
As if catches of bec diplomatic about the Iraq were not enough, relations between America and Europe are slowly poisoned by divergent economic policies.
Indeed, the differences between the economic strategies of the two camps are also net than they have been for two decades.
At first glance, the depth of this 'political divide' seems surprising.
The Economic Outlook for the rest of this year and for 2004 have recently improved both the US and in Europe.
In addition, the US and Europe face a similar challenge: promote the economic recovery.
But the actions of their Government (or rather lack of action) seem to indicate that none of the two camps can see the problems faced by the other.
During the introduction of the euro, most members of the EU (Germany, in particular) have waited impatiently to manage their economic policies with more autonomy and less US pressure.
Thus, the current structure in the euro area, with its unique mix of joint monetary policy and national responsibility for fiscal policy, was not built to facilitate macro - economic coordination with the USA.
But the perception of many American observers was different.
They considered the involvement Central euro as requiring Europe to cast his supposed role as "free rider" on the international economic scene, a role that has left the US shoulder the burden of policy adjustments to promote global growth.
Europe would be inevitably forced to coordinate its policy with America.
These two views were doomed to conflict and this is what is happening today.
Tensions hidden during the long boom of the era Clinton themselves are revealed in 2001 when America tried to cope with the decline of its economy by quickly releasing its monetary and fiscal policies.
When the large budget deficits returned surface, European skepticism about the viability of the external deficit growing America and the overvaluation of the dollar also reappeared.
Between - time American critics felt the euro area as overly conservative when it slowly reduced interest rates and maintained the fiscal constraints of the stability and Growth Pact.
Originally, Europeans had sub - estimated the economic downturn which they were confronted.
Subsequently, they were forced by the limits to their fiscal reactions, limits set by the Maastricht Treaty; the large economies of continental Europe had not reached a sufficient budgetary consolidation during the years of continued growth.
Monetary and fiscal policies facilitated growth, but Europe has not much to redress the external imbalance of the America.
Of course, the euro area is so vast that it can no longer abdicate responsibility for stimulating global growth in America.
But U.S. efforts to encourage Europeans to adopt their pragmatic and discretionary approach to economic policy inevitably lead to frustration: the problems encountered by European economies differ from those faced by the USA, as perceptions of the challenges.
In fact, the main reasons for the massive change in American public finance (of surplus in 2000 to a deficit of over 4% in 2003-2004) have little to do with stabilization.
More costs of the war in Iraq and other security issues and deficiencies in previous controls spending, US tax cuts follow objectives structural and distributional rather than short-term goals.
A stimulus in the short term would not confer more significant benefits to wealthy people, whose spending is less sensitive to taxes.
Tax cuts should support private demand this year and the year to come, but at the cost of postponing improvements in economies and private debts.
Although the dollar has depreciated during one year, the continued growth of the domestic demand will probably push the current accounts deficit to exceed 5% of the GNP.
While the deficit widens further, it is likely that the dollar is again depreciated despite the rather slow performance of other major economies of the world.
The USA accept - they extended a slowdown after 2004 and Europe will make a greater contribution to global growth?
It is likely not.
The equivalent of the emphasis placed by the USA on independence rather than public assistance direct is represented by the desire to maintain employment levels, regardless of the party in power, while most European countries have been prepared to accept unemployment of 8% or more.
The US should therefore opt for growth.
Despite three years of low growth, the gap between the potential yield and the actual performance in the major economies of continental Europe is currently smaller than in the US.
Income tax cuts aimed at stimulating demand for hand - work and investment are desirable given high rates in the major economies of Europe.
But tax cuts that must soon be cancelled mainly due to demographic pressure on pensions and public health care are unlikely to stimulate demand, consumers losing indeed trust in the ability of the Government to control deficits.
Europe needs structural reforms and tighter fiscal management, and not inflation.
The EU countries are finally being to accelerate their implementation of structural reforms, but the starting point has become less favorable and political resistance too firmly rooted, as illustrated by the recent conflicts over reforms of French pensions and the German labour market.
A further depreciation of the dollar and slower U.S. growth would undermine exports from the EU, the only component relatively crowned with success of the demand in Europe.
The divergence of policy and its time horizon will be hidden by the improved prospect of growth in Europe and the USA for the upcoming year.
But the medium-term perspective is one of transatlantic confrontation likely to create as many divisions as the conflict on the war in Iraq.
If this is true, the Cycle of international trade negotiations of Doha, which stands currently, could be the first to suffer.
It will be harder to resist protectionism on both sides of the Atlantic.
The US cannot afford a continuing massive drain of demand through an external deficit, while complaints related to the loss of competitiveness are growing in the EU.
Thought that the confrontation macro - economic future could subside quickly or quietly puts the imagination strained.
A multilateral engagement for energy security.
The different countries of the world are also strongly linked by their common need for energy security as the global network that assures distribution of this energy.
A failure in one point on the network, and we are all affected. Local interests and the lasting conflicts that intervening, in particular the unresolved question of the supply of the Ukraine and Russian gas Europe, remind us once more that energy can be used as a means of political pressure.
Energy security is one of the priority themes of the meeting of the G - 8, received the St. Petersburg President Vladimir Poutine.
The G - 8 has been able to identify the economic issue, namely energy interdependence, and it is now time to take specific multilateral commitments in this area.
For some countries, who have the chance to have vast reserves of oil and gas, it is tempting to use exports to help friends and punish enemies.
But nowadays, such a strategy is likely to destabilize both friends and enemies, and prejudice to the producing country.
Generally, embargoes do not bring expected results.
The increases triggered by the actions of OPEC in the 1970s were not tenable and encouraged consumption savings and the development of production in the country. non - OPEC members.
This has led a fall in the share of OPEC in world oil exports within twelve years of the embargo of 1973-1974.
Experience has taught us that transparency and price stability are in the interest of all.
It is essential to increase the potential for growth of the world economy, to keep these principles while encouraging the development of international markets.
When the Russia envisaged this year multiply by four the price of its gas exports to the Ukraine, she claimed to apply the market price.
Seemed just and, for awhile, some investors and political leaders gradually due to the situation allowed themselves to be seduced.
Let us be clear, measured and gradual price evolution has never been challenged; some adjustments were needed to the Ukraine.
But, unfortunately for the neighbours of the Russia, this is not the market that sets the price of Russian gas or transit: this is the Gazprom company and its president Dimitri Medvedev, also first vice - Russian Prime Minister.
The price charged by Gazprom is different for each neighbouring country of the Russia, and determined to a large extent by diplomatic relations of these countries with the Kremlin.
Prices depend on further political situation that supply and demand or transportation costs.
The Ukraine was threatened to see its gas bill immediately multiplied by four - or its supply suspended - because she had to take independence from Russia during the orange Revolution.
Georgia, which had angered Moscow with its rose Revolution, could also suffer considerable price increases.
On the other hand the Belarus, always very close to the Kremlin, continues to benefit from subsidies in the energy sector.
Of course, the Ukraine was not the only country affected by these manoeuvres of intimidation: some suppliers such as Turkmenistan, that geographic location requires transit gas by the Russia, also suffer.
As the consumers of Western and Central Europe countries, rising prices and fears of an interruption of supply had important consequences.
This is probably the immediate multilateral intervention of the European Union and the States - United which prompted Gazprom to reopen the valves.
Natural gas is may be the raw material supply is the most vulnerable to the political whims.
The fixed interconnected pipelines compel producers and consumers to almost absolute fidelity.
Diversification of the natural gas is a long-term cross-border project, which requires considerable investment and multilateral political commitment.
Many solutions are under consideration: new storage devices of gas, efficiency, development of domestic production of oil and gas, and other energy sources such as coal methane.
In addition, the liquefied natural gas (LNG) market is rapidly growing.
It is easier to diversify the supply chain, even gradually, by importing gas from distant producers, rather than neighbouring suppliers enjoying a monopoly.
All these initiatives should help absorb the shocks and create greater energy self-sufficiency.
But we must go further.
First of all, the G - 8 leaders should consider implementing standards for transactions in the energy sector, and to require open and transparent contracts comply with best business practices.
It is essential to minimize the impact globally of the behaviour of local politicians pursuing non-energy or any goals simply their personal interests.
Observed problems of this type in the State of Latin American companies, with political instability in Africa, tensions in the Middle - East or even some opaque intermediaries, such as for the questionable contract signed between the Ukraine and the Russia gas, under the name of RUE (RosUkrEnergo).
Ultimately, energy security for us all in Europe is based on the recognition of our interdependence.
This is why it would be useful to create an "energy alliance" of consumers and suppliers, in which European countries themselves will have to refuel mutually important disturbances.
The Energy Charter, which emphasizes market access and transparency, is a laudable effort, but it is insufficient in times of crisis. Our markets are not yet sufficiently equipped to handle interruptions of supply.
The Charter energy could serve as basis a collective energy security, provided thorough and enlarged.
It is our duty as leaders find a path to energy security for the future.
If some tolerate today suspicious transactions by political expediency, we pay all dear one day where the other.
When inevitable conflicts erupt, the public's confidence, political credibility and the laws of the market are sacrificed needlessly. This is clearly what has happened with the Russia and the Ukraine.
Threats to energy security must be resolved multilaterally, with the participation of all stakeholders and regions.
Our interdependence requires us to adopt a multilateral approach.
It is our future that is at stake.
Reform or revolution in Iran?
The Lebanon at risk of manipulation.
In recent weeks, Lebanese politicians from groups as diverse that Hezbollah and the Lebanese Forces Christian meet from time to time as part of a "national Dialogue".
Their first objective is to forge a consensus on the future of the Lebanon after the withdrawal of the Syrian army which took place last year.
But this dialogue especially shown that Lebanese politics continues to play out of the Lebanon.
The Syrian regime of president Bachar El Assad retains huge influence on the Lebanese State, particularly with regard to security issues, the secret services, the army and the police, not to mention its alliance with the powerful Hezbollah militia.
The Syrian soldiers left Lebanon a year ago, but the El Assad regime has never accepted its withdrawal from the Lebanon and it seeks to regain some form of hegemony over the country.
The Syrian position is made more difficult because of the UN investigation, which accused him of being involved in the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri on February 14, 2005.
The Syria's Lebanese allies want to improve ties between the two countries, but the assassination of Hariri them will probably not succeed.
For the moment, Lebanese parties agreed to not let the country be used to threaten in any way the Syrian regime.
At the same time, Egypt and Saudi Arabia want to avoid the fall of the regime of Al-Assad.
Officially these two countries prove to be favourable to the UN investigation, but privately, their leaders have heavily encouraged the Lebanese Government to release pressure on the Syria.
In Lebanon, the opponents of the Syria have resisted this requirement, but the position of Egypt and Saudi Arabia shows that Arab leaders do not want the collapse of the other despots in the region.
The attitude of Egypt and Saudi Arabia differs can more than two very influential Western powers in Lebanon, the USA and France, which support investigation of the United Nations, wherever it leads.
Nevertheless, these four countries agree that Syrian influence in the Lebanon must be contained, and they show favourable, at least in theory, for the disarmament of Hezbollah demanded by resolution 1559 to the Security Council, even if their views differ on how to achieve this.
Another regional problem, the cycle of violence without end between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq, also marks the Lebanese domestic politics.
Sunni and Shia Lebanese - the two main communities in the country because their demographic weight and supports available to them in the region - are far from being at this stage, but recently the political tension is palpable between them.
Hariri was the main Sunni political leader, and after his assassination, the two communities have adopted positions diametrically opposed to the Syria.
The gap between Shiites and Sunnis in the translated Lebanon of much wider regional differences between the majority of the Arab countries (including Saudi Arabia) who are Sunni and support Saad Hariri, the son of the murdered Prime Minister, and the Iran, which supports Hezbollah.
In Saudi Arabia, Shiites are concentrated in the East of the country which contains the bulk of the oilfields and the Saudis fear that the discord between Shiites and Sunnis in Iraq extends in the Arab world and not to reach.
This is why Riyad has encouraged Hariri to not break the dialogue with Hezbollah, the main force in the Lebanese Shiite community.
Apart from this concern, Saudi Arabia and Egypt are concerned that if the Iran manages to hold the nuclear weapon, this does result in a domination of the region by the Shiites.
Add to that the tension between the Iran and the United States, the controversy over the conflict in Iraq and the nuclear-powered.
The Arab countries are taken sandwiched between the two, as the Lebanese, who are afraid to pay the price in the event of Israeli or American attack against Iran's nuclear facilities. As Hezbollah could attack Israel from the South of the Lebanon.
Hezbollah interpreted resolution which calls for its disarmament as a plot by the Bush Administration to weaken it and display American supremacy in the region.
He refuses to disarm against what he calls the "Israeli threat", but he changed so many times the definition it gives of this threat that it is questionable if it will never give up weapons.
It has recently agreed to include this item on the agenda of the negotiations of domestic policy - may be because the Iran does not want this to become a cause of tension in the country - but it is unlikely that they lead to genuine disarmament, at least in the short term.
Finally, the Lebanese must not only operate on the basis of considerations of regional and international policy, but they must also take into account American domestic policy.
Whatever opinion we have over the war in Iraq, it must agree that the American presence in that country helped Lebanon to thwart the attempts of the Syria to return foot to the Lebanon, and those of some Arab countries aimed at forcing Lebanon to deal with a regime that adapts to its sovereignty.
If the USA really withdraw from the Iraq, they may become indifferent to the Lebanese situation.
In this case, who else the Syria and the Iran will withdraw profit?
Such result would be probably satisfactory for some elements of Lebanese society, particularly Hezbollah.
But the vast majority of the Lebanese want a Lebanon in peace, which escapes the isolation and the activism that characterized the Iran and the Syria.
Unfortunately the Lebanon has always been buffeted by its environment and once more, against the will of the Lebanese, it may serve as an arena for destructive regional conflicts.

After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague rectifia stock exchange losses.
Transactions with the ÄEZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily trade.
Tuesday, at the start of trade, the Prague stock exchange resumed with its fall of the day before, when it lost almost six percent.
This time -, the decrease is due to the fall of shares on Wall Street.
The market reaction to the result of the vote of the House of representatives, which refused to adopt the plan of stabilization of the U.S. financial sector, is noticeable also among us.
Drop actions in Asia.

Interest rates have in Hong Kong the same level as States - United.
The Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal from supports of the financial system.
Otherwise, we risk that other countries suffer impacts.
The bloodbath of US actions.
Monday, the House of representatives rejected the project of supports for the financial system, to which it ought to spend up to $ 700 billion (nearly 12 billions of KÄ).
Lawmakers thus repudiated the call to the supports project of president George Bush.
According to Bush, the project should address the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stock lived, Monday, a blood bath and various indices of shares suffered the biggest fall in 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost almost seven percent, having experienced a fall of this magnitude for the last time in 1987.
The index lost already during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in freefall.
The Congress ceded: the US Government can inject $ 700 billion into the banks.
Leaders of the U.S. Congress and the Government of president George W. Bush began to agree on a broader form of the agreement concerning financial assistance to the American financial system.
It will be put to the vote at the beginning of next week.
US Lawmakers made a turning point in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for a $ 700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns), granted to the U.S. financial system.
Success is not so sure.
Indeed, before you can publish the final version of the Bill and submit it to the vote, the Congressmans must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The plan of supports of the financial system will be examined Monday in the House of representatives.
Said Sunday the agency Reuters Barney Frank, the Chairman of the ComitÃ© de la rÃ©glementation bancaire et financiÃ¨re of the Chamber.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should a priori be put to the vote in the Senate.
According the economists, the announcement of the fact that the rescue plan will be adopted should constitute a first major psychological factor to revive financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which the futures markets can be effective, will follow a "disillusion".
Paulson: The plan shall be effective.
"We have made a great progress.
We have set our divergent opinions regarding the form that should have the package of measures for the stabilization of the market ", entrusted to the Agency Bloomberg Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
According to her, the final vote could be taken as early as Sunday.
In the night from Saturday to Sunday, representatives of legislators met the Minister of finance American Henry Paulson, to give a final form to the bottom of the Government.
-Ci should redeem the financial companies unsaleable assets leading financial firms in considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system in its entirety.
"We are about us to agree on a plan that will work and which must be, also, effective on the market.
Should still continue this recovery plan for the market, but I think that we are ", said Paulson.
A signal for Asian trade.
The global financial crisis has considerable implications for equity markets that fall.
According the Democratic Senator Ã©vadiez Harry Reid, legislators are so that the Congress will lead to a final agreement as soon as Sunday.
They thus want to soothe investors before the start of discussions on the Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the decision of the Congress could affect trade in Monday.
However, for the moment, it is impossible to specify with certainty when the two houses of Congress American will proceed to the vote, or if the negotiations are unlikely to remain blocked at the last moment by this or that problem.
Legislators hope it will be adopted in the coming days.
Nevertheless, the Act will be still many changes.
The total amount using the system should be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars, as wished by president George Bush, must be available as soon as possible.
But, if Congress will have the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, it has the ability to block the granting of the remaining amount, using two steps: first, additional $ 100 billion, then, finally, $ 350 billion.
Mr. Bush hailed progress in the negotiations.
While the president could veto that decision, Congress, he has the ability to put one - in minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain finance for bad real estate securities, whose value fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of representatives should be able to proceed Sunday to vote on the Bill, and the Senate Monday ", indicated the Republican Senator Judd Gregg."
US president George Bush is him - even happy with the progress in the negotiations.
Door sound - speech Tony Fratto declared that Mr Bush was happy with progress made Saturday and appreciated "the effort bipartisan to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restrictions on golden parachutes.
The Chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, Chief negotiator, said that legislators are set to agree on the responsibility of the financial programme, protection of contributing against loss, relief agreement, the progress of the plan on the time axis.
The new law also plans to limit so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the program, and it establishes a Committee, which will conduct oversight of the Fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of finance.
"We have worked very hard on the issue and have made significant progress toward an agreement that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also provides assistance for homeowners, who have problems to pay.
The Government should negotiate new payments in the case of mortgages that it will redeem, while lowering the monthly payments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance.
According to the Chief Economist of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea but its implementation is going to be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that it is unclear what will be the mechanism and the price of the assets to problems.
This point will be crucial to decide on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the Government ", said Marek, this week, to server iHNed.cz...
If the plan will be adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, is, according to Marek, not that important.
"It is much more important that the congressmans agree, as early as this week, that they support this plan and they dedicate it as soon as possible.
This psychological meaning of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, matter most at this time ", said Marek.
A push to the extreme struggle: MP3 players against mobile.
We will advise you, how to choose.
While virtually all mobile can read MP3 files, no MP3 player knows call.
It seems to result clearly it is better to buy only a phone.
Nonetheless, there are enough reasons to get a standalone player.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the House an expensive high-end gramophone to put the new album from Maxim turbulence.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl, and from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for that to happen.
However, if there is in your shelves of vinyl records crammed with rock art, jazz or blues, you at least probably dream of such gramophone.
It is the same music during travel, namely compressed music, to put in a simplified way - MP3 music.
There too, there are categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a drive, in the same way as a fan of Pink Floyd would have difficulty in supporting headphones purchased for twenty crowns in the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The service life of the batteries is also decisive.
Some high range music players are capable of many more things than to a simple playback of music, but it is of unknown functions, of course, most of the mobile.
No current camera is as universal as the telephone.
Next to the first functions, telephone calls and sending SMS, it is capable of playing music and movies, to record these last, he has a camera of varying quality and can, for example, to be used for navigation.
And if one takes into account the Smartphones and communicators, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
Because no frigidaire knows grilling meat and no television will take photographs, we are witnessing virtually a miracle.
However, the universal nature of the mobile is not without drawbacks.
The more functions you use, the more the interval between refuellings will be reduced.
And the music playback is one of the most important energy gluttons.
Are rare mobiles that are capable of reading music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases, this figure is much lower.
In this regard, (especially the most rudimentary) music players are much better.
In the case of cheap mobiles, expect they won't play the music for a few hours.
If, moreover, you happen to call from time to time, pick - up, to be sure, a second charge for work - this being valid even for more expensive equipment.
SE problem will not arise for MP3 players, who are able, as a result of a reload of continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including less efficient.
Another problem occurs when recording music in mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a Universal USB connector, as not all can be connected directly to the computer, without a special software.
It may, of course, save music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know to go without reduction, given the tiny dimensions used in mobile memory cards.
In regards to readers, you need, except (iPod), no software.
Simply fill the instrument of music from the computer through the USB connector.
Most mobile phones and readers will create themselves a media library ranked by the name of the performer, the title of the album, style, or in the judgement of the user then.
Some devices show only an index with a tree structure, like the Windows Explorer, others are capable of two (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones have more know-how.
In the choice of a concrete apparatus, are interested - especially to the lifetime of the accumulator, the memory capacity, the quality and the type of output sound and, of course, to the ease of the command.
If the music is for you, essentially, background noise, and if the day you listen during a limited time, for example by taking the tram, just no matter what mobile reading MP3.
Virtually all mobile are now able to.
You don't even have too pay attention to music formats that the mobile or the reader is able to read.
All arrive to play MP3 and the vast majority of music that will be sent to you precisely will this format.
It is part of the most popular formats, and apart from him, the vast majority of devices can read music to WMA format.
The AAC format (used by the firm Apple and its iPods), meanwhile, is less common.
High range mobile can also, for example, the purchase of music online.
Just visit from the phone, the web pages of the operator (or those of another provider) corresponding and buy the song or the album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to get a musical mobile.
Operators offer is unfortunately crappy and is limited, in most cases, the radio quickly made tubes.
Prices are no lower.
However, it is considered that this way to buy music (whether by GSM, internet, or by wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their mobile on itself.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you have to remove the mobile from your pocket, while you forgot your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you still on you headphones or even a handsfree connection.
If not, you can use the built-in speakers that possess virtually all mobile, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of the musical mobile is their price.
The cheapest cost normally less than three thousand.
For a price of three four thousand crowns, can already have a walkman very suitable.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of ordinary headphones output.
The price of the best phones and better equipped, also an entry for ordinary headphones, equipped with does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy command.
Really anyone happens to ensure control of the most rudimentary readers - who do not necessarily correspond to the least expensive (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the likeness of the command with that of a cassette post, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There's no risk of collision in the form of a mobile internet connected by chance, followed a huge bill for data transmission.
What camera select.
Even the cheapest mobile (eg. Vodafone 527) usually have an exchangeable memory card slot (type M2, microSD, and so forth).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you're not going to exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models do support in principle as cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones come out even with 8 GB memory cards.
If already own you a mobile and want to still buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you don't have to spend more than 1 100 kroons.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, choose rather mobile - specialized walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent keys for MP3, and it is as well as the ease of the command approximates that of an independent MP3.
Sony Ericsson, including the walkman series mobile have the same menu user that drives MP3 sold separately, is one who went furthest in this area.
The same service in the same category of price, but with a capacity of memory (up to 16 GB) and a service life of the accumulator (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours) above, is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the above brands.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year - even.
-Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, lack us all the same something - a virtual network operator, that would force the traditional operators to lower prices.
May it not fail for a long time.
We have already mentioned, repeatedly, on Mobil.cz Czech operators form part of the most expensive in Europe.
ÄTU (the Office Czech des tÃ©lÃ©communications), who reported that the price of an SMS is higher here than in the rest of the Union, it has confirmed.
It is as well as, following the last not the European Commission in the field of the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation may occur - the SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of the Czech mobile operators cheapest qu ' in the country.
How is it possible that the price in the Czech Republic maintain so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks competition really wishing to get into the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we have still three mobile networks and a penetration that exceeds 100%.
Instead, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely concurrenciez.
In this, Pavel DvoÅÃ¡k, the president of the Council of the Czech Office of telecommunications (ÄTU), which has repeatedly stated that in the Czech Republic there was more room for another operator, chimed in with the operators.
It is probably true that a classical operator with its own network was apparently much luck (also, now, it would be that difficult of frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators in the mobile market which has resulted in a considerable decrease of prices, which were, subsequently, also react conventional operators.
Yet, even before the entry of disorder - festivals such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, voices similar to those heard today from us is suggested in Grande - Bretagne.
However, it appeared that there was room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
Moreover, we are not forced to go to look too far to find examples.
In February we had informed you launch, in Poland, the Mobilking virtual operator.
In just six months, this operator has managed to win over 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator of the country.
Add that behind the Mobilking, there is the financial group Penta, which has among other things the U: fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators the possibility to focus on a much more practical target group.
If their operation to be effective, they have indeed need much less customers than a traditional operator.
They are free of construction costs, operating and maintenance of the mobile network, relatively high.
It is as well as in the world, virtual operators emerge as operators at low expense - they offer calls and cheap SMS, which is often offset by one offers limited services.
For example Tesco Mobile offers in Grande - Bretagne, SMS at least two times less expensive than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland, bet on a group of unusual target can also be a good publicity stunt.
Indeed, this operator aims specifically men.
"Real men choose Mobilking - an operator that please them and to which they can trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, exploiting this virtual operator.
It is hard to say, if such a concept would be likely to walk also with us.
Miroslav Äepicky, door - word of Vodafone, in doubt: "the Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which is based the majority of virtual operators.
As it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services "."
Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators.
Nevertheless, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual network operator in the Czech Republic, will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this project to success, but Obec negotiations are not very promoter.
Mobilking launch will instead be held in other countries of our area ", said in one maintains for Mobil.cz Jana StudniÄkova, door - word of financial group Penta."
It thus indirectly confirmed that operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do their utmost so that a potential competitor may appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would thus take a not new in order to become a real competitor to Telefonika in the field of business, customers hides not, long enough, its intent to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We would like to be able to offer our customers not only fixed, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We already conducted negotiations about this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have managed to move forward in the negotiations ", said the spokesperson - the Group Pavel Kaidl.
The future is therefore may be promising.
According to non - official information, it seems that we could possibly host the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for now, its creation is accompanied by total silence.
"At this moment, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is compared to others very specific.
For the moment, no subject equipped with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us ", said Vlastimil SrÅ¡eÅ Telefonika O2 Press Department, in his statement for Mobil.cz..
Other operators reported also to the specificity of the Czech market.
-Spokesperson for T - Mobile Martina Kemrova says in a rare agreement with O2 statement: "We have not registered for the project viable and bilaterally advantageous moment, which could serve as a basis".
And she adds: "it is practically impossible that a virtual operator appears in the network T - Mobile by the end of the year.
To operate in a limited period of time, we should have now a concrete agreement "."
Vodafone leads rather focus on the fulfilment of requests for its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Äepicky says in this regard: "we are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and particularly in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This is what, according to us, means the most input from the point of view of customers.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this field being the discovery of a partner to put in place a common network for a mobile internet rapid "."
Authorities: in tune with operators.
Mobile operators approach is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a fall in prices and therefore to a decrease in their profit.
What good therefore facilitate the achievement of such competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators know agree as thieves. The chicane accompanying the establishment of the U: fon also testifies.
The greatest pressure apparent on the ÄTU, during the creation of the U: fon, was exercised by the company T - Mobile.
Evidenced by the publicly available information obtained from the web pages of the ÄTU.
However, today, the U: fon lends itself serve as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrova was noted in this regard: "competition in the mobile market was, moreover, recently amplified by the entry on the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an extra player submit it, and above all its services, to high requirements "."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators that behold, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seem disconcerting.
It is yet not only the attitude of the ÄTU, which, unlike the Great - Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately did not, in the Czech Republic, the power to intervene in economic competition.
-Above belongs exclusively to the Office for the protection of economic competition (ÃOHS).
However, the latter adopted, faced with this problem, its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question relating to the leasing of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement was concluded for the moment, because the supply of potential stakeholders has a priori not presented enough interest for traditional operators ", said in response to our question Kristian Chalupa of the Department of external relations of ÃOHS.
A formulated statement so wouldn't surprise on the part of representatives of the operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and among other also take care that nobody benefits from its position on the market, such a statement is more than confusing.
As Kristian Chalupa adds: "A abroad, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a fall in prices mobile telephone services".
However, pressure in the direction of honest operation of the market and a fall in prices is apparently not part of the interests of the ÃOHS.
What is actually shocking is the almost touching concorde's three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if this is really a coincidence, everything naturally arises.
In the same way, a gasoline prices identical to all service stations is surely due at random and the hard struggle of competition.
"The office has not found thereon, of evidence of anticompetitive behavior, there is no reason to intervene in one way or another.
No operator has a dominant position, none has therefore a corresponding greater responsibility for its conduct on the market.
The tools needed for the opening of the mobile market to virtual operators lack probably even to the regulator of telecommunications ", said in his statement Chaloupa."
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the ÄTU, that telecommunications are, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has dominant position in such a market.
However, some law experts offer a different view of things: to be possible, the creation of a virtual network operator must be obtained each time, the consent of the operator's network.
And logically enough, mobile operator has a monopoly on its network.
Therefore, it necessarily play a dominant role in a certain segment of its business.
However, even without this argument, it should be at least disturbing to the ÃOHS three mobile operators are visibly in a similar way.
However, the complaints of many stakeholders (including the GTS Novera company, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in the negotiations with all operators.
Make fall the responsibility on the ÄTU is a tour quite common in communications, whereby the ÃOHS washes his hands of the case.
We have already met this type of attitude in many similar cases.
It unfortunately failed to pass in the novelization of the telecommunications Act, adopted recently, an expansion of the powers of the ÄTU on the field of competition in telecommunications, although many experts promised an improvement in the situation.
This, the representatives of the ÃOHS should very well know, but their interests are apparently on the other hand.
When no one is watching, it can work.
That said, the operation of a sort of nickname virtual operators, many in mobile networks Czech, unnoticed rest.
It's companies publishing their own price list of mobile telephone service, but they are public only partly.
In most cases, it is question of firms dealing with multi - level marketing.
Services telephone customized mobile are thus proposed for example by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms fail usually only to elected officials.
Magic consists in the fact that the company made to the operator of a classic enterprise client, which controls a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she gets offers of price (and others) special.
What is a problem, is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If it happens that you have raised, it could be a transgression of the contractual conditions that we would review and which could lead to a discontinuation of the collaboration with the company in question", replied to our question regarding this problem Martina Kemrova.
Nevertheless, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such activity is not reached until the leaders of the mobile operators.
Particularly in the case of the three companies mentioned it can be one of thousands of customers.
Auncun operator, however, pronounces against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms their bring non - negligible, and, at the same time profits, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Äepicky indicates possible problems: "the law allows such speculation, however, these firms are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, those - are forced to admit that the SIM card in the phone is not registered under their name, they therefore cannot dispose fully, after the manner of ordinary customers of mobile operators '. "
However, this is precisely what should seem strange to the ÄTU.
In addition, arises another question to the ÃOHS.
If the mobile operators turn a blind eye on such a procedure, why block - they create a virtual operator?
It should be added that the ÃOHS has powers relatively wide to unveil such an activity, and if it may not wish to settle for explanations of the operators, who say they have no idea that this would happen, their contractual terms prohibiting it.
When we get over the most expensive country.
As we have already mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators in the mobile market has brought a considerable drop in the price of services.
However, practically in all countries where appeared of virtual operators, conventional operators were trying, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their establishment.
The arguments used by the latter were virtually the same - a market too small, or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it is precisely at this level that occurred in developed countries, regulatory bodies, who were defending not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their clients.
Both through formal measures by informal pressure, they eventually get the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies deal with this issue like a hot potato which are disposed of by passing it to a near target.
Following the experiences that we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that the confusion in the skills is in these cases more profitable.
But let's not stick after the hatchet.
If information from behind the scenes say true and a virtual operator will soon appear among us, the Czech mobile market will resume may be moving.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÃOHS can only hardly remain impassive faced with rejection (discrimination) others.
And we continue may be to call more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best.
Listen to the four accomplishments of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
Sunday, on the occasion of the day of Czech citizenship, Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek solemnly presented the new recordings of the anthem Kde domov mÅ¯j (where is my home?).
Again, the anthem was recorded by the Orchestra of the national Theatre under the direction of JiÅÃ­ BÄlohlÃ¡vek.
We have four versions - with a solo song, male or female, an interpretation with choir and an instrumental version.
Singing is provided by KateÅina KnÄÅ¾inkova and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar JeremiaÅ¡ and Jaroslav KrÄek are the authors of the hymn arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the server iHNed.cz...
BÄlohlÃ¡vek considers the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously told Äesky rozhlas (Czech public radio), he chose for the solo interpretation of versions of singers with voices young and representative, which are marked and appreciated.
"Since the beginning, I was trying to take care that the two singers and choir have good diction, so that you will clearly understand the lyrics they sing simultaneously", he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov mÅ¯j sounds for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovske divadlo (estates Theatre) in FidlovaÄka (the Cobblers Kermesse), Czech original work of Josef Kajetan Tyl, accompanied by the music of FrantiÅ¡ek Å kroup.
It became popular and people have spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of the Tchecoslaovaquie in 1918, the first verse naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
He remained one of the seven national symbols, even after the creation of the Czech Republic independent.
How sounds the 'new' anthem.
Prague (MHD) transit will introduce Wednesday, the chip in their ticketing system.
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be entered in the history of PraÅ¾skÃ½ DopravnÃ­ podnik (the Prague Agency of transport) as the date on which will rise in the metro, trams and buses the first passengers, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will be in their Pocket an electronic coupon.

From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy coupons via the internet on the web pages of DopravnÃ­ podnik: www.dpp.cz...
More than four hundred people took advantage of the service during the morning.
Those who begin using the online store can forget permanently teller machines in metro stations, where they were until now trampling anticipation in long tails to get paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their coupon over the internet and on register on their Opencard map in one of the thirteen MÄstskÃ¡ knihovna (libraries).
"In these contact points, it is available to passengers a window with a staff trained, that will help stakeholders with the purchase by internet and, moreover, will record the coupon they bought on their map", said the spokesperson - project Martin Opatrny.
Alongside libraries, it will be also possible to save the electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the lobby of several underground stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, reminiscent of the machines to validate tickets and passengers have can - be already noticed in the Roztyly, BudÄjovickÃ¡, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and VltavskÃ¡ metro stations.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, it should be twenty-four," added Opatrny.
A PLC control the coupon instead of the driver.
Machines which will run from tomorrow, are easy to use.
Simply insert the Opencard smartcard and the purchased coupon will previously to register him - even on the map.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the surroundings of the city.
Namely in suburban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, mainly used by the inhabitants of municipalities in Central Bohemia to reach the capital.
"Trains into PraÅ¾skÃ¡ public doprava (transport integrated Prague), controllers are equipped with card readers, with which they establish the validity temporary and zonal coupons;" said control of banknotes Filip Drapal Ropid organization, which designs the Prague public transit schedules.
Peri-urban buses are equipped with card readers built into the body of the driver.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the card chip to the driver, but should also place the Opencard where indicated on the side of the box.
Therefore, the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"In the case where the passenger would need to verify the validity of the coupons saved, there nothing simpler than to request this information from the driver", completed Drapal.
Passengers who do not take peri-urban buses and not the date where expires the validity of their coupon, remember can again join vending machines, originally used to save the coupons on the map.
It is there, on the screen of the device, that will display information about the validity of their document.
The Sudetenland demanded a referendum in the USA.
The Sudeten Germans asked that Å umava is integrated in the States - 1945 United.
This follows a letter filed in the collections of the JihoÄeskÃ¡ vÄdecka knihovna (the scientific library of the South Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of the Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the States - United of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans were allegedly addressed to the president of the USA with such a desire.
This follows inter alia a letter preserved in an archive private, which is now filed in the collections of the vÄdecka knihovna JihoÄeskÃ¡.
Germans of Äesky Krumlov pray in the letter the US president of not allowing that "Å¡umavska Å¾upa" region of forests in the South of Bohemia - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - is made in Czechoslovakia.
"We understand the situation and want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that American troops come on Germany not in oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter, signed "Persons, in which the fate of the Å umava wishes to heart".
Since the rallying to Czechoslovakia is allegedly promising - by knowing the Czech national character - brutality, attitude regardless, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter pray the American president to take into its hands the protectorate of the Å umava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would give this territory to a foreign State to us, which oppresses and kills minorities and which has in no way contributed to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of the quarter of a million of the inhabitants", is written in the letter.
The alleged reason for which authors can not sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the USA doubted opinion of Germans from Å umava, would that to hold a referendum in the region to establish if its inhabitants wanted to be part of the USA, or even live under the patronage of the States - according to the authors of the letter, United.
Although the text contained in the letter may, in light of the current knowledge of the history of the after - war, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it illustrates the expectations of the Germans of the Sudetenland at that time.
While the Czech Germans were all at least glimpsing that their expulsion from the Republic issue will arise, very few of them are admitted to such a possibility.
Some waited as the - United States and the big - Brittany were going to get some type of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others believed that they would remain simply in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in Äeske BudÄjovice, confirms this.
During the war, one - ci was, as a German Äeske BudÄjovice, engaged in the Navy in the Baltic countries.
When ' at the end of the war, he was captured by the British and placed in the camp of the Holstein region capture, dozens of Czech Germans came to see learn them Czech.
"They believed that once back at home, the Czech would be profitable," said Chalupa.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war did, he said that, following the BeneÅ¡ decrees, he would be expelled from the Republic.
You think not - you pay!
An emotional campaign address drivers.
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
One way to characterize the emotive media campaign that intends to launch, Wednesday, the Ministry of transportation.
The office of Minister AleÅ¡ ÅebiÄek believes that it will discourage drivers from a dangerous driving behaviour.
This campaign costing 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, Internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage fast driving and driving drunk drivers.
But also remind them to take the safety belt before you start.
She wants especially to touch the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially the personal stories that will attack the emotions.
Also reflected the slogan "bloody" throughout the campaign.
You think not - you pay!
The sentence "you think not about" is inscribed in capital letters on the license plate.
Then, in a puddle of blood, there is the sentence "you pay".
What should symbolize that one can pay life a moment of inattention.
The spots will "haunt" the audience until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo - Saxon, where one can commonly see images with drastic images of the victims of accidents.
He believes that this will result in a decrease in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG.
The strategy of the sugar and whisk against the drivers.
"What works with drivers, it is the system of the sugar and whisk.
For them, the sugar is represented, e.g., by winning time, when they blow a red light.
The whip, it is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks have to be recalled to drivers ", said Martin KoÅÃ¡n, the psychologist of transport of hospital Na Homolce."
It is as need us information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertisements, the psychologist.
Panels indicating danger to drivers are, according to him, already less effective.
"When a static Panel that warns against danger is installed, it will probably soon merge with the environment and drivers will most notice, reported KoÅan.
Olmert would make in Exchange for peace almost all the occupied territories.
The president of the provisional Government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, spoke in favour of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including therefore the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in Exchange for peace with Palestine and the Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all the (occupied territories), or even all", Olmert told the daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), since without it, peace will not happen", he added.
He admitted that the possible refund would include East Jerusalem.
'' Who wants security in Jerusalem, and especially do not want that tractors and bulldozers to crush feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem, '' remarked Olmert by referring to two attacks in the city, in July, during which several people were killed and dozens of people injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Mount of the Temple, sacred and historical sites" located inside the old town.
"Those who wish to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This wont, he stressed later.
Retreat from the Golan Heights.
Olmert spoke also for the retreat of Israel from the Golan Heights, which is, according to him, an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with the Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of a retreat from the Golan", he pointed out.
"The Syrians know what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to renounce their current relations with the Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to give up to the supports constant that they give to the terrorism of (Shiite movement) Hamas, Al - Kaida (terrorist network), as well as that of Jihad (holy war) in Iraq ", said the Prime Minister.
Questions which arise after the accident: the stewards in the car are - they illegal?
The law ignores them; walk in a as long distance is prohibited.
In the context of the tragic accident of the bus of the company Student Agency near Padua, in Italy, the question arises if the stewards and passengers may during the journey to move inside the bus.
"If you wanted to enforce the law in a strict and formal manner, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic", said - spokesperson of the Ministry of transportation Karel Hanzelka.
The occurrence, during which killed a 22-year old hostess, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the path of the coach.
The girl was at that time unfortunately sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, it has at its disposal two other seats.
However, the coach can have an accident, or even slow down abruptly, also at the time of the steward serves coffee or distributes newspapers.
What matters is if the coach is under his sheet equipped with standing or not.
If this equipment for places standing is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
Long distance coaches Student Agency have no standing room; What was confirmed to AktuÃ¡lnÄ.cz by Radim JanÄura company director.
"This is something that we have dealt with the Ministry and, initially, it prohibited movement of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey provided that they have their own seat ", it unveiled its position.
The Act ignores the steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal prescription deals with this role."
On the other hand, no legal prescription prohibits nor to the carrier to offer services.
The law on road transport only knows the term of receiver for vehicle; It does not define its rights and duties ", adds with more ambiguity the spokesperson - Hanzelka.
Josef PokornÃ½, the Director of the Department of the movement of road vehicles, considers, on the contrary, that the law sufficiently treated the problem.
"Everything depends on the fact if the coach has in its approval permission to offer standing room."
Everything is there - in ", says - it."
Coaches are divided into urban, where there are places standing and a maximum speed limit of, long distance with standing room and a higher speed and long distance buses without standing place with the highest maximum allowable speed and seats fitted with safety belts.
As in the plane, said an expert.
Jaroslav HoÅin, security in transport expert at BESIP (road traffic safety), does not see the displacement of the stewards on board as a major problem.
"During a regular traffic, there no danger. The situation can be compared to that of the service on airplanes.
There, it is not sure when turbulence will occur and the stewardess can head banging "."
"However, where the coach would have slowed down abruptly, the laws of physics would be obviously valid.
In the same way as in a city bus or a tram.
The carrier must manage security stewards by internal requirements ", said - it and considers also that from the point of view of the law, the issue is not resolved."
JanÄura is ready to remove these services.
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer the services of stewards.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the Director does not consider their job as a profession at risk.
"However, as soon as I get the impression that it is a risky business, I will delete it.
Passengers can get their coffee and their journal to the boarding.
It would also reduce costs ", says - it."
The concern for security is the reason that gives the absence of stewards in its vehicles Director of the Asiana Alexei Litvine, which ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We have no hostesses. We are opposed from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end by a fatal accident ", he said, there is a years, Tyden.cz..
An immense tragedy has arrived.
A young hostess of the PlzeÅ region, who worked for the company for two years, was killed in the accident on the line from Naples.
A Slovenian truck probably has quite the emergency stop band without the use of flashing and it has blocked the way to the bus.
The driver to try to avoid it by means of a manoeuvre brusque, but it grazed him by his right side.
JanÄura denies that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards have been sold.
"In the case of the long-distance lines, it is not possible to book these seats, they are blocked."
The company intends to file a complaint against the driver of the truck.
For compensation for the family of the girl, the Agency will not wait the judgement of the tribunal, but with respect to financial compensation, it also relies on the culprit.
A change in the law?
Not in sight.
An amendment to the Act, which is currently be developed, since more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of transportation could provide clarification as to the movements of the stewards on board the bus.
"However, it has not resulted in a any conclusion on this point."
Truth be told, it is interested not too to buses, but rather to the points system, maximum Highway speed and the use of the laptop in driving ", says the expert HoÅin.
"The Department of transport does not consider the activity of the stewards as something which would fundamentally jeopardize the safety of the passengers", concludes - spokesperson Hanzelka, specifying that the control of the safety of coaches is under the power of the police and the office for safety in the workplace.
The Dusseldorfois hopes rest on Frankfurt.
Big words were not lacking in the letter addressed by the Steering Committee of the WestLB to employees of the House.
By a union of the entities of the financial Institute of DÃ¼sseldorf with the Deka - Bank in Frankfurt, "the central institution of the Sparkasse financial group financial markets" could be, according to the public rendered mail Monday.
WestLB would bring a "bloc of jurisdiction" coupled with sustainable productivity in such a deal.
After all, such a relationship could be decisive kick to other concentrations in the sector of the banks of the LÃ¤nder.
Here is what it looks like when a Board Committee wishes to demonstrate its capacity for action in challenging times.
Since WestLB, wounded, still undergoes strong pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal monitoring of Financial Services which only authority recently, clearly made clear to the Government of the Land of North Rhine - Westphalia that time was running out in the search for a future solution.
It is however question since some time already - also on the side of Frankfurt - of a relationship to a form any between the Deka Bank, who knows customers of Sparkasse due to their investment funds, and WestLB.
Certainly the head of the Deta - Bank Franz Waas informed presenting figures in the half end of August that he saw no sense in the fusion of the House of the Mainzer Landstrasse with a Bank of Land, whether Helaba or WestLB.
However the Board of Directors of Deka, which each half is supported and by the banks of the LÃ¤nder and savings groups, instructed the Steering Committee to conduct talks with WestLB to joint commercial activities.
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts of one - ci.
The talks however have only just starting, said - on in the financial market.
This is not the first time that Deta - Bank, which with its 3000 employees account for one of the largest employers on the financial centre of Frankfurt, comes into play when ' it comes to consolidation of the savings banks sector.
In 2003 it was believed for a while that the Deta - Bank could merge with the Bank of the State of Rhineland Palatinate and the Halbab.
Nothing emerged yet of this ternary bouquet.
Barely plans had they rendered summer public that the Government of the Land of Hessen was pronounced against any involvement of the Hellaba in those - ci.
Subsequently, two other houses no longer do is were not.
The Bank of the State of Rhineland Palatinate was attached in place at the Bank of the Land of Baden - Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there were always new negotiations on reunification of the Deka - Bank with banks of LÃ¤nder.
Finally, GÃ¼nther Merl, president of the Steering Committee of the Hellaba, was however pronounced against any commercial strategy to merge with its bank.
Apart from that, the feeling seems to spread that the consolidation of the various institutions of the public sector is particularly urgent.
Now that the election of the Parliament of the Land of Bavaria is passed, a union of the BayernLB with the Bank of the Land of Baden - Wuttenberg could materialize in the first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
Should the pressure that requires new mergers increase, potential partners elude him little by little.
In the South, it would now be a junior partner, although it has until there fared better in the crisis than banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The groupement des caisses d'Epargne et transfers of Hesse - Thuringia, which owns 85 percent of the capital of Helaba, on the other hand pulled a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB.
Would remain at the NordLB rigour.
Of such geo - strategic thinking reflects only one facet.
Another facet poses the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can match.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, namely through what business model the future capacity of banks of the LÃ¤nder should be insured, had been up there unresolved by the German group of the savings banks and transfers.
Eventually, a butchering of WestLb could have place, butchering that here is obviously not desirable.
This is also mentioned in the letter of the Committee Board in place: in any event would be prescribed by a 'total solution' for the establishment.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of some entities with the Deta - Bank still remains to be seen.
The second week - end of the Beer Festival is also known as the week - end of the Italians.
For Elena, this is the first time for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies him as a girlfriend, and so nothing is same, says - it.
Behind them, next to a barrel of five litres of beer of the Kaiser brand, stands a well-built bearded which shows approximately 200 visitors of the Oktoberfest which deep sounds his throat can produce.
Elena first tape Luca, then kisses him.
Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, the bus station near the train station Puorta nueva, four buses take this evening departure at 11.45 p.m. 'destinazione Monaco, festa della birra' arrival at 6:30.
Three buses are reserved first and foremost for the Italians, in a bus travelling bresilens exclusively.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South - Americans sing ors and near their flag already, they have already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, this isn't for the Italians.
The bus owned by Marco, who wears a long coat lined with faux fur and goggles to the large silver frames.
For five years, they go to the Beer Festival, already three sprees this year alone.
They go there at night, remain day to day, and come home at 10:30 pm.
Spend the night would involve unnecessary costs, explains Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome drink with a beer Kaiser, brewed according to the Bavarian purity, insurance law and a leader of the German speaking group - Marco did a course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses are running at night on the direction 'Brennero' Autostrada.
No beer, there is not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes quiet on the bus, passengers sleep.
It's better as well, they will still need their forces.
Breaks will be made to Bressanone and Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian registration plates are once again a break shortly before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the early morning, the Marco group arrives finally at thirty six as expected on the parking close to the square ThÃ©rÃ¨se, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and others gather, Marco is a last speech, explains the plan of attack.
First: styling of the small yellow Cap.
It is written on the left 'Beer Festival', in Gothic, and next address internet of Marco travel agency ' conoscersiviaggiando.it '. "
Secondly: 'when the doors of the beer tent open, on short', Cree Marco in the morning.
' Run! ' Run and reserve places at the bottom of the tent.
' Not to, if not blocked, and not all yellow caps on the same benches, it is necessary to distribute them in the room! '.
The mug, Cree Marco, costs $ 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the deposit!
' Show security officers that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they are parties! '.
Third: 'tonight, being income here has ten hours and half battery!' Understood?
And that's it, it's gone to the Oktoberfest.
Along the way, someone forges yellow caps to trees to find the way, panels and even an election poster of a large Bavarian people's Party.
We want to be ready for the return.
This is the second week - end of the Beer Festival, known as the 'week - end of Italians'.
There are no precise figures; talking about 50,000 who set off through the Alps and collapsed in the beer stand, 10 percent of visitors would come express to Italy this week - end.
The Munich police is reinforced by seven police officers of the South Tyrol by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross who makes a statistic on the countries where the Italians occupy the first place before the British (60 interventions) and the Austrian (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
One that is particularly popular with Italians, is the tent of the HofbrÃ¤u brewery.
Sleepless nights for the shareholders of Hypo Real Estate.
The German banking system is relatively stable, insisted the federal Minister of finance a few weeks ago only.
How lucky that the politician used the word 'respect' and he slid that German banking sector would not be spared by the movements of crisis.
Celle - ci is indeed occurred this week - end.
The financier of the Bavarian estate Hypo Real Estate (HRE), side Dax, gets a credit of one billion from a consortium of German banks to protect themselves from the market turbulence.
A person in confidence of the situation told Reuters Monday that aid credits are issued up to an amount of EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to the what it would so right.
The money comes as many private banks of banks under public law.
In the background - it company - Depfa girl who shall bear the loss.
The financier of State was, according to a newspaper article, refinanced in the very short term for long term projects for which it had borrowed money - what is no longer possible since because of mistrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank liquidity reserve had been reduced 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, the rate of own capital also slightly weakened 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current profit and net from financial transactions were, compared to the same period the previous year, fell to zero point, profits from the assignment of receivables and securities determined as well as the termination of provisions in credit operations had fallen more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
And it is only through the important benefits of the reimbursement costs of accounting downstream from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the refund interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern enterprises that gains of about 16 per cent deficit proved being moderate.
After its privatization in 1990, the former financier of State had first incorrectly speculated on real industrial appropriations, which then filialisÃ©s to the Aareal Bank.
Because what the classical State financing was not profitable enough, the Depfa had then engaged more intensely in the infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private investors and State (Privat - Public - Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the company - girl, the Hypo Real Estate must carry out depreciation that should have a hardware key which remains still enough blur effect on the calculation of gains and losses of the group.
The fact is that dividends have been cut.
Already for 2007, they had been truncated to two-thirds.
Since the purchase of the Depfa, the Hypo Real Estate is a highly important State and infrastructure investor.
It is stronger than other institutes dependent on the inter - bank market refinancing since it possesses no deposit customers.
With the bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of funds between banks has again significantly dried up, banks have accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually to a part - approximately 50 billion euros - the total appropriations of the Depfa to a short-term refinancing means.
According to a press release of the Hypo Real Estate, the need for financing of the group is covered with medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets largely out of market currently.
Other sources say that the refinancing would be insured with funds until end of 2009.
However, the Chairman of the Executive Board of HRE Georg Funke Committee explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group should more having to resort to the financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the federal institution for the Financial Services supervision (Bafin) depart from the principle that the ability of the Group Hypo Real market is now assured.
Shareholders and creditors of the Bank have more than to hope.
However, in the light of the dynamics and the weightlessness of the crisis, there is no certainty.
Moreover, it is not unthinkable that it should not use funding in its whole extent.
But the contrary nor cannot be ruled out.
After the fact that the Bank either, according to the latest releases, still at the gates of insolvency Sunday late evening, this rescue for the less provisional will not succeed to reassure the spirits either.
The share price has collapsed by 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, however, are doing particularly well.
While primarily debt barely budged, the course of second loans Flex.
Most affected are mainly the former company - daughter WÃ¼rttemberg Hypo investment fund and of course those who have a life beyond 2009.
The obligations of the Hypo Real Estate Bank previously appeared to be an alternative placement of speculation, now their value must be considered as dependent on the stability of the system international banker after the tightening net of the banking crisis and the crisis of the Institute even that brought the crisis into the establishment through the acquisition of Depfa Bank.
As long as the issuing banks, Governments and less affected commercial banks are still prepared to support the system, presumably a resorption of arrears at the time.
Or it will happen that nobody dare to hope at the moment - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But faced with unwanted renewed a partial nationalisation, the probability approaching security has now become a single well-founded hope.
This should book of sleepless nights to creditors long term on the decision about whether they should secede from their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use this what they pulled a stroke to constitute a loss carry-forward for the next years on the next stock gains capital income tax automatically collected.
Sylvana and secrets of the Bento box.
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, must report for the first day to the Highschool of Tachibana, the girls start to giggle: the German is so much "kawaii"!
That is - it - mean it?
Sylvana knows already that Word through manga - in his new trade Log, she talks of the Japan.
"The first day of the Japan course.
That is this - that I was excited.
Already the path to go to the school I was afraid.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes until the Tachibana Highschool.
I have the find the path alone, luckily I do I'm not lost.
The course start date doesn't seem to be fixed so tightly that at us in Lower Saxony.
Students appear one after the other from 8 a.m until nine hours less than twenty, a round table begins with the Professor, the "home room".
But before the course begins, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind to love at all speak before people, especially before a class of 40 students.
As I did not yet have the school uniform, I put an old skirt mother of home, as well as a shirt, the blue knee-length socks and black leather shoes.
In this outfit so I me am brought before the Panel, and tried everything correctly pronounce: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - I'm Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time - there, I was very happy to have started to learn the language there is two years.
The 31 girls in the class were all made by whispers, pouffÃ© laugh and made signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him through my manga.
It belongs to the vocabulary necessary to the survival of Japanese teens and means "cute, cabbage".
Then I myself am quickly slid into my place.
The girl next to me got me a big ironic smile, she found that it was an honour that correspondent should sit next to it.
The rest of the time was fairly quiet, but when the gong resonated, I have been beset in the rules.
Everyone spoke with better better, pouffait laugh and brought me a lot of questions - in this case, it is quite difficult to understand the Japanese English.
During the break, they were then all out their Bento.
My home mother had also made me this kind of Lunchbox - this is something really different from les MisÃ©rables en - German case.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sausages, a salad of cucumber and seaweed, fruit and some sort of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat exactly here in the Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What is certain, is that everything is really good.
Good, except may be salted plums candied, brrrr!
The Bentos are not only lunches in Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a Bento that she prepared it - even, and which is then prepared especially carefully - in the hope to be able to get a little better acquainted with the boy during the break.
I read this in my manga.
I'm curious to know if I could watch it here.
"Why the Japan in particular?" asked me my friends when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at the school in Tokyo.
I then always replied:.
"Because it fascinates me, what".
Ultimately, read manga, this is what I prefer for years.
And to better understand manga and culture located at a time, I also started to learn Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel a day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, the us and customs.
And here are given great importance.
On one side, the Japan is the country of technologies and the latest trends - on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And as everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even if Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen "."
Rats also have feelings.
A rat or a cockroach flees from the danger, is - it - mean that he also feels fear?
Neurophysicien Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
But how could - on check that he experiences the same thing when it behaves in the same way as we?
In the online "Edge" magazine, contributions are published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents a series of responses to the question "What do think - you be true without having the evidence?".
I believe that animals have feelings and other States of consciousness without that me or anyone else until now could not prove it all as it is impossible to prove that other humans humans have a conscience.
But in this case - there you can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and discussed issues of feeling or consciousness in general, we penetrate hardly passable terrain because the Hardware does not.
When a rat is danger, it's the same thing as many other animals: it is the death, leaks or attack.
Human beings humans behave in the same way, this is why some scientists infer a similar subjective experiences.
However, I believe not.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transposition of our subjective experiences in difficult animals.
One of the aspects is that circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (as a result of its participation in short-term memory and direction and execution functions).
This vast region is much more developed in humans humans and other primates and seems to be completely absent in others.
Least so for these aspects - of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal Cortex, including the awareness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being differs even other primates.
Another significant feature might lie in the linguistic nature of man: a large part of its existence being related to the language, this often means that consciousness depends on.
In this case, could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness does not depend on the language, celle - ci it would influence surely, so the animal consciousness, regardless of how it is produced, is conforms probably lot of most of our States of consciousness.
That is why it is also difficult to determine what may look like consciousness in other animals.
If this internal and subjective, can be measured, or because of this particular Hardware, analyze based on our own experience, then his observation we have big problems.
Most of my development refer to the content of conscious experiences, but exists alongside another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
Could examine the processes of consciousness of animals without taking account of their content, and that is exactly what happened in studies on the short-term memory of primates, particularly with the example of visualization.
But in this approach that was followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, it focuses more on nerve correlations of the consciousness on the causal mechanisms: the two may be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also underlines the weight of the prefrontal Cortex in the realization of the visualization.
But what in it then follows to the emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is enabled in a conscious brain of its own activity.
Which we refer to as 'fear' is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its aftermath, as the body's reactions) is hogging RAM.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially human.
From subtle degrees of feeling, related to our talkative nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize States to apply the other to us even.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio think for example that the sensations from primitive activities are born in regions of the body sensation of the Cortex and the brainstem, as Jaak Pankseep but more focused on the brainstem.
As this network is not much changed during human evolution, it could quite part of transverse sensations in any kind.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I can not contradict him, but I believe that unprovable.
Pankseep argue that what appears as fear among men and rats is likely also felt as such in both cases: how could - on check however if rats and men feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach flees from the danger, but if he feels fear?
In my view, similar behavior are not enough to prove identical experiences.
Certainly, the nervous comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, cockroaches however do not have even a brain.
But is this - that the brainstem is the origin of sensations?
And even if it could be proven that for humans: how could - they demonstrate in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps - even cockroaches (who knows?) have feelings.
But I would not know how to demonstrate.
And because their feelings likely completely differ from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuitry and the language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior as the emotional feelings of the rats.
In all cases, progress are on the map nervous insofar as we gauge the same thing in rats and humans.
As I does not explore the language and awareness among rats, or feelings, I do not know if they exist.
Could judge this as of in the short term, but I'd rather move forward rather than constantly banging me against a wall.
I am indeed a pragmatic emotional.
Platini, president of UEFA: a period of grace for the Poland and the Ukraine.
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that preparations would be soon placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The Government considers the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in the Ukraine and its ability to organize, in cooperation with the Poland, the European Championships," announced Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still much to be done in both countries "."
In the timetable of the construction or destruction stages, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts run after the deadlines.
The number of stages for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can no longer waste time.
We work at the maximum speed ", said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis."
"UEFA we constantly has to the eye".
An even more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the PZPN Polish football league was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent Director.
The Committee was meeting at the request of the Minister of sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a real danger that the PZPN will not be able to act within the rules", said Drzewiecki of the PAP Polish news agency.
"We have assured in a letter to the President of the UEFA European Championship 2012 preparations would not suffer".
Several members of the first Division League have been, already in the previous season, sentenced for handling of mandatory relegation; ultimately, the start of the League able to the be shifted at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid outraged counter - attack.
She wanted to make the promotion for a new film, talked about his private life in an interview - and now has trouble with his ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan lifted the veil on her former adulterous Dennis Quaid.
Scum - and counter - attack.
A late war of the Rose for the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in an ugly battle - light and this is known to everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan was expressed in an interview for the InStyle American newspaper on the causes of the breakdown of the marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful long, and it was very painful".
It would have been aware of the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan press for her new movie "The Women" relations - there is told the story of adultery.
The reaction of Dennis Quaid on his unfaithful husband qualification fell clearly: it would be "Monstrous", said one - in the "New York Daily News", 54 years, as "Meg outdating once again the history of our relationship and the handles".
It would be more "regrettable", that "the sentence and the upheavals that have a divorce for each child are again revived in public"for their joint 16-year-old son Jack".
While Ryan lives alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
So was its response to the coup of claw: "in any case, my life continues.
I feel happy to have a wonderful family who will best "."
Hotels and plane tickets prices fall.
In the first half of the year 2008, flights and nights of hotels were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, the flights would be even reduced up to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would again become advantageous - it is the result of a study of the provider of financial services and travel American Express.
The company analyzed its data from bookings for the first half of 2008 and has established, after a rise of prices in the first quarter, a net decrease of profits in the second quarter.
After that prices in the hotels market increased for years, the nights of hotels have already reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities examined yet of 6.9 percent on average compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 examined European cities.
From April to June, prices were however already 3.6 per cent lower than the previous year.
The trend has been clear especially in Paris and Rome, where the travellers had paid 30 to 37 per cent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would reside for American Express in the low course of the dollar which has led to a "desire to travel down from American tourists".
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London would be more affected by the fall in prices of industrial sites as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger hotels.
In the Swedish city, the prices of hotels stand with an increase of 26.3 percent, the record in Europe.
Also pricing of flights, the trend was rising in the first quarter.
Because of the increase in the price of kerosene, the economy class passengers have pay an average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long flights - mail, very fuel consumers, have even increased to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, tickets in economy class prices have dropped on average 12.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter, business class and first class however, price variations were much less pronounced.
In Germany, the prices have been dropping even more important than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had increased by 11.9 percent in the second quarter, they fell by 23.6 per cent.
German domestic flights have even been halved according to this study.
The reasons for this drop in prices would be one side economic growth weakening, says the firm.
Demand yield of the land in many of the air travel market segment.
Other hand, there is a pressure accentuated competition because of the "Open skies" Treaty that liberalises air traffic between the - United States and Europe.
Sign of the tense situation is the removal by the airlines of the routes and non - profitable, as well as the high number of airlines that have filed bankruptcy during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies in Europe alone.
HSV beat Gladbach 1: 0.
With a goal and the simple methods, the SV Hamburg becomes first in the standings.
In the Borussia, Luhukay has not managed to find a functional eleven.
By Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Landing in disaster for striker Marko Marin.
Gladbach player returned that late in the game and his lifted shot failed against the frame of the goal.
His message was precisely formulated, he was out of his lips in a persuasive manner.
Quite simply, he knew he was right.
"We need that second goal," hissed Hermann Rieger in the corridor to the dressing rooms at the Hamburg arena.
It happened not much in the locker room, the mi - time was over and most were sat down in their place.
Rieger has been for nearly three decades the physiotherapist from HSV, it enjoys a great reputation like so many former players.
And that is why his application was received at strategic places.
Coach assistant Cornelius Jol has acquiese and lifted the thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
Whose orders appear to have been similar: and make it snappy with this second goal!
The practical implementation has failed.
"Everything was not very nice to see today," confessed later Marcel Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard "wished to also be more relaxed".
This 1: 0 (1: 0 in mid - time), the Hamburg team should a strike to the head by Mladen Petric (at the 11th minute); and the fact that very low Gladbach players could not to harm the weak players in Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory", summed up marine Jol.
The Hamburg SV will celebrate this Monday its 121 years.
Already Saturday after - noon, fans celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional standings on the giant screen tables which indicated their club as the first of the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without feast.
"We know take back", said Marcell Jansen.
Doubting that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictable nature of the League first as the domination of its HSV.
The team with its committed late arrivals - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric just as Jansen vagrant FC Bayern - shape while gently, but she does not shine again.
"We need more charming and more than dribbles ', required OJL.

The dark matter influences the flight of space probes.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon leaves researchers in perplexity: matter dark influence the speed of space probes during the so-called gravitational support manoeuvres.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" flies in space.
Because of soon frozen fuel piping, cryogenic death threat.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon is cause of confusion among researchers - support gravitational anomaly.
Gravitational support is a manoeuvre of space probes, by which they get an extra boost in the gravitational field of a celestial body, the Earth for example.
Thus, the sensors can save a lot of fuel.
Search americo - European Cassini - Huygens probe used this physical trick, just like the solar probe Ulysses.
This is what amazes researchers elsewhere for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent the way you expect it according to the venerable laws of gravitation.
Moreover, irregularities appear at the level of the speed.
Probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
Christened it support gravitational anomaly.
Some experts feared that the theory of general relativity by Albert Einstein, which describes the gravitational pull of matter because of the curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still believes hard as iron that Einstein was wrong and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also close to the Earth," wrote - it.
Space researchers know of the existence of dark matter only for about ten years.
He apparently emanates from it an attraction force whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
She, on the other hand, is completely invisible, it is - to - say that it sends neither does any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
According the calculations of scientists, dark matter would represent everything from even a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free.
After 10 days at the hands of their captors, tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be freed as well as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
Sudanese kidnappers had demanded a ransom of several million euros.

The five Germans, five Italians, and the Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are doing well and are safe, announced Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants of the excursion in the desert should already be en route to Cairo.
The circumstances around a shooting before the release of the hostages still unclear: thus, the kidnappers reportedly close to put an end to the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security officer, before that the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without warning.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom ", said the officer.
It only remained to collect the hostages ", when suddenly," this surprise "has occurred.
Sudanese soldiers had shot Sunday six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and the Egypt, and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers had demanded of the Germany a ransom of six million euros; money should be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" stated that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was long overdue because the kidnappers feared for their safety.

Abuse of a stepfather "that led to suicide".
A court was told that years of abuse inflicted by his step - father led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57ans, Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after he admitted eight counts of indecent assault.
The High Court of Truro has referred that he was regularly binding its belle - girl, StÃ©phanie Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7 years.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death".
The Court was told that Ms Randle, aged 34-year-old committed suicide at her home at Mutley, Plymouth, April 1, 2007.
Child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise it had attached and bandaged before forcing her to sexual acts, while his mother worked at the pub.
Trerise and his wife were divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
Its beautiful - girl moved to Plymouth.
But the tribunal was informed that Ms Randle, assiduous volunteer of National Trust, was haunted abuses that had been imposed two times per week.
The Attorney general, Ramsey Quaife told the Court that friends had told that Ms Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, seemed since 2006 "emotionally dead", and "had lost all hope towards life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, it was found dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she committed suicide suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted the stepfather of his daughter who had also drafted a letter of confession that ended thus: "I attached it and the bandais regularly".
"I have not abused her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "you are really weird as fetishist, your victim should be certainly terrorized, especially at the age of 7 years.
"This unpleasant saga ended with the suicide of the victim.
And what even more amazing is the fact that if she had committed this gesture, its history would certainly never finished to the Court "."
He added: "I would stress in particular, as described by his father and his mother, the effects of your crime commit for years on Stephanie.
"Without those - ci, it would probably now a young woman happy, promising and successful".
Conviction for official data loss.
The Ministerial officer of the Cabinet Office that had forgotten its top-secret documents, in June on a train, will be sentenced by the Official Secrets Act, knew the BBC.
The man from the Ministry of defence was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents on a train in the direction of Waterloo.
Documents are passed into the hands of the BBC prior to be delivered to the police.
This is the least severe condemnation of this Act, without any implication of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had many people in Whitehall.
"They will have thought that this case would have remained within the walls of the Ministry of defence and the Cabinet Office" he said.
An employee who cannot be named, is charged with violation of section 8.1 of the Act, it is - to - say the clause that deals with the safeguarding of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service has suggested that the judicial officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the highly sensitive nature of his work related to the associate Committee of secret service.
The documentation he has lost contained assessments on Al - Qaeda as well as the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was then transported him to a secret location.
Companies of the building facing the Bill B & B...
British building societies could have to pay a bill of over Â£80 million, to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The Government has provided Â£14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million of depositors of Bradford & Bingleys.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies who collect money from savers, including 59 building societies.
The Director general of the Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles stated it was "irritating" to know that companies and their members will have to pay the pots broken...
The Â£14 billion loan will be refunded when mortgages from Bradford & Bingleys are unobstructed.
But those interests which will at the same time increase, will be debited each year, 700 financial companies who collect deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that 59 companies of the building are included in this list.
It is irritating to see that institutions that have had a prudent behavior... must now pay some of the Bills of institutions who were far less conservative.
Adrian Coles, BSA.
It proclaims that each company must pay an amount in proportion to the deposits that it holds, and that intermediate companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury believes that the interests of the loan will be in 2009, to Â£450.
This means that companies will have to find Â£81 million to set the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director general of the Trade Committee of the building societies, told the BBC that the decision seemed unfair.
This is "irritating" to see that the institutions that have taken a prudent behavior when the recovery of the real estate market, must now pay for the far less conservative institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, when the first Annals.
"We need to look at all aspects of this matter during the next few weeks, to assess options to avoid that the building societies and their members pay this salty Bill" said Mr Cole.
The interests for 2009 cover seven months, from late September of this year until end of March.
In 2010, it will pay the interests of the entire year, which could also double.
Given that the building societies are not shareholder organizations, their Member eventually pay higher loads, or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases up to five penny per litre.
The people of Jersey should pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the price of its milk, five penny per litre, from Monday.
It is the second price increase which succeeded an increase of two penny in February, and occurs after research carried out by a consulting firm.

. Before the February increase, the price of milk from Jersey had changed for the last time in 2002.
An ex - Pm of Bangladesh has been denied bail.
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a request for bail to the former PM Sheikh Hasina, which may well be arrested upon her return to the country.
His lawyers have said that the tribunal has refused to give him bail because of his indictment for having extorted to a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729.000,00) when she was PM.
This case is one of the many accusations addressed to him.
Khaleda Zia, the rival of Sheikh Hasina, was pardoned on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh within a few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, demanded that the provisional military Government of the country first gives him his full freedom.
Correspondents have pointed out that the terms of his release are contradictory because if it allows him to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why it could remain free on his return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The supreme Court rejected the request of Sheikh Hasina saying that it requires no deposit because she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said his lawyer Rafique - ul Huq.
"We will present an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court".
His lawyers have argued that she needed this bail to return to the country to prepare for elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina should return after October 17, said a former leader of the Awami party.
She was detained last year after the military interim Government assumed power, but was released in June to seek treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasina as Zhaleda Zia, deny the charges which they are subject.

The commission stated that, in the past, the participation of MSkyB had prevented competition and had enabled him to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement to prevent that NTL, now called Virgin Media, buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the purchase by BSkyB, ITV shares has cast doubt on the effective independence of ITV, prompting Consequently, the competition Commission to investigate.
The boss of Virgin, Richard Branson, a consumer group, and the regulator Ofcom were all contrary to this purchase.
BSkyB replied that force it to reduce its ITV shares would be unreasonable and instead was excessive - especially given that BSkyB comes to renounce its voting rights.
New investigation in the case of the U.S. attorneys.
American general counsel has appointed a special prosecutor to verify the question of the dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
Everything is born of the record of the case of the inspector general of the Department of justice, which criticized the actions of some corporate officers.
The report was critical toward the White House officers, legislators and the former Attorney General, Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of the lawyers who argue that their dismissal of political causes.
The Special Prosecutor, Nora Dannehy will now investigate to determine if the officers interviewed during the inquiry, lied to investigators, thus obstructing justice.
"Serious allegations of potentially criminal conduct, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed nor resolved", the Inspector General, Glenn Fine, said in its report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor able to force witnesses to testify, was one of its major recommendations.
The dispute begins with the radiation in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors made by the American Justice Department.
At the time, the Department stated that prosecutors were dismissed because of poor benefits.
But it then emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were not more critical than their other colleagues, which prompted some observers to assign to these dismissals a connotation policy.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Congressional Republicans, while others have refused to investigate about allegations of fraudulent vote against Democrats.
US prosecutors investigate and pursue the judicial bodies for the Government.
It is certain that they can be dismissed at any time, but may not be for political reasons.
The head of the justice department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ends up accused of being involved in the case of dismissal, and in the end, he resigned.
A number of judicial officers of the Department of justice have also given their resignation.
The Inspector General's report was highly critical of the role of Mr. Gonzales in this case, stating that it saw the "primary responsibility" of these redundancies, and eventually "abdicate" its leadership role ", succeeded remarkably in not involved in this case."
Other corporate officers, including the former collaborator of Bush, Karl Rove, have been critical for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf should be honored.
Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honoured at the Q Awards for his epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said be "honored" to get this recognition.
The song of nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album by Meat Loaf's 1977 hit.
The Awards evening is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a selection restricted to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor of Q magazine, said: "there are songs that transcend things like time and the kind, and Bat Out Of Hell in fact certainly advantage.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental section lasting nearly two minutes.
The song was in commerce in the United Kingdom, as a single in 1979, finishing in fifteenth place.
In addition, his Bat Out of Hell album remained nine years in the English charts, and was sold to more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - or Marvin Lee Aday, from his real name - has suffered from problem of health in recent years, undergoing even an operation to cure his a heartbeat become irregular, after collapsing onstage in 2003.
In 2007, strong laryngitis has forced to cancel concerts.
Then it was found a cyst in the vocal cords.
A street dark in the city, often forgotten, and may soon be up for sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
. And even some taxis veterans as well as local residents for a long time know give indications to get to Extra Place, because they have never heard to speak.
The street is located in the East Village and travels North of First Street - not to be confused with Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide for 120 long, it resembles a dusty driveway rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find on a standard atlas.
However, this street has admirers.
For example, there are Avalon Bay, the constructor of the recent buildings of luxury on First Street.
He would resurface Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to the stores and boutiques, which should open in new buildings.
Other admirers including neighbors for a long time, said be charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the latest and most ancient streets of the block.
But the Department of Preservation and development real estate of the city which manages the street, has no interest to keep.
This month -, at a meeting of the committees by owners of neighborhood, Avalon Bay and city agency representatives have drafted a proposal to allow the real estate Builder to buy Street.
But the Committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and asked a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, manager local Committee n Â° 3.
"There are few spaces belonging to the city, and we would like that the city retains Extra Place" she said.
"They could propose to restore and manage it, what else Avalon might do, but we want to keep it public".
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to repave the street and install seats, some would be also used in a cafe to which manufacturer conceded the space.
The proposal of this potential acquisition was made public at the meeting of this month - ci.
Michele de Milly, spokesperson of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to operate the street, this is not necessarily say that she wants to be the owner.
"The main interest of Avalon Bay is to dress up famous this aisle abandoned, and make it public"she said, stressing that it was the city to suggest the sale".
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation of the estate, confirmed that the city wished well sell Street in addition, stressing that the Agency's mission was to develop the property rather that manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that Extra Place this name since 1802, when closed the great inheritance of many children of Philip Minthorne was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which remained since abandoned.
The rear entrance of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, has re opened Extra instead; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo on the cover of the album of Ramones "Rocket to Russia".
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of scrap metal, rags, barrels, posters, leaves and strings '. "
Some residents, including bloggers who had already spoken of evolution to the luxury of the East Village, are opposed to the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this small humble property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rarity - a fragment of virtually identical to the city which should be damn in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who leads a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (sub - titled "The book of the challenges: A look Rue nostalgic on a city in the process of Extinction") tells the story of the city and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The new Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small cul - de - sac narrow, dark of day and night, and bounded through the doors of a warehouse in iron rust and the blinds, full logs of the week past that fly along the gutters".
A few exceptions, street still has the same look.
A short rat nimbly at the bottom of the alley near a door that once led to the CBGB, and which has now become the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, an empty bottle of beer of 22 ounces, is based next to newspapers who come just to be thrown away.
Some bystanders reported not think only rarely in Extra Place, and suggested its development.
Mr. Field, for his part, said suggests that certain felt the lure of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life" he said, "took place in dark, wet and filthy places".
The bilingual debate: Immersion in the language English.
In this part of the Supervision of the Education program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of the candidates about bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, former member of the California studies, and former Director of the Department of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co - author of the book "not as good as you thought. Why the middle class must be able to choose their school. "."
Attract the favor of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
The proposals of Barack Obama on education are an interesting example.
The campaign of Mr. Obama said that "Latino and African - American students were less likely to graduate than white students". It is a true fact.
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama education program supports in particular among many other subjects, "transitional bilingual education" for those learning English.
However, the question that arises for Obama is whether his desire to achieve a bilingual education which promotes education in class of languages other than English, will in addition to its interest to eliminate the differences.
Take for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students of this school are overwhelmingly Hispanic and low income.
More than a third of students, consisting of many newcomers, studied English.
Among the students of the CM1, 100% have passed the 2008 math State exam, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students have passed the exam of English - language - arts.
This incredible success was achieved through an additional ingredient that advanced by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street established analyses, practice, a constant assessment of abilities as well as an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and this is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, principal of Sixth Street, this school introduced the English language "full immersion" instruction.
Total immersion in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in the statement.
Melle Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, has affirmed to me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months after, if you go without its class, you would have had no chance to identify".
"It works, she observes,"it worked for us".
Mr. Obama should - it not take example of the Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools composed mostly of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results achieved by this school speak for themselves but policies on education within his party (the National Education Associations support long bilingual education) and his huge support for bilingual education, obscure prognosis of the response of Mr. Obama.
Although it is favourable to the fact immigrants learn English, Mr. Obama has recently considered this issue as insignificant, when he proclaimed that we need to stop all argue about the wording of the laws in the English language.
"On the contrary, he said,"you must make sure that your child speaks Spanish".
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate differences, then it should consider carefully, education models that work, rather than disdain them or consider them as insignificant.
NET fall of oil the new concerns of the world of the economy.
The oil prices have dropped significantly Monday, because people fear that the financial markets rescue plan, does succeed in reviving the economy.
Crude oil futures have fallen 7 per cent arriving at 99.80 $le barrel. The Mercantile Exchange in New York, when sales of this morning.

At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg Governments have nationalized party the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts have said negotiations frantic this weekend, concluded with the Rescue Agreement "appear to have failed to revive market".
While the economic situation is dÃ©tÃ©riorasse, the demand in raw materials, including oil, should slow down.
"The prospective global equity, rate, interest and exchange markets became uncertain" wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a letter to their investors "."
"We believe that raw materials cannot escape from this contagion.
"In regard to raw materials, our worries most pressing is that of understanding how far the American virus is broadcast - it globally and in particular in China".
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, given falling oil consumption due to the slowdown of economic growth, were therefore forced to decrease of hundred 20for, forecasts of prices for petroleum and gas for 2009.
The feast of the Second time decisive for the improvement of the team Record.
After spending during these past eight seasons, over time that anyone in uniform the Jets Shaun Ellis, the Defender thought had seen it all.
He watched the second time, when the Jets turned a 0-0 in an explosion.
"I never saw nothing like this" said Ellis.
The second time began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals have badly played under dark clouds.
Then the quarter back Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles for a touchdown from 12 yards, precursor to an afternoon during which their relationship has made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for yet two other touchdowns, the first when a back corner is dropped and the second 10 seconds mid - time.
"I am not out of my zone" Favre said about all his passes to Coles.
"It is a mediocre player".
"We communicate extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles played catch, the defense beat the quarter back to the Cardinals, Kurt Warner.
Kumkum Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards up the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens left to escape the ball because of Warner.
Last change, the loss of the ball by Bowens, might well be the most charming event.
The Cardinals took control of possession during the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a goal from 20 yards taking advantage of 34-0.
It was best that the Jets have been able to mark time.
"The coach of the Jets, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said" the second time or the third? ".
When we told him the two - the Jets missed 21 indisputable points in third time - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I most enjoyed the second time the third."
". Many points have been marked in a short time".
Gebrselassie rested, more than his world record.
Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie has again proved worthy of his best runner of the century, after beating his own record of the world in the marathon in Berlin Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory in 2:03:59 of an accommodative race on the flat, Gebrselassie broke 27 seconds its record of 2:04:26, played year last in Berlin.
At 35 years, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, the 1600metres of the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie had breached the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - can be exaggerated in the eyes of today, â that the air pollution increases his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect - sunny weather conditions, 48 degrees at the start, 55 on arrival-Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of a mile in 4 minutes 43 seconds.
Racers track like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, all two Kenyan, converted into runners, have contributed to the decline of the record for the marathon for more than two minutes in last 10 years, since 1998, when the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05.
After the victory of Sunday, Gebrselassie has told reporters, have suffered from calf cramps two weeks before, and have missed training for a week.
It is obvious that rest allowed him of remaining bright, but not rust.
"I'm so happy", he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I me am delivered there last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the best ".".
He criticized - especially at the Kenya, rival is African of the Ethiopia-to have too orchestrate his races, avoiding the global Marathon stars, counting on hares as if they were in a competition of track, and whereas most world records that the meaning of the competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie capabilities as a long-distance runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. halfway.
Two runners elite kenyans, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after of leading have disappeared.
A little more than three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final ascent to detach from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis is comes third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now citizen German, completed a remarkable year getting the 7th time of 2:19:19.
English Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36 years old Mikitenko, surprised everyone, won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She could not participate in the Beijing Games due to a hypothetical evil back, but promised to win in Berlin, his third marathon, improving his personal best by almost five minutes.
She ran that recourse to a clever strategy, leaving the Group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners take a nice advantage, exceeding then about 18miles Â½ after.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia came second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenya, finished third in 2:25:01.
In a town apart, the pride and the events of black life.
Hidden in the development of its huge park, a few miles from the Sun, the bright and giant Orlando, lies a quiet town where the pride and complications of the afro - American experience are born.
"Eatonville, first fully black to integrate city, childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, this description she made in 1935, is more easy to do today". The city the-five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of guavas, two schools and no jail "."
It has now become a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the Zora Festival which is held every year in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in many ways, became the city it describes - tourism thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tourist guide published by The Depression - era Federal Writers ' Project - remains a place apart.
It is also independent, worthy, and private that it was already in the 1930s, when Hurston told the black rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share his true thoughts with the white man, who "we knowing if little, does not know that he has lost".
Even if it is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who also relied on an open dialogue on the theme of the race, many here remain cautious look from abroad.
"We are very cautious about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, age 59, resident has always been and the oldest parishioner of the city.
"It must be consistent with the reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historic to a takeover of power of blacks as well as a community of almost 2400 people where the poverty rate is twice the average national.
It comes from a central point, but an example of rural southern black culture - sometimes disdained, other times acclaimed - that recalls the birth of American slavery.
This could explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The image of Eatonville interest born with Zora, that everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world through books sincere, full of dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "" Their Eyes Were Watching God "(1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed this city, located just off of Route 17, a road that runs through the center of Florida, often forgotten, that ends up in chapter of black history and the human drama.
Bold as a bass drum in both life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store property of the first mayor of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, which was then divided into several private parties.
"Past the road on the left", - she writes, "you will find the modern public school Brown and white, with its gardens and these well-preserved playgrounds which Howard Miller was always careful, although he knows barely read and write.
She also made mention of the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of any kind as well as everything that can be used to pass people.
So, in barely one hundred words, Hurston associa Eatonville at a Government car but also illiteracy, remarriage and sex.
Of course, Fodor was not so.
It was not actually a portrait everyone appreciated.
Zora has well described the reality "said Ella Dinkins, 90 years, one of the girls from Johnson that Hurston has immortalized," citing colorless songs, interpreted by men who rented their beauty.
She added: "some people did not appreciate".
We always remember Hurston as someone lively and eccentric, frequently returning after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston was usual in town without warning, aboard a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and was wearing pants here, where even today, we're proud of the traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed at her.
"People were always happy to see Zora" he said.
But he added in addition, rocking in his chair of rear patio overlooking Lake Sabelia, there where Hurston was certainly baptized, qu ' "she never stayed too long".
Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and his books were out of production.
Eatonville and the world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was once a star of literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman in the Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a tomb, in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
At Eatonville, no great commemoration, or plate for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or the legacy that she offered the world "said ValÃ©rie Boyd, author of" Wrapped in Rainbows,"a Hurston biography published in 2003.
A crucial moment came in the late 1980s.
Public officials from Orange County wanted to move a highway to five lanes in the city, to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, main street, two lanes of the community.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the western corner of the city.
The proposal was made while Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute on the mixture of races led hatred at the doors of the community.
"At this time, a band of white youths came launch oranges or objects against the people sitting on the side" said Mr. Franklin.
"A lady is even deceased.".
They launched a watermelon from their car "."
In a letter from 1955 addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the application of the Supreme Court aimed at forced integration, setting its decision in Brown v. Board of Education 'insulting rather than glorifieuse of my race'.
The residents proclaim now that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, while positive in some respects, diluted Eatonville cohesion and a weakened the confidence of young people.
"Black children were accustomed to be embraced - I remember it well - it was kissing our master in the morning, and evening also" said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and Chief Director of the safeguarding of the community of Eatonville, a non profit group.
This lasted, she added, until the moment where teachers and students came more of the same place.
"You do not kiss your white teacher because it is white - I mean that there is here a cultural dividing line" Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, moreover, helped create space for good of other Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who went in addition to the harm, such as she, army of joyful own trust and the guidelines such as: "How can - they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!".
Beyond me "."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited the unmarked grave of Hurston and began to fight to revive his reputation.
Five years later, acclaimed on Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, the thus make US cannons.
The highway project arrived just at the moment where the most famous daughter of Eatonville regained its appeal.
And this time - ci, Hurston's old neighbors consider a Finder.
The community began to organize a festival Hurston demonstrating the catastrophic consequences that would bring this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the inauguration of the festival two years after, and much return in January, commemorating the.
After many years, the told rejected the proposal from the highway.
"The fiasco of the motorway to five lanes, extremely fast, a real civic pride" said Melle. Nathiri.
Miss Boyd summarized all declaring that "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory against the project of the motorway allowed him to change his own image.
Persons non-resident, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who attends our Church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville is classified historic town since 1998.
A library mono theme (renamed well obviously Hurston) opened in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, repave.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it may at any time consider himself a back back street during a rainy day summer, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the years 1880.
(There are now 90 percent of blacks).
The foreigners coming to discover the history of Eatonville, its raison d'etre, are still treated with caution.
We must ask permission for most interviews, and certain things- like the walls of the old church in Eatonville, painted by the white man, showing black men in the fields - should not be photographed.
In Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a courageous teacher and who has a weakness for bright red, many still fear that their insular community is well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride is emerged.
Young people in particular, tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, neither better nor worse, but also proud, creative, coattails, crazy and mixed than other racial and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection that one hears in the voices of the nephew of Mr. Franklin, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for local government or for the Police forces, who are in need of additional forces.
And even for the youngest, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon 11, twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned correctly the Eatonville description.
"Most people who spend this area there, will think:" oh, this city is nothing compared to other 'Alondra Kenon said after mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate the history, it is a very beautiful town '. "
Here in New York, all fluent in finance.
However, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stood away from the kiosk and the giant TV screens at Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the eye of the cyclone.
Never they might think that in offices in glass and honeycomb at the top of their head, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, spend the worst "day of work at the office" since the crack of 1929.
The deliverymen continue to sneak up on the sidewalks, with their wagons and their trays of muffins for matinieres meetings.
Latino always lag between establishing residential buildings, like mules, fifty luxurious shirts hung on a yoke on his shoulders.
Office workers continue to queue up to buy their matinier sandwich vendors, and it is always impossible to find a taxi between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. on weekdays.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to go to open a new savings account.
Fortunately I was scheduled to work in late afternoon, as I discovered to my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, a score of people queuing.
Not in front of the box office cashiers, or to withdraw from the case or make a payment, but before the customer service counter, where the usual customers ordered their checkbooks, tourists asked branch for the Macy store, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those before me, I would learn later from Starr, all my "licensed personal banker", were lining up for the same reason as me.
Not the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from savings known as thrifts (such as a building society) accounts, credit associations, and the type of savings local and their subsidiaries which work only in a State, who say treat customers like family.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
These days, Washington Mutual, a bank with a capital of 327 $a recourse had to the trustee in bankruptcy, and while New Yorkers returning home for the weekend this Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, 440 $millions worth of savings accounts, like seeking a buyer to save.
Office and store clerks that are before me, frightened of another potential debacle, have transferred their money to a bank that seems reliable, or one that makes the most of rescue on Wall Street.
Of New Yorkers any have become very familiar in the world of finance in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the Bank which went bankrupt, and its Director general Dick Fuld lean with the same familiarity that she would have to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the janitor in the uniform of my building, changed the topic of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or supplies of my merchant of fruits and vegetables.
She told me, following my visit to the Bank. "I put all my savings into the market of monetary funds.
"I have changed, I do not want to take any risks."
Muslim tombs desecrated while the Austria is swinging to the right.
Heinz - Christian Strache, who gave up the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of Belgian right Vlaams Belang party, take part in an event to present the Organization of "cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs depicting mosques striped in red.
The Police accused the wing extremists to have desecrated a Muslim cemetery Austrian, the weekend of the victory of political parties of the extreme right in the general elections of the country.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the cemetery of Traun, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning. This is according to the police, an organized action.
Offenders were painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as the star of David; detectives believe however that this could have been done to disguise the sense of hatred of extremists against Muslim immigrants.
This accident could - it be somehow linked to the elections.
An Islamic community spokesman said to be "deeply shocked" at the announcement of this desecration, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan that comes to an end.
The Austria think seriously to find his courage, following its oscillation to the right in the parliamentary elections yesterday.
The two extreme right parties which swept almost 30 per cent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, led an anti immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even seen critics as xenophobic.
Heinz - Christian Strache, the head of the Freedom Party, which won more than 18 percent of the votes, has campaigned against the port of the scarf and the burkas, and has even expressed his opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke d ' "a European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
The two parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would constitute a political symbol of Islamization of the Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out just after the elections, defined the right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, as worried about their future in the European Union.

"I photograph the master off the stage to capture elements of his character" GÃ¼nther Bauer - photographer.
Heels or clothing of Christmas book.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tension to get the look relaxed the man or the woman.
On the one hand the artist.
On the other, the person.
Inseparable except in the privacy, in these unknown moments from the general public, where we discover intimate gestures and stolen glances artists who do not bother to go on stage.
German GÃ¼nther Bauer mix in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of a few staged with singers, dancers and guitarists with this lesser-known side of the artists.
In this project, the photographer takes over the iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programming of the month of the Flemish photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day," explains the creator, which clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after seeing the pictures, the viewer realizes that it is not the typical images of artists on stage."
These people photographed "dans la rue" are artists capable of transmitting on stage of the passion, sadness, joy... captivating the public.
To capture moments of personality of these artists do not make pictures on stage.
They have a personality and a unique character.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera of the moments of the stars of flamenco personality "."
With the festival "Popular song of Mines", Bauer began in 1997 a journey to photograph the singers, guitarists and dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits which, thanks to the choice of camera and equipment, says classic photography.
The implementation of various stylistic means breaks with the classical side of the image, giving it a modern twist, this reflects the perception of the flamenco according to Bauer: "Music with traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not dance or singing in itself, but the personality and the character of the artist who captivates the audience with his art..
Research of the essential and the magic has been the constant of this work are presented these days in El FotÃ³mata Gallery.
The stars of flamenco as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from approximately sixty-ten photographed artists.
The project has turned into an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book collection of portraits at the gallery.
Passion for portraits of Bauer led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of old sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves photographing portraits of people, know and be able to enter their lives for a moment more or less long.
I believe that in photography a portrait is the hardest kind.
You're in front of people, characters that sometimes you don't know or that leave you just a few minutes to make a picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try my ideas to become reality "."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco which is entitled "Flamenco - people", was exhibited at the Gallery El FotÃ³mata, located at number 20 in the rue de la Mata (parallel to the poplars of Hercules Street) which will be open until October 16.

'Sangre de Mayo', the daring bet of Garci.
In inspired by the stories of Benito PÃ©rez GaldÃ³s, JosÃ© Luis Garci rÃ©crÃ©e the famous battle of the Spanish against the french in "Sangre de mayo", which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with nearly 15 million euros of budget.
The filmmaker has tried "to stage the many characters and to illustrate the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim GutiÃ©rrez and Paula EchevarrÃ­a at the head of the long list of actors.
The film lasting more than two hours and a half ", Sangre de mayo" will make its release in cinemas next Friday, which later became a television series for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
Great admirer of literature of GaldÃ³s, JosÃ© Luis Garci ensures realized with this "a childhood dream" shoot through Esperanza Aguirre, who entrusted him three years ago, turning a commemorative film for the two hundred years of May 2 Madrid, something which he has always agreed when the narrative held to national historical facts.

But the filmmaker regretted not obtaining financing as for movies "Captain Alatriste" or "Goya's ghosts" - more than double that obtained for "Sangre de mayo", - because he was unable to shoot a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio ValcÃ¡rcel, with whom he collaborated throughout his career.

Four time candidate to the Oscar (he won a), Garci considers that the three films candidates representing the Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood ", Sangre de mayo" ", seven french pool tables" and finally the winner ", blind sunflowers", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which deserves to be better known", it said.
With this film Garci is not expected at a price.
"At first you think you work for posterity, then do you realize that you work for prosperity, and now you will happy to make a film and more," says Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle BayÃ³n begins in the skin of the Sevillian Tortola Valencia dancer.
A Sevillian dancer will pay tribute to a dancer also Seville.
Carmen TÃ³rtola Valencia, daughter of a catalan father (Florenc Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the District of Triana and who at the age of three will go to London to live with his family.
It was a free dance dancer and specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer of the liberation of women, as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
It was Buddhist and vegetarian and argued for the abolition of the corset which prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman that has marked the history of dance in Europe of her between - two - wars, has fascinated Isabelle BayÃ³n.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter proposed me to interpret the Sevillian Tortola Valencia dancer and it seemed incredible".
According the dancer, "we are not trying to tell his life but to translate his way of thinking.
The titles of his dances have me thinking about flamenco.
Thus, "the dance of the Butterfly" made me think of a Cuban popular dance and "the dance of the serpent" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to its own ", she says.
The staging is done through two outstanding contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will again sing Isabela in one of his shows, as he had done in "La puerta abierta". and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who was exceptionally well wanted to collaborate with that was his pupil.
"Matilde transforms Tortola in a mature character.
I am pleased because she agreed to play a role in my work and honors me with this '. "
The staging was also thanks to the musical composition and the guitars of Jesus Torres y Paco Arriaga, to the popular song by Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de MorÃ³n; El pÃ¡jaro percussion, as well as Rafa El Viola Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra JuÃ¡rez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were considered to be divas".
This work tells, in a way, the life of this woman who is is exhibited in so distant places, especially for the time, as in India, the States - United, or in Russia, but also in Europe, since it was habitually resident in London.
"I wanted the recall because I think that it is these women who have enormous influence in their time and now nobody knows and does his work," said Banerjee.
The show will begin at 20.30 at the Lope de Vega theatre.
The publication of the 'Journal of a recently married poet' finds the triennium.
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "recently married a poet log" in the St. Stephen's Church in New York, place where Juan RamÃ³n JimÃ©nez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "triennium Zenobia and Juan RamÃ³n" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the granting of the Nobel Prize for literature and their deaths.

America please less without Paul Newman.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was part of "."
This sentence is the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of malice", and illustrates the despair of American cinema, and throughout America, face the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had trouble getting an Oscar.
He turned more since 2007.
Everyone knew that he was sick.
This has been a blow for everybody.
"Sometimes one feels more than any expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were best through its existence".
Nobody was scared to go silly or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of cinema and the homeland died during a particularly dark period, where terrorists and stock markets scare, the esteem of Americans fell well down, desperately seeking grounds to dignity.
When times are so hard and no reason to live, there are human beings humans than admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone, it embodied an ideal of beauty and truth.
He has been the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of causes lost and defeated, as the Foundation for the anti-drug fight created in honor of his elder died following a drug overdose and creating its own brand of organic food.
It was a victory for a country that took the penalty to be imposed against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The latest James Bond, Daniel Craig French found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, the Oscar winner Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the peak of his career.
The bad boy arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to appoint Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"It placed us the bar high" was George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today trying to break through the screen as did Paul Newman: being very decent and having a private life serious and far from the objectives.
This isn't always easy or possible in the media jungle of our days.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married 50 years Joanne Woodward, whom he was faithful even if opportunities were not missing him for not being.
"But why should - I eat a hamburger out of my home if I have a steak in my fridge?", had - he used to joke.
At the sky, he assisted with pride meets his daughters with his fans on Earth, something that is not so usual in America.
"Among all the great roles that he played, he was never as proud as the devoted husband of the love father of the great - attentive father and philanthropist", say - it.
Madrid in the race for the Organization of the Olympic Games of 2016.
And Yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can host the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But me I wonder if we are ready.
If we take the example of the race yesterday: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever participated.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, celles - ci would subject a playoff note.
But examine everything in detail and from the beginning.
The errors begin with the withdrawal of bibs, forcing you to go ahead.
This is not bad but if they make you move it would be better that they give you everything (including the electronic chip for racing).
And no.
They were doing you go there - down only to take the bib (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise!, he had only the size ' is for the second Jersey error, because I need a size XL).
What kind of world do we live in?
Is - it this because of the crisis that they have decided to buy that small size with less fabric and the suddenly cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened the day of the races.
Apart from the fact that it should go very early to remove the chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, Furthermore, must leave his bag at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions have started and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal has been worse.
In addition, rain accompanied by waiting longer than 40 minutes during which occurred the rebellions, and the onslaught of the hut.
I believe that around 500 people have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, are not even in the classification with the exact time, because the chip they have given me that, I think, has not marked correctly departure.
Of course, if they asked me to cite an example of a perfect race, celle - ci me especially would not come to the idea.
So I believe that we can still dream of becoming the host for the 2016 Olympics city.
Microsoft seeks a (virtual) receptionist.
The conference on the emerging Technologies of Microsoft MIT was presented a new system for the recognition of image and human interaction, a species of Artificial Intelligence with low intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks, like calling a taxi (or in the Microsoft case, a shuttle to get around the campus of the company) in response to what was asked in a conversation.
With a camera and a system for the recognition of forms and faces, this "receptionist" may know how many people there are in place, that they are - including to remember what positions they occupy - listen and hear key words from their conversations.
But also be grouped by conversation groups.
In the video presentation, the receptionist detects a third-person but she understands that she does not belong to the group which is talking with her and does not part of the company.
She asks him if she is here to visit someone and she told him that she will respond to him in a few moments.
All this without blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course this is the future.
Now the company has other things on which to focus, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked in addition to a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer associated programmes.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery as Microsoft, version after version, has not been added functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change in strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operational system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that Google Chrome is the first step on the part of Google to compete with Windows.
Several people have rightly pointed out that a Web browser is not an operational system.
The operational system will always be necessary because it is the indispensable basis for the hardware and the software to include.
It occupies the same function as your wife or your husband when you say something to your beautiful - mother.
This is true.
It will never go away but we must see the 'death' of the operating system not as absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People make less and less attention to the operational system but more and more to the Internet browser.
Is turned on the computer just to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than to browse windows.
Which are half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can do more can do less.
And Windows 7 will contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy months crowded, less complex.
For the moment, Microsoft is more interested in the launch of its own online services so that they become finally an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The photo in this article presents, was taken earlier this month in one of the rooms reserved for employees of Microsoft in Redmond.
On the drinks dispenser, a poster asked to use their own search tool - 'your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay has occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not come out at the beginning of 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will surely try to launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows phone 7.
Phone, after all, more and more looks like a computer.
But the launch of Android being late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dear.
The fabulous Marcel.
Pablo Picasso endorsed it on the French Riviera, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in the 'blood diamond' of Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in 'The Godfather' of Francis Ford Coppola and made part of the holding of the association of gay muscle.
And if we enumerate all her appearances, could also cite this mustachioed Beefy raising weights in a traveling circus.
This is not just a simple male body cotton, contoured and sleeveless shirt.
The English the calls 'tank' but Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles stands out among all others.
First of all, by its name flamboyant - although it is known as 'Marcel' - that has to do with the sport because it takes the name, according to legend, Boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' is distinguished from others by its excellent cotton, unisex cut, its distinctive logo and small (barely recognizable) Belgian flag that the best-known singlets were in the neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand produces not only only the tank tops.
But it produces also the sweat - shirt, retro boxers, the cardigans in cashmere, cotton, babies, mini pants - shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of the Sub - clothing.
Although it is a pity to wear only as under - clothes.
They have too much luxury.
"I want to be a young mother; the candidate don't care".
His enormous resemblance to his sister has not prevented him to develop his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take very seriously their new activity in fashion.
According to Monica, they are not only beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
She was present at the promotion made by the brand Mango in Paris at its new headquarters but as well as the presentation of the most important awards of fashion that the Spanish house brokers.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tells - us what you do in Paris.
I am here to present the new collection my sister PenÃ©lope and myself have created for Mango for the new season autumn - winter, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
A very intense day but, at the same time, exciting, awaits us.
On what basis your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 1950s and 60s delights us and we look much for our collections.
I love wandering in the city and observe the women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do often.
Dancer, actress and designer, you are a very versatile woman: is not it?
I think so but ultimately all is joined and these activities have many things in common.
Since I was tiny clothes I liked; I wanted to go to my grand - mother to look in the cupboards of my aunt and see his clothes.
It was awesome, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my way of dressing.
Dancers like much dressing for the courses and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you pays the clothing it is at this time that you really put you in the skin of the character.
Suddenly, everything is connected.
You had there not long 30 years: that it was hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30 years delighted me.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoy life with fewer problems.
The biological clock does not make me afraid.
I did all the things that I wanted to do since childhood and that gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So, think you become a MOM?
Of course, I want to become a MOM because my body asks me, and Furthermore, I want to become a young mother; I don't want to lose it.
With respect to the candidate, I don't care.
What I will do is give a lot of happiness to my son and raise him with much love.
Just - in film, you expect different movies that you have shot the last year come out.
It's true, I hate that they come out.
Me who am a woman of the theater, I'm very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now, but of course this is not possible.
I hate that kind films 'Ãºltima hora' and 'En busca de Cristo tumba'.
See what you think...
A few days ago you did start on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, is not it?
Do not say it!
I am not mounted on the bridge to the manikin.
Quite simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I know her since quite a lot of time, to invite me to attend a parade of charity for its association for support to women and the clothes we exhibions - I in London exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold at auction to raise money for the NGOs of Naomi.
People that Naomi is a tender-hearted person.
They say so much about it, I know, many things are not true.
In addition, this so good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She got asked to scroll for a noble cause, but if she had me ask to handstand, I would have done anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women of the third world.
Repeat offenders of the drinking and driving should install the 'alcolock' system.
The Minister of the Interior wants that driver who has had more than three administrative sanctions for drink, has to install in his vehicle a system that prevents from starting the vehicle in a State of drunkenness, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and it now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is seen as a pilot project which will last one year.
Its aim is the reintegration of the driver by offering road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State for road safety but also the General Directorate of road safety and the technological Institute Foundation for the safety of the automobile will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once in a State of drunkenness, takes over the car.
The alcolock avoid this because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures alcohol in the breath and prevents from start the vehicle if the driver is blowing not before; or when the alcohol level of the driver is higher than permitted.
Its cost is greater than 1,000 euros and is the responsibility of the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of the offences in the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people every year.
This measure is only to administrative penalties for two reasons: to deal with these behaviors before they turn into criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be made through ordinary channels but, however, the reform made by criminal requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any form commercial, although some industrial vehicles and service already has one on an experimental basis.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of deputies will vote an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party which proposes to install this system on school buses as has been done in France.
At the Mexico without ' peep - toes'.
At 5.40 p.m. precise official scheduled time, the aircraft of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling landed in the presidential Hangar of the Benito JuÃ¡rez of Mexico DF airport.

There is surely no place more appropriate in the world to introduce a price of Paris fashion and there is surely not more extraordinary living artist and good live Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the BotÃ³n - Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of the new talent in fashion.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of 300,000 euros.

With as table nearby the extraordinary family Chagals, the presidential table prepared by Mango, still appeared to be more spectacular.

And to top it all, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to booksellers on 30 September.
Wake up - morning saddens us almost when it rings each morning at 7 o'clock, but it's worse still when we think of the restless pace imposed on us by the current life.
The bureau stands for voltage and the computer's back pain.
Stress represents the evil of the 21st century.
But there are one or two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But 1001, or one of more or one less.

If the adrenaline does not run in your veins to restore your body's balance and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit in the sofa, disconnect from his mind and focus on the reading.
Talking in his sleep.
A few children speak during the night.
I do not refer to those who are waking up very awake telling something that happened the day of before, but children who speak during their sleep.
The first time that this happens it may surprise you, but in reality it has no importance.
It is a benign alteration of sleep called somniloquy.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
It is sure that there is more than one who speaks during the night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or on a more regular basis (every day, once a week, once a month...), the day after the child will remember nothing.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often related to other alterations in sleep as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (bedwetting do) or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As said before, they can also be associated with very high fevers, in situations of stress or excitement.
Anyway it is a little-studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also highly variable.
It may be that he speaks with a small quiet voice, with isolated words, whispers or shouts, tears, long speeches...
Where the somniloquy becomes busy, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist to verify if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to obtain an explanation to this problem.
We said that it is a benign alteration, it is why it has no treatment, unless it is linked to another alteration of sleep which can be treated (for example, if it is related to a sleep apnea or stress).
What we can do is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore seek quiet games and avoid programs or dramas that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children difficult to relax, and relaxation techniques can be used to help calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the somniloquies appear try to stay calm.
Remember they are harmless for the child and the next day he no longer what remembered happened.
Useful tips.
Do not wake.
It is unnecessary because it is unconscious and you rÃ©veilleriez.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and rests therefore.
Remember only if it proves very distressed several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what it says (which is not normal), do not have the temptation to question him for information.
You will get nothing, because while sleeping, he is not aware to be able to organize his thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you won't know what it is dreaming, be careful suddenly to the way in which you interpreting the information and the conclusions that you draw.
Never tell the child that you can question him during the night to know its secrets.
Not even in jest.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, do not worry, this is nothing short of well wicked, this is one episode which lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... Finally.
Illhaeusern finally found the way to victory on his land after a long period of scarcity.
Without making a great match, the yellow and blacks were created many opportunities and have managed to turn one for the gain of the match.
The pace was not very strong during this meeting where attackers have struggled to express themselves.
After a first attempt of Captain visitor Kauffmann who close the skylight on a shot from afar, Illhaeusern was going to take lightly the ascendant and in turn Florencio from afar, then with Hirn above, Roman of the tip of the foot, or even Diebold came tickle the defence of Dannemarie.
In front, was block midfield and were allowed just the stirring Rakan at the forefront of the attack.
The beginning of second mi - time was going to be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and temporal Dannemarie, and after the opening of the score for the Illhousiens by Marais, well positioned to resume a ball pushed back on a first attempt of Diebold immediately (53rd ').
But the scorer Illhousiens cannot enjoy happiness long and will have to return to the locker room about 12 minutes later and leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to enjoy and will pose big problems to an eleven illhousien that just fell a little to "compact" his defence, apart from in the latest seconds of game where, after a big kerfuffle, the ball passed very near the cross.

But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the national fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen drop nothing" and "do not want to move to Paris", announced for example Liliane Cariou, the Chairperson of the Committee on Fisheries of Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who don't pay taxes on diesel fuel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but believe that break-even point of a vessel is reached with a less than 0.30 euro per litre diesel.

Obama, winner at the first televised duel points.
In the first debate on Friday between the two candidates to the White House succeeded another about that, John McCain or Barack Obama, has prevailed.
Not surprisingly, Republican and democratic campaign headquarters declared their own victory in this televised duel which would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that the benefit of John McCain, although that Honourable, has not been enough "brilliant" to halt his decline in the polls in five weeks of presidential.
The Gallup Institute, which a poll published Saturday gives Obama a lead of five points (49% against 44% for McCain), considers that it is the Democrat who fired his own.
Among undecided voters, who are the ones that count, Obama emerged victorious for 39% of respondents, while 25% of them give the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead Thursday with a good performance expected of his running mate, Joseph Biden, to the first and only debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake of the Sub - estimate."
She has good instincts ", however warned Bill Clinton this week - end."
Septuagenarian McCain has never ceased to put forward his indisputable experience in foreign policy, while stressing the "naivety" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face - to - face.
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that"... He charged repeatedly.
"I do not believe that Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to be president", he also assured.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican television advertisements.
Obama was, pointed out that it represented the future.
Without be disassembled, it is shown concise and precise.
He highlighted its ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the States - United in the world.
"McCain has still not understood, while Obama, if", replied, this week - end, a democratic spot accusing the Republican of not having taken the measure of the impact of the crisis on l ' "American Street".
"During the four - twenty - ten minutes of debate, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you, denounced Obama, yesterday, before 20,000 personnesrassemblees for an electoral meeting in North Carolina in the pouring rain.
He did not even uttered the words "middle"or 'workers' "class. The financial rout clearly benefit Obama, who is regarded by the Americans as the most likely to save the economy on the brink.
"The coming week could be a decisive turning point", felt, yesterday, the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a veteran of the Clinton administration, compared the "good economic instincts" of Obama to those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle "is the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that it would still reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the ups and downs of Wall Street, the Senator from Illinois has also been reported that the realization of a possible energy independence of the country by the promotion of renewable energies was his first priority, with the establishment of a system of insurance - health.
McCain, he wanted to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.

Minsk, "you noticed that there's an election, you?".
Young people and opponents protesting Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject to forward the results of the legislative elections.
Hundreds of Belarusians gathered Sunday night immediately after the close of polling stations on the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislative elections.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people came to protest against the power of president Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some admit to having not even vote: "what good, since they will do what they want from my voice", said a young.
They do not believe that the regime which did well to foreign observers to resume language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turning point.
Sanctions, including the ban on visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered to be own by the observers.
They have not been it according to the opposition.
"We have been kept away from electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the recount," lamented Yuri Potemkin, the spokesperson - of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous group of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change, says Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate of the opposition in the presidential election of 2006 and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and with us, it is the Executive power.
If members of the opposition in Parliament, is that they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry to Parliament may mean space television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals "."
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "we must engage in dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted vis - Ã  - vis of the Russia, goes into crisis, and we are not reforming, we risk becoming a protectorate of the Russia.
However we want to be independent "."
The opposition fears that the Organization for security and cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process recognizes the validity of the ballot.
She pointed out that participation figures appear too high, and that generalization of polls (26% of the voters in Minsk) opened the vote to manipulation.
"You noticed that there's an election, you?" queries the social - democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was nobody in the polling stations.
And there are those who best suit the power to maximum of five members of the opposition in the Parliament, "."
The silence of the night falls on October Square.
On television, president Loukachenko and members of the central election commission welcomed their success.
The interview - the blood once again secure.
HÃ©ma - QuÃ©bec yesterday celebrated the 10th anniversary of its Foundation, and its President, Dr. Francine DÃ©cary, had reason to rejoice, because HÃ©ma - QuÃ©bec has become one of the suppliers of blood safer and more efficient world.
And above all, he regained the confidence of the public that had been seriously shaken by the scandal of blood contaminated in the 1980s and 1990s.
As known, the country of blood supply managed by the cross transfusion Service - Canadian Red had been contaminated by the virus of acquired immunodeficiency (HIV) and the virus of hepatitis C in the 1980s.
Before this drama and the grumbling of the public, the Government of the Canada established in February 1994 a public inquiry, chaired by Justice Horace Krever, survey designed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to ensure that such a disaster does not happen again.
While Justice Krever was slow to file his report, some provinces have set up a Committee aimed at planning a new system of management of the blood in the Canada.
In Quebec, the Gardiner Committee has fulfilled this mandate.
Following reports Krever and GÃ©lineau, two suppliers were created in the Canada: HÃ©ma - QuÃ©bec to serve Quebec and Canadian society of blood to supply all other provinces and two territories.
"In 1998, when HÃ©ma - QuÃ©bec began operations, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the system of blood in Quebec, recalls Dr. DÃ©cary.
The situation was daunting.
Our efforts to improve the safety of blood products and the fieldwork during the years that followed, we regained the confidence of the public ", said - before assert proudly that in early 2008, almost 94% of the Quebec population she now trusted by HÃ©ma - QuÃ©bec.
Dr. DÃ©cary however keep in mind that "confidence is something extremely fragile".
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, HÃ©ma - QuÃ©bec has applied the precautionary principle.
At this time, we attended the outbreak of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease, new variant Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease in Europe, says that holding the fort since its foundation in 1998.
"And we knew not at all if the disease could be transmitted by blood.
It then relied on one of the main recommendations of the reports Krever and GÃ©lineau, that when it is not and that a serious illness can result, in this case of Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease characterized by degeneration of the brain leading inevitably to death, it introduces measures of exclusion.
In April 1999, were therefore denied the blood of people who had stayed over a month in the Kingdom - Uni since 1980.
However, a few years ago, it has been shown beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle be applied sense "."
In 1999 appeared on the market a lot more sensitive technique of HIV testing: nucleic acid (TAN) tests that detect directly in the blood of donors for the virus him - same and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which were based the tests used until then.
The TAN helped to shorten the window period, which extends between the time where the person has been infected and where the first virus can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
Could reduce this period to less than a week.
Was thus decreased substantially the risk that some donors are infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements helped to significantly lower the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, a 12 million person runs the risk of receiving blood contaminated with HIV.
"In other words, it means that it will take distribute 12 million blood products until someone is infected with HIV.
As HÃ©ma - QuÃ©bec distributes each year between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products, it will take more than 24 years before occurrence of a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product.
I think that we can now feel comfortable to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to regain health ", says the CEO of HÃ©ma - QuÃ©bec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than the year past is appeared on the island of Reunion Chikungunya virus which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
It must be constantly vigilant ", continues Dr. DÃ©cary before highlighting that in addition to a secure supply, HÃ©ma - QuÃ©bec must also provide an adequate supply.
"Needs increase because the population is aging.
Being more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need charging red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the blood donor network that has an average of only 3% of eligible Canadians to donate blood "."
Any person healthy, aged 18 years and more meets the eligibility criteria can, however, give blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people offering their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where there is malaria, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With this 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of the hospitals.
The shortages are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this network of donors as they get older and can no longer give their blood.
It is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but especially to detain and to encourage them to become a regular donor.
Life today is so frantic, rarely found time to spend an hour to give his blood ", is sorry Francine DÃ©cary.
With an annual budget of $ 297 million, HÃ©ma - QuÃ©bec provides blood products, but also human tissues, including bone, heart valves grafts, eyeballs and skin which is almost exclusively used for major burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before be stored at Hema - Quebec, which also manages the only public Bank of cord blood in Quebec.
The umbilical cord which was once regarded as a biomedical waste is packed with a rich blood stem cells that can be used to treat serious illnesses, such as leukemia.
"It celebrated a few weeks ago, implementing our thousandth sample of cord blood bank and is expected to take more than one thousand per year.
It should begin to propose for transplants early next year ", says Dr. DÃ©cary describing this as very popular cord blood sampling program.
"Several moms are disappointed not being able to access" â HÃ©ma - QuÃ©bec does not have the means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.

The "Northern Plan" is the fourth pan of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labor - with France, an agreement between the Canada and Europe and the agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the speech of the Prime Minister recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - never had the object a presentation.
The Prime Minister however merely to explain why the North was "a jewel in the immense potential", but gave no deadline, amounts of investment, nor priority specify in upcoming projects.
At most a few avenues which could be developed further: including hydropower, forest, but especially the mining sector, boosted by growth in emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, Platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond", according to Mr. Charest enumeration.
This 'territory twice as big as the France', "it is here, it is in Quebec.
Not only it is with us, but it is in us ", he insisted, as to show that he was seeking a national myth.
Quebec is much built in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the Klondike gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, the James Bay.
"It is up to us, it is our future," he added, after a pause theatrical to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of the territory of Quebec, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said at the press briefing.
"It is a traditional position that all Governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there is no agreement for very long and, when the opportunity arises, I reiterate this position - there on behalf of the Government ", he said.
Moreover, "with climate change, we need to rethink our Northern vision", he said referring to the passage of North - West, which opens all year round due to the melting ice.
In this new geopolitical environment, the Prime Minister considers that occupy the territory is a duty.
And the inhabitants of the territory, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive towards them and that project would benefit to them, especially to young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel LÃ©tourneau (former Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois member of Ungava), have already started consultations with some 30 communities.
An interdepartmental Committee chaired by BenoÃ®t Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and natural resources) has an important place has started work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, "not necessarily a Summit", but a time where "we will give a common vision".
Development in the North would be in conformity with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be "concerted, ordered and respectful of the environment", he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'vision' as being in continuity with the first Liberal Minister who preceded him.
"As the Liberals who us preceded, we thought otherwise for turning challenges into new opportunities for growth and development".
This has also been one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which was started Friday by a great cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rebrand the Beauharnois plant in dam AdÃ©lard - Godbout.
"Godbout, who created Hydro - QuÃ©bec, Lesage that made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, Bourassa who made the James Bay, our party was able to forge the future", said Jean Charest.
In press briefing, he relied on another reference, conservative-there, the program "Roads to the North" of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Turning - Eastmain1a electric - dam hydro project Ruper, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning was planned for 2012.
"It's still between us there, but I plan to be", he told his supporters, raising at home of applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rejected the possibility of triggering a vote this fall, what the law allows.
He pointed out that his schedule is however filled by a mission of the Council of the federation in China and a QuÃ©bec - New York Summit.
The general Council of the weekend has provided liberal leader a nationalist resolutions containing platform, such "constitutional aspirations" that are passed as a letter in the mail: the PLQ seeks in particular the "specificity of Quebec" recognition in the Constitution.
He also wishes that Quebec should appoint members of the Council of broadcasting and telecommunications and that the latter have a right of veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, it welcomed the broad outlines of the Plan Nord with skepticism.
The Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois leader, Pauline Marois, showed northern development policy - of - Quebec Government Landry was launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, gave to apply it.
If it did, "it would be more advanced today" commented Ms. Marois alongside its candidate in Jean - Talon (ballot taking place today), FranÃ§oise mercury.
The ADQ expressed support for the adoption of a Plan Nord by the Government.
"But what we want is that it is not just a show," said SÃ©bastien Proulx leader, to replace Mario Dumont, who returns from holiday today.
Letters - A disgraced country.
It is Mr. Vic Toews, ex - Minister of 'Justice' (Oh irony) in the Harper cabinet, which were allowed last summer to say of Louise Arbour as a "shame" for the Canada.
So shame on this woman who has led a relentless struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration speaks also on the entourage of Prime Minister Stephen Harper on him - even.
Here we are before a Government which is the only one among all Western countries involved, to not repatriated its nationals imprisoned in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A Government that does not take into account that Omar Khadr was a teenager at the time of the facts attributed to him.
The only Government which, despite the fact that the Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, reneged on his word and let languish in inhuman conditions a child - soldier.
The only one who relies on a travesty of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
For the record, remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International, and the Canadian Bar Association, including, argue for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that it enjoys a fair trial in the Canada.
This is the same Government that condoned torture: regardless of him that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably for ever after so many years of abuse.
It does realizes yet, but we are now seeing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper continues to brandish and that sounds so hollow in her mouth.
Here comes the time where no morality no longer exists: can bully, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the whim of a head of Government minority so far (only in it will be after October 14,...).
Number of voters believe that they will find salvation in a party which advocates virtue, law and order: they do not see that this Government has abandoned what was the reputation and dignity of our country.
Shame, Mr. Toews, it is there, in this cessation and not elsewhere.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold Orwellian speech.
In its edition of September 17, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice - Chairman of the Canadian mining Barrick Gold.
Continuing Orwellian logic, that - above says that the largest gold company in the world has instituted an action in defamation of six million against three authors and a small publishing house penniless to launch a 'transparent public debate'.
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, this is not the truth they feel, especially in the case of defamation, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely overshadowed by M. Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be - it to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and the Publisher of the book Black Canada will spend considerable sums of money to prepare their defence and combat very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by pockets almost bottomless of the mining.
The tactics in unequal struggles is often ruining the defendants in order to impose a settlement settlement agreement which bÃ¢illonnera the opposition in addition to scare off anyone who dares to focus again on the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is before public opinion ought to present his vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in many of the countries where works Barrick Gold, the debates in the Canada are normally through the exchange of ideas and not with batons.
It was thus sufficient for the mining to open its books, records and establish a true debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent research teams who could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust the public and rejects from the back of the hand the petitions and letters of support to the authors of black Canada.
May - be Mr. Garver could - it explain how it can both call a 'public' debate while scorning the opinions of this same audience?
In the world of vice - president, it seems that this word means only highly paid lawyers and all Canadians; This is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even the critics are entitled to the floor.
This does not - or does not understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public supporting authors and publishers of black Canada does it before all because he rejects the brutal way of mining.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of exchanges civilized arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a pursuit - gag (continuing the 'public debate', Barrick Gold comes also to file a formal notice at the place of the authors of black Canada directing them to cease the use of this term...).
To the - beyond the speech surreal M. Garver, the continuation of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
She denies, bulk, the right to quote from credible sources and the debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the base even intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under penalty of prosecution repeatedly, which can do?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of black Canada.
She has a right of reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, knows long handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The excessive pursuit of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims, has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the World University as well as for public debate in the Canada, and it is time that Governments implement devices limiting the kind of malicious prosecution.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans agree.
The Bush administration and the leaders leader of Congress, both Republican and Democrat, have finally come to an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US $ 700 billion plan aimed at curbing the financial crisis that shakes Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both houses of Congress.
It includes: control by elected representatives of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of homes seized for non-payment, as well as a right to look at the salaries paid to the executives of rescued firms.
The American Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, the Chairman of the House of representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative at the table of negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a marathon of negotiations by two days.
"We made great progress toward an agreement that will be effective on the markets," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"Everything was done to shelter the real economy and ordinary Americans of the current crisis on Wall Street," said the Democrat.
"This is the important point: If we do not do this, the trauma, the chaos and disturbances on the daily lives of Americans will be enormous", said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned in the sprint in the last hours for fear of the effect that could cause a new failure on the mood of investors.
The time limit that it was granted was the opening up of markets this morning.
Related late in the negotiations, the two candidates for the U.S. presidential election were rather in favour of the agreement, without however fail to express their displeasure be obliged to come to this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has assigned the addition of certain provisions in the agreement, including to allow homeowners to keep their homes and that payday leaders companies rescued by the State.
"When we ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no what welcomed.
But these measures are necessary ", he commented on the waves of American television.
When asked about another string to see if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, responded: "I would like to see the details, but I hope that Yes".
"The outlines that I have read [show] that it is something that we will all have to digest and with which we will be able to proceed.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable ", he said.
700 billion plan aims to redeem debts, assets at risk and unmarketable financial institutions American with taxpayers ' money.
It happens after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of mortgage lending to sub-prime before spreading to other more widespread credit titles (CAAP) and lead to a freezing of liquidity and the rout of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of elected Republican officials who had scuppered the first draft agreement, last week.
Is believed to be out of this deadlock since the Democrats have accepted that certain "toxic" assets of the companies in trouble are only insured by the Government, rather than purchased.
To round the corners for everyone in Congress, also added a provision that if the Government were to assume losses for five years with this program, it could implement new taxes to help him retrieve his release.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first instalment of 250 billion which will be able to add 100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
Payment of 350 billion should be endorsed by another vote of the Congress.
In Exchange for his help, Washington will obtain holdings in rescued companies that earned him dividends in the event of profit and that he can resell when the turmoil will be passed.
The federal Government will have the option to delay the procedures of seizures relating to housing attached to the loans concerned by the plan, as well as limits to compensation and severance paid to executives of the affected companies.
The architects of the plan would see it submitted to the vote of the House of representatives today, from and to the Senate Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Voices have indeed continued to rise yesterday against this project, both in the Republican than Democrat.
"Obviously, Washington cannot hear you", told his constituents address the Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one which is to take advantage of taxpayers '. "
Host a small group Congressman nicknamed "skeptics caucus", the democratic representative Brad Sherman presents differently, but came to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred prominent economics professors, including three Nobel, we have written to tell us: asked Congress not to hurry and to carefully examine the way to take", he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, was once again the evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries have announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the Governments of the Belgium, the Netherlands and the Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas advised her renunciation to acquire its competitor in the sinking since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US) in the crisis of real estate States at-risk loans - United.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"It is not lost money, said yesterday the Dutch Minister of finance Wouter Bos.
In Exchange, we get a right to vote in the Bank and the influence.
It is precisely something that investors and households appreciate now that times are uncertain "."
Meanwhile, across the channel, the British Government seemed on track to nationalise another bank beset by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, Government would resume its account all current loans at the Bank Bradford and Bringley, which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion US) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander yesterday indicated that it was she who would buy the branches and accounts receivable of the British Bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second Bank, after Northern Rock, the British Government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - death of a committed icon.
Its beauty in the eyes of French Riviera long was his trump card, and some will say its weakness.
Was - it released the narcissistic mirror, American actor in the charming smile?
Yes and no.
Modesty, sensitivity and a talent that flowed from source it will be also remote register power that brings forth the true sacred monsters.
But what great runner!
Paul Newman, disappeared Friday, aged 83, from lung cancer complications in his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the boom years.
Less monumental than Brando, that it looked like and where he long was a sort of rival to the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but Apostle also of freedom and the burst of dramatic conventions.
The mixed bloods are often beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots was born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without ego disproportionate, ultimate quality mark.
Because in him is projected a whole country loving the self made man, the fighter of the Pacific war, wounded in battle, which at the beginning of the 1950s studied drama at Yale and attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumph in the theatre, on television, soon at the cinema.
This same man who campaigned for civil rights was also the racing driver who came second at the 24 hours of le Mans in 1979, doubled a sex symbol, albeit for a couple model formed since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappear with him the shadow areas of this star secret, discrete, engaged, allergic to bursts of show - business, which it will not quite pierced the Enigma.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
The disappearance of Paul Newman gave the giddy moviegoers this weekend, while rattling its major roles on the black screen of memories.
More than a half - century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation will scroll through it.
Return to jockeying in memory the cow - boy charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting its sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in CAT on a Hot Tin Roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), it evokes its sensitive Mr Bridge, disorder in his old age by a marriage that did not all its promises.
So many other Paul Newman are passed to the history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me, Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, included (marked by hatred) after his death, which really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic gangster in The brilliant, Sting (the sting), Oscar for best film in 1973.
Bitter and vengeful billiards in the magnificent Player The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961), he will resume the character on the return in The Color of Money from Martin Scorsese, who won in 1987 his only Oscar on nine nominations.
This face through the ages, it was him.
Him again.
Eras jostle through his journey.
Young people know him primarily through the cult Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, an unorthodox ice hockey team coach.
His fans it were found in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy, the Coen brothers.
With a last role of Irish mobster in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes in 2003, the loop was buckled.
Against several legends of cinema which lÃ¢chÃ¨rent early craft, Newman will be remained long in the saddle, while denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its splendor and its concessions.
The french filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered, not without humour, "as a living challenge to" the underplaying "judging too supported performances.
The profession has not always been tender for handsome Paul Newman who roles fell long all cooked in the beak.
However he played less often the young first as marginals: neuroses, alcoholic, bastards, or desperate, whose perfect features reflected derivatives and revolts.
As a Director, Newman revealed facets poorly known its true sensitivity modes.
Her Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (from the novel by the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, work of shame and sadness.
Among the rain of tributes that unfurled yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former companion in arms Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) stated, very saddened: "his presence has made my life and this country better".
Generosity, love of existence are vibrating traits of the missing actor.
By - beyond his legend career, also clears a great campaigner for civil rights, environmentalism, independent cinema, a challenger to the excesses of Hollywood.
Will be seen much his hoe enthroned on pots of dressing, sauces, biscuits and other food, judging the process pretty bad taste, although gag at the beginning.
These sales were nevertheless proceeds to his foundation for children in difficulty.
Newman, rather than sit on his myth, will be committed until the end.
He left five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "always and until the end, your father has been incredibly grateful for his good fortune.
It was a privilege to be there '. "
And a privilege for us to have followed the journey of an American artist so lucid and so generous.
Model citizen, in sum, sus.
That could well make Zuschlag & company at their factory in invoices?
Soon, on 8 October, will begin hearings pertaining to the ongoing criminal proceedings against Janos Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of scam, in the form of criminal organization, permanent and regular manner, involving particularly serious damage. Of other counts were retained against them, for example, forgery and use of forgeries.
According prosecutors, grants, money was spent for personal purposes, while benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money of the State and the municipalities, approximately 65 million HUF in total, would on the one hand into the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other hand, in the pocket of some people.
Their method, made public by the authorities responsible for the investigation, was touching the subsidies obtained money by issuing invoices for costs, behind which no real benefit was provided and thus, associations did never meet their commitments.
According to the indictment, a large part of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they obtained books of invoices to the JÃ³zsefvÃ¡ros market, while they made the stamps to Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that would appear on the invoices, it was decided, inter alia, during tours in the province in the North of Lake Balaton, performed by IstvÃ¡n Lados, at the request of Janos Zuschlag.
And after the deposition of the latter, it should identify pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, requesting an invoice, on the model which they realized the other invoices that they would introduce, among others, the Ministry of youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and labour, as well as the municipality of the capital to access grants.
The majority of the invoices was created by IstvÃ¡n Lados and his accomplice AndrÃ¡s Åri, who according to our information, was above all to prepare records necessary for obtaining the grants.
During a "tracking circuit", one of the choices of Lados was a bistro.
According the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place has ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos bridge EgyesÃ¼let.
However, according to the Manager, it would have been impossible as many people occupy this place, at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, established invoice on behalf of the Foundation Jobb JovÅert, which subsequently will be called egyÃ¼tt a Harmadik Evezredert, swarmed forms and substantive mistakes.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, had really only three rooms, and ten maximum people could spend the night. However, the invoice mentioned one hundred and thirty customers.
Billers in the imagination have also fallen into excess, when they mentioned the Pigal Kft company, also owned the hotel and catering sector. In their accounts, neither the name of Jobb JovÅert, nor the Hoppa did appear, according to the information given to the public prosecutor.
GyÅzÅ Farkas, the Manager of the company, said site hvg.hu that when prosecutors summoned him and showed him the Bills, he knew, right away, that it was false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the stamp".
He added: "beyond the form, the fact that, according to the Bill, 100 people were housed there, stuck either, since hotel has eleven rooms, which do not have as much room.
Moreover, the invoice also mentioned meals, and our restaurant is closed since a long time "."
The zealous billers are not shown on travel agencies of Budapest, part of their choice but organizing that trips abroad. Thus, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on bills to settle in cash, which is also contrary to the accounting practices of the Agency.
Of Moreover, as it appeared during the investigation, they added also the VAT on these documents, while the services concerning the activities of trips, with a destination outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices issued on behalf of the Hotel RÃ©vfÃ¼lÃ¶p Jobb JovÅert agenda was incorrect, since the benefits of the company do not support a VAT of 25% as shown, but a 15% VAT. In addition, the employees of the hotel emit only invoices printed, while that fake were written by hand.
The investigation reveals that "issuers" have also made mistakes in stating that the delivery transport of goods by road, that the issuer of the bills could not exercise, saw that his profile was the investment advice.
In addition, it is also for defects of forms, such as types of improper invoices and false stamps, that invoices issued to the order of egyÃ¼tt a Harmadik Evezredert AlapÃ­tvÃ¡ny, XXI. Szazadi KulturÃ¡lis EgyesÃ¼let and Biztos bridge proved false.
Just like in the case of society Ravenna BT. or KunfehÃ©rtÃ³ sports internship, which both deny being the authors of the invoices issued in their name.
Counterfeiters have not paid attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., established in NyÃ­regyhÃ¡za, was liquidated at the time (2001) Fiatal Varosert EgyesÃ¼let group was supposed to have a meal at home. According our information, it is for this reason that the liquidator of the company denies issuing this invoice.
Invoices made deliberately.
Another category of billers is composed of those who were aware that he was asked to give fictitious invoices.
Foundation EsÃ©ly Budapestert AlapÃ­tvÃ¡ny, at the request of the grouping of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifju Szocialistak, has prepared a bill on the agenda of the Foundation egyÃ¼tt a Harmadik Evezredert, for a sum of four million HUF.
According the indictment, the Manager of the company Al Kft. was brought to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic GyÃ¶rfi.
Similarly, cooperated with the Zuschlags, Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation and that in 2003, issued invoices to order of the Jobb JovÅert AlapÃ­tvÃ¡ny, Atlasz EgyesÃ¼let association Foundation and the association VorosfenyÅ EgyesÃ¼let, amounting to approximately five million HUF, but behind which no performance was actually provided.
No financial movement took place, either, given that the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but this, organizations have well avoided to mention in their accounts.
The next category of issuers of bills is directly linked to the accused corporations.
Thus, the administrative delegate of the Director general of the company Delta Trio Kft., dealing with trade in fuel and motor vehicles, whose headquarters was in Budapest, but where it was found, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued multiple invoices relating to the sale of computer equipment, amounting to approximately 18 million HUF.
According to the survey, these facilities would have purchased by the company Cash Investment Kft. kiskunhalas, which was in liquidation since September 14, 2005.
The Director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Ivan Kubatov have also sent documents in connection with the company between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that it issued invoices on the agenda of companies Atlasz, Hoppa and egyÃ¼tt a Harmadik Evezredert AlapÃ­tvÃ¡ny, and that he pocketed against them - value.
It is precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian Masons have created corporations Fa - Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos - Investment Bt.
In reality, none of these companies were working, that the accused due to the fact that they weren't working.
He used when even these companies, since at the request of master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as editor of the Foundation of the companies acts, he established their names, to the order of associations related to Zuschlag, such as associations Atlasz invoices and Y - Generacio.
Kubatov gave to organizations, 15 bills in total, issued by the companies Cash Investment, Delta Fa - Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Trio, for a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The Prosecutor believed that 10% of the amounts shown on the invoices as well as VAT went into the pocket of Kubatov.
Man has even used the company Szi - Beri BT. to establish fictitious invoices that were used in the grant of Biztos bridge application.
In January 2006, the Association Y - Generacio and SzÃ¶vetsÃ©g has Modern Magyarorszagert have introduced a grant application with the authority of public usefulness of the Socialist Party, TÃ¡ncsics MihÃ¡ly AlapÃ­tvÃ¡ny (TMA).
They got this grant for an amount of HUF 500,000 twice, but these amounts have not been used for the purposes specified in the application.
To avoid that people are aware, five fictitious invoices received from the company Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, are these invoices that have been found in the search conducted in the office of Arpad Kemecsei, at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the accused tell the method of manufacture of the invoices, as it had already done to the public prosecutor.
What would be really interesting would be that the main accused, Janos Zuschlag him - even, decides to lift the veil on history.
So far, his confession are not very detailed, and although he has promised repeatedly to tell every detail, it has not yet done.
The question is whether it is in its interest, or then, eventually, Socialists have concluded an agreement whereby in Exchange for repayment of a large part of fifty millions of HUF, Zusi would be only the hat.
Today he is probably upset, since requests for its placement under house arrest, on basis of a relief of his conditions of detention, continually fall into a deaf ear.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and non-repairable economic offenders, roam freely or at least expect their own homes the end of the procedure. It does not have this possibility.
The psychology of one-upmanship: why we spend more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and to overestimate the goods.
Researchers in neurology and in economics from New York University succeeded in updating the neurological and economic of this behaviour known and apparently irrational bases.
And after their study published in the journal Science, human beings humans do not want to be left behind in this type of competition, as for example an auction on eBay, and that is why they prefer even pay too high a price.
The research attempted to develop a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" using sales in experimental auctions.
One of the groups of volunteers played the lottery, while the other group took part in a playful auctions, while using functional MRI (fMRI), researchers analyzed the active brain areas of experimental subjects.
In two games, participants could win money, but during the sale auctions of which an essential element is the higher bid from a third party, all located in the brainstem, called striatum, involved in intensive way movement during the loss of the part.
This part of the brain, next to several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism d ' "auto - stimulation" of the nervous system.
That is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained with the leak before the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists of this group of researchers members continued analyses of financial supervision.
At celles - ci, three groups surenchÃ©rissaient with a partner, in various circumstances.
They simply informed the group control of the actual value of the product in question, and them have thus made their implementation.
At another group, they promised that if, in addition, they came out winner of the part, then they would receive $ 15 additional as a reward.
While the third group has received these 15 dollars prior to the auction, but the members of the Group also lost money in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is that emphasis was placed one on the victory, while in the other for the failure.
Thus proving the hypothesis of neurologists, members of the team players 'against failure"were willing to bets higher than those made by the control group and the group"for the victory".
"These results may be demonstrated by any already existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena observed at auctions by the pleasure of winning and the parade before the risk.
Only the neuro-imaging methods have helped remove the contradiction between the two theories, now, resulting in a third explanation "." -a found Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Faculty of economic sciences of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should - consult us a doctor?
Worldwide, about half a billion people suffer from hepatitis B or chronic C, while in Hungary, the chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death.
An estimated one hundred miles the patients of virus hepatitis in Hungary, but only seven miles following treatment. This is from the fact that often patients do not know they are carrying the virus.
The name of the hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but pathogens and caused diseases differ from each other.
The virus of hepatitis, according to the pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example: contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travelers, it is anyway recommended to be vaccinated against influenza A and B. There is no vaccine against the C...
The symptoms of hepatitis has appear two to three weeks after consumption of food contaminated, in general, accompanied by a poor general condition, weakness, stomach aches and nausea.
Then develops on the skin and the white of the eye visible jaundice, the stools become clearer and the urine takes on a darker color. Healing may take two to three weeks.
Around the world, each year, one million people die from the most severe form of this disorder, such as cancer or cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B...
The main cause is that according to estimates, only a patient in ten receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most of the sick is not virus, destroys pathogenic gene's sneaky way because the liver cells. In many cases, symptoms do not appear until 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular testing.
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who have had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and them tattooed.
Currently, it amounts to 200 million patients with chronic hepatitis of type C worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult his doctor from observing symptoms of unknown origin.
The disease can be cured, if detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of contagion disappears and the development of a cancer is prevented.
September 30 is the world hepatitis day organised for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing patients from the four corners of the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis, caused by virus, on the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
That which grows in God feels - it less pain?
According the results of a recent research, religious belief would function as a kind of analgesic, which have already helped make more bearable the death of Catholic martyrs.
The British Daily Telegraph published an article that Oxford University researchers conducted an interesting experiment by analyzing what level belief in God could influence the pain tolerance of the human being.
As part of this experiment strange, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subject to electroshocks, while each of them was a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, the Catholic believers were able to exclude a large portion of suffering.
Using a technique of palpation of the human brain, could also discover that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
This analysis is the first in a series of experiments, in which academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians are from different sectors of the University.
Specifically, the experience takes place in the following way: an instrument emitting sparks and disseminating electroconvulsive therapy is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked participants the experience watching sustained two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with the ermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
Researchers at the origin of this experience had hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary evokes a sort of State of faith among believers, while the choice of the Da Vinci painting, not very different from the first, focused on its soothing effect.
Experimental subjects have passed a half - time in an MRI scanner, and during this time, received 20 electroshock four partly succeeding, looking at the religious theme painting either that more general theme.
Catholics have stated that the view of the Virgin Mary, they felt as "safely", as someone whose "take care" and they "calmed, and peace invaded".
In view of the religious theme painting, they reported on 12% of pain less when they watched the work of Leonard.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who him - even took part in the experiment, believe that we can achieve the same effect with any other strong image among atheists, provided you find the appropriate photo.
'' We should find a picture to which they react very positively, as for example a mother or a father, '' said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, anglican Bishop, welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of the faith should change and in many cases, actually changes our personality," said Wright.
These excellent results, it only remains the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if it is shown to believers a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same caliber?
What is the sight of a Virgin Mary of better quality would cause better results?
You are what you disclosed to your subject.
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google says that it can be found at the bottom of the pocket of people in the same way as the sky over their heads. He knows where they spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what are their areas of interest.
It is yet not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential persons of the company.
While in regards to skeptics making a parallel with the vision of horror of Orwell, those - ci don't see precisely the essence of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt said, there is little in the Financial Times that the main goal of Google is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary so that the founders of Google can maintain their initial objective that sounded as follows: "Collect in a system all the information of the world!".
According the queried Google leader, after ten years of work by world upheavals, they are still only at the beginning of their goals to be able to treat all information.
The question: what is there in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like that Google can answer questions like "could - I do tomorrow?" or "What is the work that me would be best?". However, software can answer this kind of question, simple at first glance, the day where they will learn enough about the users.
It is not perfectly clear to all users that the words used during research on the internet, the IP address of the computer that initiates the search and the pages then consulted by interested persons are specifically listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can see what they sought, whereupon they clicked. Thanks to this, long term, recommendations, based on the same logic program, will be able to give much more personalised answers and we submit products and services based on our previous declarations and our registered preferences.
Qu ' it happens if someone uses my data against me, if he looks at what is my job? ask users who are concerned about seeing the Google information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by the company that can generate fear, and this is pas remorse, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the revolt against the power that can give rise to among Internet users a counter - reaction.
It is however confirmed that the search terms are not only registered, but in justified cases, they are transferred to another party, and in this kind of legal case, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most resounding example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against paedophiles Brazilians, during which Google has forwarded to the Brazilian Government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, allowing identification.
Human rights-conscious users were able to breathe a sigh of relief last may, when Google, arm top underneath with the body of electronic legal protection EFF, proved his right to the Court against the FBI. From the judgment, in the future, Google cannot always be required by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information on the secret request for the FBI, of any nature whatsoever.
(At the same time, the federal Government has successfully obtained some 50,000 addresses web and 1,000 search terms that he had won over the strengthening of the law on the protection of the child, voted several years previously.) But ultimately, he fails to get the lists of research by private users, or the entire list websites and key words in these last two months.).
The judgment of Google is therefore quite contradictory: it is blasted by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and their private domain suffer when they start to use Google services. Therefore, they are tackling them in the spirit of revolt that is manifested against proud multinational corporations of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and its "savages" bringing together enthusiasts, activists and the enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of big business, the 'connected corporation', as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as invader of the world because of Windows, and although both are fighting for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users of identification code, does not require any money for its applications. The documentary code and package programs, continuously refreshed, has an effect much more accessible, youngest and coolest, facing the practice of official software giant.
The reason can also be that geeks are very exactly the relationship problem between human rights and the internet, and what web 2.0, the key word most proclaimed these last years, shoot just behind him.
Indeed, web 2.0 is not another thing that collaboration, than the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use communication channels at our disposal, and while the dimension of those - ci changes one by one, essentially remains the same: it exposes.
A young, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, Facebook to Xanga, and it can even connect those - in other benefits, such as for example to Twinter, or to last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can connect those - in a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also keep blogs, in which automatically appear their most recent photo galleries they store on Flickr or Picasa.
While one can take knowledge of many examples, such as the girlfriend who includes easily to view pictures of the morning, taken by the circle of mutual friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening, or society who dismissed one of its employees, nothing only to heartfelt opinions-ci wrote on his blog about the top management, can be on one thing: the end of private life is totally to reconsider these days.
One who lives a life online, is that it shows him - even, and so can be defined the principle behind the behavior of today's youth.
That wants to hide something, or at least wants to try to get around the monopoly of Google, can do (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but, at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so it is not possible to find them, is not the least. Google services online, through text processing in image processing, to reading information may be replaced by alternative versions, which are not attached to huge parks of servers and who assemble not our best profile, having existed so far.
Public opinion expects without really hide, the moment where Google will unveil its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $ 156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca - Cola ($110 billion). Advertising areas AdWords / AdSense threaten sales of advertising agencies, while the benefits introduced at a speed more important cause serious migraines not only to Microsoft, but to many other designers of computer programs.
However, critical observers found, beside it, contradictions having disturbing effects: for example, the top management of the company has refused, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after that it has doubled the price of the company kindergarten and after society has deemed too costly multiple catering daily, taken anytime. All this pales beside that in 2006, Google has acquiesced to the Chinese Government and according to the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that hurt good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According one of the internal rules of the company, the new services are not advertised only when they can be used. What is on, it is that in the coming months and coming years, they will move the world on new points. While some believe that the draft scan and archive of books and magazines from Google takes so important dimensions that the company will soon find themselves faced with the Supreme Court of the States - United, others tremble before its Health system, because in that -, one can construct a full medical benefit from our previous analyses resultsour physicians and our problems.
The fact that Google mounts a genetic database can give a good topic first to the next generation of authors of science - fiction. The famous Cory Doctorow novel with half - tones Orwellian, describes the future in which a man could be approached so bewilderingly nothing through Google's data.
Two minors have helped to eliminate the traces of the double homicide of Ãzd.
"The police summoned two minors for questioning in the case of the double homicide of Ãzd. "From suspects, they have helped to eliminate the traces of the crime". -said the door - speech of Commissioner Department of Borsod.
The youth acknowledged the facts which they are accused. For now, they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according the information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency) are girls, defend themselves free.
The complicity of murder may cause a remand of up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double homicide of Ãzd, a young man of the old corner 23-year-old has been placed in pre-trial detention, Sunday.
The counts against him are homicide, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it is revealed that the 23-year-old male had a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not pay its debt, and it is for this reason that he attracted his creditor, last Wednesday, in a site of Ãzd where he killed him, as well as the granddaughter of the man, aged 9.
According the information from the MTI, the young man planned his crime. The proof is the weapon with which he would commit his crimes hidden on the scene of the crime.
The police examined the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made a proposal for the acquisition of the Prague stock exchange.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has proposed two hundred million euros, about 5 billion Czech Crowns, for the acquisition of 100% of the package of shares of the Prague stock exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the poles were made despite the fact that previously, the Czechs have excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange of the circle of new potential owners of the Prague stock exchange.
The cause of this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange lies in the hands of the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State wishing to secede from more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to Czech daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest bid that has been made so far for the redemption of the Prague stock exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic stock exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Borse made an offer so far.
Petr Koblic, Director of the Prague stock exchange, said last week that among the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the least good owner, and has not ruled out the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague stock exchange in the future.
The Prague stock exchange is valued between 5 and 10 billion CZK by specialists in the market.
Based on an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is the Investment Bank Patria Finance, with about 25 per cent of investments, followed by 14.7 per cent of the Bank Ceska Sporitelna and Tiger Holding oven S. a.r.l with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press.
In their comments of the devoted to the international financial crisis Tuesday, worsening day by day, the leaders of the European press newspapers already evoke a "second September 11".
"The global financial disaster, it owes to the U.S. president"-accused Rome newspaper La Repubblica. "President has even not been able to block with his own party behind a law proposal, improvised to va - fast, aimed to rescue a desperate situation"...
Instead a new Pearl Harbour, as evoked it the billionaire Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to speak of a second 9/11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
After the vision of the newspaper El Mundo, are the failures of political leadership â down which led the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system to increases every day, and subsequently, the whole world will pay the price high.
The Bush plan was far from perfect, however according to the vote of the Congress, a real threat, that Washington does not tool policy to deal with the crisis.
The world economy depends in a vacuum, just at the time in the history of capitalism, one of the largest transformations.
We cannot ignore the threat more long - underlines the Tages - Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some States can still extend a lifeline to their whispered financial organizations, and thanks to their taxpayers ' money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more than banks collapsed like dominoes, then nor financial means, nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
Long term, we need that the States of the European Union are few cases of national selfishness, and they centralize the control above the divided financial markets.
Nothing that Monday, weakened financial institutions received more than EUR 100 billion - recalled the Viennese daily, Der Standard, adding to fears that taxpayers will also have to put his hand to the Pocket, very deep, similarly to the Americans to deal with the crisis, become increasingly realistic.
So far, EU does not really dealt with the crisis, which, as a tsunami passes through, part in hand, the old continent.
"Rescuers" must not brandish one hundred billion euros immediately, however it would be wise if they noted in which case it would be rational to touch money from taxpayers, with the objective to prevent bigger damage.
Intelligent automotive mimics the flight of the Bumblebee.
What method would be best to develop technologies suitable to avoid an obstacle, if this is the imitation of a detector of obstacles existing in nature?
For example, that of bees.
In the amazing project, presented at CEATEC, taking place at the Japan, buzzing bees gave the strategic idea engineers at Nissan, to inspire them on how they should design the next generation of detectors of obstacles.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini car robot, a robotic system to control auto - bio - inspired, type BR23C, it equipped with the qualities of bees, the final objective being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During his flights, each bee constitutes its own space, oval, which actually looks a lot like our secure protective shell - explained at the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the Director of the Department research and development and technology public relations of the mark.
The eye to facets of the bee plays a key role, since it is able to see in all directions, in a 300-degree angle.
To mimic the functions of the eye faceted, engineers have discussed the idea of the laser rangefinder.
-Ci identifies barriers in an angle of 180 degrees and a distance of 2 metres before the BR23C, it evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the microprocessor to edge, which transforms it into evasive action immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini car robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels turning of a sufficient angle to avoid collision.
Unlike any existing system currently, this avoidance manoeuvre takes place entirely instinctive way.
"If it were not so, the mini auto robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the Director of the mobility laboratory and project car robotic.
It must respond instinctive and instantaneous, since this technology is the most vulnerable layer and the innermost envelope protection, a layer where at the moment the collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process should reflect that the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in a blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference may not go up, down or diagonally, it can be of two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheel can rotate.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that have the bees to avoid other bees, in our case, could not use the rotary motion, the acceleration and the slowdown as labourers at the disposal of the mini auto robot.
The BR23C uses Lithium polymer batteries which are lighter and concentrate of energy is more big, which makes their life expectancy longer than in version Lithium - ion.
According Andoh, it is the smart instinctive reaction which is paramount, not the processing of the data, and even less the ability to store.
This mechanism must process that some incoming signals per second, and react to those - ci.
It is not necessary to store them and react with the intuitive logic based on the data of the previous manoeuvres. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilo - bytes of memory continuously.
There is no need of memory with a capacity of giga - bytes, or even mega - bytes.
It is the first step towards the design of a technology for avoidance instant. Nissan estimates, this system will make its entry in cars manufactured in series in the next ten years.
Another application might be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination while avoiding the obstacles on his way.
One even gave a name to overpriced baby.
The written version of the $ 700 billion economic rescue plan, to redeem the doubtful credits of banks, and use several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent.
Reuters announced that during new debates extending until after midnight Saturday, local time from the coast is, Congressional leaders are agreed on the controversies existing for days and days, around the total amount of $ 700 billion rescue plan.
"We have made a serious step forward" - said Nancy Pelosi, the democratic Chairman of the U.S. House of representatives, that there is more to put agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan is supported by the two candidates for the Presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The U.S. Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, said in commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, however other measures still need to be implemented. Of after Pelosi, it is not matter, here, the rescue of Wall Street, but to turn the wheels of the economy in the other sense.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets, Sunday night at 8 p.m. local time in Washington (it is - to - say Monday at 2: 00 in the morning, according to the local time in Central Europe), but caused no spectacular rise in the stock exchanges.
Monday, the House of representatives will be the first to vote the proposed name of the year 2008 emergency economic stabilization Act. Then, his fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are pleased with advances achieved tonight, and we highly appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy" - said Tony Fratto, the door - word of the White House.
Furthermore, the program diverges from the original proposal made by the Bush administration, which she mentioned that $ 700 billion was to be spent only once for the redemption titles on doubtful credits.
From now on, maximum half of the $ 700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billions will be issued immediately after the adoption of the Act by the Congress, probably Monday. This first amount will be the Secretary of the Treasury to buy bad Bank debts, while the use of additional $ 100 billion will be left to the discretion of the President.
The program will be overseen by an independent body, in which the president of the Federal Reserve will take part also.
The expenditure of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of the Congress.
Under the terms of the Act, the Treasury Board secretariat will be able to implement a combined strategy: he can, at the same time buy doubtful accounts, bearing securities on mortgages and bad mortgages, and other types of receivables ", toxic".
Competent persons of the Ministry said that redemptions can take place within the framework of a sale at auction, but also directly.
Rule provides an opportunity for the companies concerned, take part in an insurance program, where the Treasury Board secretariat ensures tools originally concerns, for which companies will be paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson said that the Act provides the tools needed to spend $ 700 billion to the exigency of the financial system, whether large redemption of dubious claims, their insurance, or avoid the risk of causing the collapse of one or the other system important financial institution.
"We will make the necessary arrangements, to be ready for the purposes of the Act, as soon as it is signed" - he added.
On the other hand, the leaders of banks in poor posture and waiting for help from the State can expect that their allowances starting, all called simply golden parachute in addition - Atlantic, will be capped by the Government.
The salary cap is mentioned only in very specific cases. In addition, limitations depend on the manner in which Treasury Board secretariat offers its assistance to the business.
The principle of the CAP means that if the secretariat Treasury bought back as part of an auction, they will take a surplus of tax on the golden parachute, unless discredited Bank president parte retired.
Directly after the purchase of bad loans, the Government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is no exaggeration.
So the image is complete, it must still add the existing golden parachutes are not changed. The CAP applies only to new contracts, this is to and motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the States - United legal caps will be in force concerning the salaries of the Directors-General - said the president of the commission in charge of the financial benefits of the Chamber of Deputies, the Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State provides a right of acquisition of shares in banks taking part in the plan. In this way, the risk of taxpayers decreases, since they may be winning in the case as soon as the economy and with it saved banks reveals on their legs.
Bill mentions that in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal that will decide on how the losses will be returned to the taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were obviously those who have expressed their doubts over the plan.
Is not for this that American citizens were mandated to us, this does not protect the taxpayer dollars - said the California Republican Member, Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur think that they are the same who urge taking of measures, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Next year, it will still need visa to go to the States - United?
Kinga GÃ¶ncz think that there is good chance that to January 12, the americano - Hungarian visa waiver agreement enters into force. This is what the Foreign Minister said in Chicago, to the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
Of after it, "now everything depends more on that from the moment where electronic input and control systems in addition to - Atlantic will be put into service".
All times, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visa, but tourists must register prior to departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be negotiations today in Washington.
He will meet the Foreign Minister, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he shall deliver the decoration of the cross of Commander with star of the order of merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will hold talks with advisers in foreign policies of the candidates for the Presidency, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support both the banks rescue plan.
Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, candidates for the Presidency of the two major American parties, have assured their support the Government's $ 700 billion rescue plan. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of US Treasury Secretary.
After marathon negotiations that lasted for days and days, the representatives to the Congress and the Administration finally announced Sunday at dawn, they have reached agreements in principle on the bailout of the banks.
This financing plan aimed at thawing the Wall Street and the paralyzed credit market crisis, became the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain are even, each as more fit than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
The latest polls, with the highlighting economic issues, Obama has again managed to procure a bit in advance. The advance of McCain, obtained with the nomination of Sarah Palin as his running mate just after the Republican convention, has melted.
At a campaign rally held in Detroit, Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress vote quickly act on the 700 billion bailout plan.
He stressed that the proposal also contains passages from protection of consumers that it supports.
"It is now that we must act with responsibility (...) a danger threat your job, your savings, of entire industrial sectors and the stability of the economy"â stated before a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to describe McCain's outdated economic ideas.
In an interview given to the string ABC, McCain said: "we have all struggled to swallow it (...) "but doing nothing is not a possible way".

The press review of German linguistic territory.
Right camp is intact, is only in the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - it is thus that evokes the Der Spiegel, the low score of CSU in the Bavarian country.
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of red and black.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de).
In the internet edition of the German left news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "the revolution in Bavaria devours his fathers".
This recognized political scientist, the erosion of the CSU has started well before that sad Beckstein - Huber duo takes its functions.
Christian Socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now, it is these same modern citizens who turn them back.
This time change is at the same time the problem of Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not entirely a surprise, but Sunday, has come to end a process that was likely, just ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU is picked up with 47.7 percent, and for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 percent level.
This is repeated three years ago when the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is - to - say at the time of the so mentioned Stoiber.
The cause attributable to modernization "devouring his parents", put in place in the region of consistently by the CSU.
It is 40 years since sociologists announce this but they are strongly wrong concerning the rhythm. However the secularization, the results of education and the establishment of Germans from Northern and Eastern in the Bavaria region, in full development, could not remain without consequence on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization goes hand in hand with the increase of opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and more stubborn.
It is surprising also that during these last weeks, this is precisely conventional citizens groups that are rather far away from CSU, such as the self-employed, craftsmen, bin holders and the higher educational qualifications.
In these groups, support for the CSU fell below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com).
In his article entitled "who? With whom? "The President of party stand on the reserve with regard to issues of the coalition", the conservative Austrian daily deals with the situation of confused internal policy that is installed after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the OPS want to discuss with the Conservatives of the ÃVP.
The ÃVP prohibits the SPO to meddle in its internal affairs.
The populist party BZÃ proved to be open for negotiations. The Greens want yet to reach agreement on the coalition.
The elections were held, now everything revolves around the coalition; during the debates on public television, party leaders barely show their cards.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPO, confirmed that he wished to discuss with the ÃVP.
The SPÃ wants to show that the collaboration of the two parties is actually possible - this is what already exists in some regions and the Socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current Chairman of the ÃVP as vice chancellor, remaining open on the part of Faymann.
As he mentioned, SchÃ¼ssel orientation - Molterer was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the proposals of the reds.
As he has already said, a collaboration will be surely unsuccessful if Faymann attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÃVP.
His party, the choice of the opposition or entry into the coalition is momentarily an entirely open question. These points must absolutely be discussed within the ÃVP.
JÃ¶rg Haider, the Chairman of the BZÃ, is again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the red-black coalition, we are ready to assume governmental responsibilities" - said Haider.
JÃ¡rÃ³ka said: we need to break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation.
Today, began in Paris, the European Summit for equal opportunities, whose host is the France, as representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In his message presentation to the plenary Assembly, as one door - main lyrics of the consultation of experts, LÃ­via JÃ¡rÃ³ka, MEP European people's Party Fidesz, attracted attention to segregation in education, because it is a violation of law that affects most Roma children and thus, one of the major obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened on a hand, by Xavier Bertrand, Minister french labour and Social Affairs, and on the other hand, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner of labour, Social Affairs and equal opportunities.
Persons invited to take part in the consultation, include the European social partners and the most eminent representatives of the legal protection and European civilian agencies in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the Group of the popular member of Fidesz party Press Office, JÃ¡rÃ³ka warned that alongside distinctions noted during hires, Roma disappear from the labour market, in the first place, as a result of their low qualification.
"An overwhelming majority of young Roma are not graduates of secondary, and in consequence of an elementary education of poor quality, only a small part has the opportunity to obtain a graduate diploma".
Furthermore, JÃ¡rÃ³ka stressed that education as a fundamental right of the human being plays a key role when other fundamental rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children means a strengthening of the economy of the countries of the European Union.
MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these reports in a widest possible circle, also between Roma and non - Roma.
Indeed, earlier a Roma child begins school, more it increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from its income and its consumption, he participated in the State budget.
"Due to their citizenship of the European Union, the Roma must be assured of their right to a quality education, and protection from a low quality education and sectarian". -a stressed Livia Jaroka.
Member of Parliament, a collaboration of the European Union, a goal and action-oriented is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of desegregation of schools. To do this, the compliance with the guidelines of anti - discrimination existing and preparation is of paramount importance.
"We need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and without - employment." Must be given the opportunities provided by democracy for Roma children, to enable them to participate as full citizens in the future of Europe"- JÃ¡rÃ³ka required.
On behalf of l ' "European year for equal opportunities" provided for all, the objective of the Summit on equality of opportunity in Europe organized every year since the Summit in Berlin last year, is to ensure a single platform to support the measures taken in favour of equal opportunities and the fight against discrimination, targeted at European level and at the level of member countries.
CSU: grace for a transition period.
It was in October that would be taken the decision on the fate of the fallen duo Huber - Beckstein.
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues to the peaks of the Bavarian CSU was postponed.
The president of the party, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, GÃ¼nther Beckstein, can still keep their place. The question is until when will last grace?
The fate of the tandem, a loss of catastrophic votes by 17 percent, will be in the agenda of the Congress of the party, held the last week - end of October.
In any case, members of this much-criticized pair made feel that they do not specifically held at their headquarters.
Thanks to this, they are used to soothe angry members of the fraction and base, which one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded that the personal consequences for the loss of an absolute majority.
There are five years ago - it's true, still under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - EU socio - Christian won 60.7 percent, while today ' today, a year after the putsch against Stoiber, there remain only 43.4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, the CSU has been l ' "sole ruler" of Bavaria giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But the Conservatives are still strongly in this southern region, important key for the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced to the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal refurbishment of party, vice-President and the federal Minister of agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as possible Huber's successor, also earned a place in this small group of recognition, which initiates discussions groped with the Liberals of the FDP, as well as with the free voters, trained along the right values, about a possible coalition Government in Munich.
Strange nose of fate has been using the list of the free voters, between legislation Gabriele Pauli, whose measurement against Stoiber served as possibility of coup perpetrated by the Huber - Beckstein duo, to then treat the very ambitious municipal politician unceremoniously.
Now, the leaders of the CSU put all of their energy to stabilize, one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who until now pulled the strings behind the scenes, will also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and ex - President of CSU, has designated September 28 as the most bitter day of career politics.
Monday, Huber launched some scathing remarks to the CDU. According him, they deserved much more support on the part of the sister party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also to Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel may again be Chancellor unless they hand over on foot one way or another, with a joint force, the CSU, who played an important role in the national success of 2005.
From Merkel, hardly hiding his disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of the CSU will not negatively influence the grand coalition in Berlin.
Yet what is relative because it is not easier to manage CSU wounded, and the crisis of socio - hard Democrats always.
Since 1946, the SPD reached its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - rivals: 110-0.
No member of the opposition agreed with the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's elections.
After Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexandre Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by illegalities committed during the counting votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislature composed of 110 people in this country of 10 million inhabitants is going very well of opposition for long decades, before the elections of yesterday, the opposition uniting his forces under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped seriously as Lukashenko, renewing his tenure as president for the fourth time in questionable elections, in the footsteps of the amendment of the constitution in 2006"would allow" this time - above the presence of some members of the opposition in Parliament.
In this way, the ODSZ gave up his boycott planned originally.
The fact that the Belarus dependent economically more and more the Russia would improve its relations with the EU, where because of the Belarusian political order as undemocratic, Lukashenko and several politicians high places don't get entry visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition. The Belarus has of taking a credit due to the reduction of imports of Russian natural gas still more expensive, and has thus contributed to the passage of the company Beltransgaz, owner of gas lines across the country, is passed to the hands of the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, during the evaluation of the campaign, put emphasis on the positive rather than deficiencies, changes as for example the ban to stand for a third of the opposition candidates, refers to a prior appeasement.
However, the press release of the OSCE on Monday already challenged the campaign, during which most of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present at the counting votes.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the polity: political prisoners regained freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, always refusing to recognize South Ossetia and the Abazzia separated from the Georgia. However, the Russia with which the Belarus formed a confederation on paper, considers the two independent territories since already a month.
"We made two steps forward and one step back, but the most important is that the dialogue initiated between the Belarus and EU" - Alexandre Milinkevitch told our newspaper.
After the candidate for the opposition of the presidential elections of 2006, it is desirable that this remains so, despite the fact that "power has been afraid in this Parliament which has no weight, to bring even a single opponent".
The opposition does not actions of protests in the light of the results. She tries rather to send his message on the need for economic reforms to the electorate.
"Of course, we have many worries on this side - there: we need to print our opponents newspapers in Russia, local authorities put us sticks in the wheels in the broadcast, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of the elderly"-said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that in the current regime of Lukashenko, who considers social security as its main result, the layer of the more sustained pensioners officially is considered really as appropriate.
"Because of the debt of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'referring to the silence of a cemetery', is no longer only a matter of time" - considers Milinkevich.
Unlike the politician of the opposition, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, leading the mission of the community of independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "the people do not believe in words, but in acts".. In this way, the absence of the opposition is that the proof of the maturity of the Belarusian electorate.
Brunetta: 'starting today, breakfast before work".
Never, in the history of Palazzo Chigi, not had a revolving door for the entry and exit of employees.
But from today, is in force this new measure against the crafty, against which points and will then drink coffee at the bar during working hours.
The lazy anti novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary general of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"Revolving doors - said Brunetta - are an instrument to better work with more productivity, more attendance and services" specified by the Minister.
Now begins a new season of responsibility and transparency.
"It's reformism" underlines Brunetta.
The installation in all institutions of the Presidency of the Council is completed with Palazzo Chigi.
According to Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is important even a symbolic point of view.
No resistance on the part of employees was recorded, assures the Secretary-General: "it is a process shared by employees, and we had the collaboration of all".
In short, most small lunch during work hours; more coffee or growing.
Promise of Brunetta, which suggests with a smile, "a good cappuccino at 7 o'clock in the morning is an excellent and safe resolution".
At a conference at the superior school of Public Administration.
In Rome, the Minister communicates that in three months, public employee absences are reduced by 50%, or 60milles workers more in one year "."
And he added that it is essential to make more effective public Administration.
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - says the Minister - last 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and well in addition to the rate of inflation."
At the same time, thousands of public employees, have joined forces to challenge the standards of Decree Brunetta making recourse to the Codacons.
"" While the Minister of public service today spreads the data reduced absenteeism in the workplace due to illness - written the association of consumers - the people of the "active idle" continues to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of employees of Public Administration correct and productive, gathered to declare war on illegitimate standards contained in the Decree.
In particular, to the Tar, it disputed the exclusion of additional allowances in the event of disability of service; the extension of home permanently of the ill worker hours, during which are conducted monitoring visits, as well as other aspects contained in the new arrangements by the Minister.
Accidents in the workplace, Napolitano: "Crucial Prevention".
Every day, in Italy, there are 2,500 accidents work, 3 dead and 27 people who remain disabled permanently.
In 2007, Inail data confirm, that the white dead were approximately 1,200.
Figures which testify to the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes nearly two times more deaths than homicides.
For the attention of institutions, social forces and the media on this dramatic aspect, the Anmil celebrates today, all the Italian provinces, the 58th day national victims of accidents on labour, institutionalized the second Sunday in October.
"The disturbing data disseminated by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention in the workplace," says the president of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the president of the Anmil, National Association of the maimed and disabled work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of State expressed his "sincere appreciation for associative continuous effort in favor of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of the victims and the sensitization of public opinion".
"Naturally indignant, everyone hit the fist to put an end to such tragedies which, due to their size, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of the public, even if reality presents drama, even repetitive cases in their dynamic.
Napolitano does not hide qu ' "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in the training and information".
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector, assume particular importance for more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, maintain attention towards this phenomenon does not sub evaluate alarm on social gravity, apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the president of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed how "this phenomenon of the white dead is an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and requires all the institutions to make a concrete effort to put an end quickly".
Injured on the job data seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not preclude that the number of dead white is still impressive "said later the president of the Anmil Pietro Marx.
"We do not wish that this" tendency to discount "is actually translated into a minor attention, because it is precisely when the attention relaxes, what the tragedy."
"We believe that, in General, is not enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions".
"We believe - stressed Marx - more controls and inspections are necessary, just like an intervention more important on the training of workers, and this, beginning in school".
-He added - "that should still make an effort with regard to communication and awareness of the public opinion.
"But it is necessary above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers facing a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
"Marx was then denounced" the progressive deterioration of the conditions for the safeguarding of the compensation provided for victims of labour "and the"drift assistance". to which the system is oriented in recent years
"Therefore, aims to restore the worker coverage - there added - so that the fate of one who has an accident, should not depend on the spontaneity or the enlargement of the legislature".
Pointing the finger Mp3 player, they put at risk the hearing.
Listening to music at full volume for a long period using portable music devices such as Mp3 players, can cause permanent damage to hearing.
This is what informs the European Commission, citing the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on unforeseen and newly identified health risks (Csrseri) of the EU, in a statement released in Brussels, published today.
"This report scientific - we read in the note - it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music at full volume using portable music devices, for more than an hour per day and per week, risk permanent hearing loss".
"I am concerned that so many young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at full volume, can unknowingly damage their hearing in irreparable way" says Meglena Kuneva.
"" According to data scientists - continues the EU head - it's a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What matters most is to educate consumers and make such information in public domain.
We must also review the existing control systems given the scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and to monitor new technologies "."
Brussels has asked the independent scientific committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise that those - ci.
"The scientists - concluded the EU Executive - confirm that there is good reason to worry, and that the European Commission will examine now with Member States and other interested parties, what measures could be possibly taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from music devices laptops and similar devices."
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but anxiety increases about hearing damage that may derive from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to well to limit these data making recourse to solutions such as reducing the levels and duration of exposure to noise.
The Scientific Committee the EU notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed limits currently in force relating to the level of maximum noise made in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods, risk permanent hearing loss after five years.
This interest 5-10% of users of these devices, and their numbers may be quantified at around 2.5 to 10 million people in the U.E...
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to leave the Commission for the future of the capital.
Today we start, we finish in March, in June we will draw money.
Here the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the future of Rome capital", which took place this morning, to the new seat, behind the baths of Caracalla.
In six months, president Antonio Marzano and 49 other components of the Commission will develop guidelines for Rome.
In March when they have finished, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so as to present the Strategic Plan for Rome in June, with "official stamp" of the Capitol and its Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"" The commission is absolutely independent. all political, social and cultural ideas are represented - wishes to emphasize Alemanno - it will have to propose ideas for development of Rome which can be used by policy makers, who remain the Committee and the Municipal Council.
No overlap of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to develop a project for Rome.
In March, it will have finished its tasks and will then disappear, as this experience must have a specific time duration.
June - announces the Mayor - we will present the strategic plan from the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome capital. ".
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, because his opinions are binding, Alemanno replies: "everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as elsewhere in Rome, I am on, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overwhelmed by the management of everyday and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, we want to see from the front, and later, to a deeper prospective working seriously to Rome and its future development "."
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wishes to emphasize that "this Committee is not a useless body nor a bureaucratic set: it is absolutely free, and won't cost one euro to the Roman citizens, and will be used to study and engage the best intelligence that express the capital."
Alemanno, indeed, "to a draft reference strategic, neither firm nor stationary, to allow our city to improve, which she absolutely needs, while thinking about his future now a unit spirit".
A future which, says the Mayor of Rome, "is not limited to usual municipal borders, but which will further look" not only in the perspective of future metropolitan city and its legal status of capital, but "over the role that Rome can and must be, as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The president first, anti - American. That is why.
A famous American politician who wishes to go to independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second president anti - American.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, from part its decisions, destroyed the USA economy and had reports (as indeed there still today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam "."
Attacks on Obama while the election date draws nearer.
A lady from Miami wrote on a web site: "this person is full of ambition".
Obama's really cheeky: he believes he will win the highest function of a nation that has, two governors and five black Senators! ".
In reality, it's attacks that don't say much; These are obviously racial attacks, and do not respond to the question of all voters: it will be a good president? We have in addition the polls, claiming that Obama will win, and with a good advantage.
In this case -, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not the brain.
A journal of the Mississippi, in the bowels of the southern States - United, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know well who the American Patriot will give its vote.
This is that emerges an aspect of the American mentality kept secret until the end.
"Say what you want, we will we see even to the cross, on Obama or McCain."
There are even people who swear: If Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed until now, to the point that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Anyway, despite all these arguments, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his tenure? 89 per cent replied: Iraq.
America changes.
In Viet Nam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home she kicked ass.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans have not been forced to pack the bags.
Despite this, Iraq was, for most, the point of weakness of Bush.
Who will take the place of George w. will be a huge task at hand.
USA, the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is the time of deletions. And many accuse Internet, this "murdered" newspaper.
Five hundred American journalists were detained by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mind control for the future.
And well, almost all journalists are now pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not declare openly the information ties, feeling less worried about credibility.
They feel not isolated as formerly.
The problem of American journalists, this is money, the money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a model destroyed economic crisis.
In addition, deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to assemble newspapers, are a big problem.
This is a problem which must be solved, according to the interviewed journalists, if you want that traditional journalism as the public understood, only reduces substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism invaded the American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and journalists from newspapers for printing are convinced that journalism at national level is trying to follow a wrong path.
Locally, the Executive Group is 65%.
Publication printed against broadcast.
Journalists have not hurt to see where goes the web.
The largest houses editors to spawn a passage to the Internet, perceived by many as "the assassin" newspaper.
"Economic pressure" that feel journalists is increased up to 79%.
500 interviewed journalists admitted getting into technology hoping to "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest hitch in American journalism lies between which run the newsrooms - IE - - directors - and reporters who work for them.
56% of managers at the national level, are convinced that the reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is related to the "labour safety".
Directors who think losing their posts in the space of 3 years, are 47% at the national level.
With regard to journalists, we go to 30%.
That the "safe working" level staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still the order of the day.
Only 13% of journalists working under contract.
In a vast nation like the Usa, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, journals, radio, TV and Internet, employers offer often what they want, and it quickly becomes a question of take or leave.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor may earn 10 thousand dollars per month, in addition to retirement and payment of insurance.
On holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, spent a number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists, are often "ill" during the year.
It is the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL: COURT ROME, DANILO COPPOLA REST HAS GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second Penal section of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to dismiss the proceeding of estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to leave his town, Grottaferrata, for a residence in Rome.
. Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy under the Unipol - Bnl climbing instruction.
During the trial his dependants, last week, he had obtained release home transformed into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate agent can make the journey of the provincial town to a home in the capital.
In the tribunal's view, such displacement (that the pm has not granted) would enable it to influence his company and to have access to evidence that accuse him.
The elites in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of representatives, contrary to the $ 700 billion rescue plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans was, and is still, more interested in punishing Wall Street to save the American economy.
And it is the New York Times yesterday that confirms us communicating that the current crisis divides the Republican party, yet more shared between its old soul East Coast, moderate, favourable to the Government as well as the business community, institutions and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to"Washington" and the world of finance, especially in the States of the Centre and South.
The soul, precisely, who was feeling despotic way with the vote I mentioned at the beginning.
However what comes to be cited is only an example of the changes, big changes that the earthquake economic current preflashing or well is already running: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and may be not only here.
In the United States and Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate phenomena brooded for some time, to such a point that, in the new climate, they solidify and reveal themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the refresh, the extraordinary revival of the dual category State-sovereign over a sort of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of bank - financial institutions which were obviously close reports abroad, but which, above all, are involved large scale assessments of individuals and families who live in one country, in a single State.
This immediately creates a political problem for which governs: IE as respond to difficulties and protests of people and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears world economically but politically, it is almost that here national.
Political internationalization seems really out of play or well, is not much to say: the proof is provided by the European Union which, shared as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, can't decide no common political line.
And so, it is the Government of each State that all expect intervention, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and especially a condition of credit: when it passes through a difficult period, there is that those States which possess the economic resources, the mass of resources able to try to put things in place.
They also possess the necessary means and the legitimation to use: two resources invaluable elements for which no market or international organization can never have in a similar way.
This new emphasis of the crisis State - nation is the rest in perfect harmony with the still major importance that the latest economic developments of the economy tend to be attributed to a factor somewhat related to this element: territoriality.
. Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced to be now entered into the realm of the network, of ever more sophisticated, of the non-technology hardware, convinced that the globalized finance was now intended to dominate the world, we went a shot of a single account, that our future should instead settle accounts still more with things pretty little material such as watercrops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another of Earth, but which are linked definitively to a space limited to a territory.
Thus, which is sovereign, has certainly more cards than that which is not, it is - to - say, one who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvesting, oil or water.
I turn now to the second novelty which however provides for a fracture.
Who says territory, State, Government, inevitably said political, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the conscience of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, looking for someone who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other side, a wave of discredit to the existing leadership, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of grey area.
And Moreover, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even disturbing: a discredited, suffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of remoteness that tends to involve the whole class of Directors in a growing number of countries of the West.
So still more increases the conviction of various classes, before actions are the same ideas of social far elites at their peak, their ways to listen to and be, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be still more alien to the opinions of majorities.
In short, the request of leadership, feeds underground way, a powerful and movement of dÃ©lÃ©gitimassions of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which are manifested in the electoral "revolts" improvised or well, in the collective moods of these changes last time, from the conservative ascent in Austria Bavaria, the fall of the labour party in Great Britainthe rebellion American delegates against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the right in Italy has not happened by chance).
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, looks like someone, always have more than fix, which does not date from today, to understand and therefore represent the deeper Western societies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and agitates potentially disproportionately.
Talk about a current "rebellion of the masses" in view of all this, the order of the day, seems frankly exaggerated.
But they say well, keep eyes wide open, it is not without reason.
The Superglue to walk on walls.
Defeat the laws of gravity with a super glue and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
That is the goal of various American research centres, and today, a team of four institutes is almost succeeds.
With an adhesive was barely 2.5 square centimetres, researchers have succeeded in maintaining a corps of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall glued.
The study - the American journal Science published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, of Akron, of the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular structure of carbon, called nano carbon tubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti". Says Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that ensure the animal, a perfect Lady.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and sandpaper, have demonstrated that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time that it "easily detaches from the wall" said Liming Dai, researcher of the Faculty of engineering of the University of Dayton.
WALK ON WALLS? -"this material could be used as a temporary adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
May be to walk on the walls like Spiderman? May be Yes, but researchers think much less fascinating use such that the connection between electronic devices, because the nano carbon tubes are heat and current drivers electric.
Other applications may affect the aerospace engineering.
For the moment, not super heroes.
OTHER research - the University of Berkeley, California, devoted she, looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American magazine American Chemical Society, Californian researchers presented an adhesive composed of microfibres and hair, that if auto cleans dust during movement over an area to ensure a perfect and constant adherence.
Drugs: never with fruit juices.
Beware of grapefruit, orange and Apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summertime because thirst quenching and rich in vitamins, if associated with certain vital medications, adversely affect the absorption increasing or decreasing depending on the case, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, Professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, said the risks of the fruit juices, canned or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236eme national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway in Philadelphia, he launched a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit, orange juice and apples, to reduce the absorption of vital medications, canceling their beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice has already been strongly criticised as retained Manager to increase the effects of some medicines anti arrhythmic, antibiotics, anti-anxiety, anti stem and neurological, up to toxic levels.
MEDICATIONS A risk - this is the Italian medicines agency it even, which gave the news in a newsletter dated two years alerting doctors and patients to do not sub evaluate the risk level deriving from this mix and to pay attention to what we drink, if you take medications such as e.g., Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT that the GRAPEFRUIT - According to the experts, even orange and Apple Juice contains substances that inhibit drug.
Long is the list of the active agents inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, the appeal of Michele Carruba, Director of the Department of Pharmacology at the public University of Milan: "these findings are in general, immediately reported to the various national and international drugs agencies who will have to, change the informative notes to the drugs.
Should always read the papers illustrative of the drugs that are taken, and, if something is not clear, do not to impress, but speaking clearly to the doctor or the pharmacist "noted the expert to the Ansa agency.
The Nobel in economics to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in economics was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his research on trade patterns and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo - Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and he is also a famous columnist of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the solutions in economics and foreign policy of the Bush administration.
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, during the days of the collapse of Enron, Krugman wrote in an article published on the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of impact on the history of the States - United.
A forecast that unleashed many polemics, and which was charged to the Economist for years, but which now has proved to be accurate.
"I'm surprised and even a little shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom, disappeared from the public's attention" Krugman said at the end of 2002.
Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "valuable Economist", but also a discloser style "very aggressive, especially critical of the excesses of the liberalism of the Bush administration.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti - Microsoft" package.
It is the day of dissemination of OpenOffice.org.3.0, subsequently open source personal productivity which aims to reach still more users, from home to the office, public administration professionals, offering a free alternative to the more famous Microsoft Office.
Upon a work of almost ' one year, directed by volunteer developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package proves to the public with several new features: from the Welcome screen, and interface review and become less austere, with other more important, as born to the operating system Apple Mac OS X compatibility, and support for the new format ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2the latest ISO standard release.
Open Office especially paid attention to the interaction with the suite Office 2007, and it is indeed possible to open documents with the new extension to Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Also interesting, specific to some functions modules, as one that lets you reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send by e-mail, or to import PDF file in the graphic development module, maintaining the original appearance of the page.
Still on this front, it is possible to create 'Hybrid PDF' documents that bind the typical chart in Adobe format to elements of a worksheet or to a producer of text.
The collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements inside applications: in the worksheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflict on the changes in the drafting of texts, because each employee is assigned a color of comments for a better recognition in the phase of revision.
Some companies are even working to bring some features of OpenOffice on the Web (on the cloud, the cloud), and in the next few weeks, they should emit the final result.
The Italian version is downloadable at http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.htmlet and if added to the version English which was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual available in addition, for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation cd can be shipped at home or in the workplace.
And if the theme of free can be a way to be broadcast in homes, it is precisely in the business, that Open Office suite tries to the great challenge, which can already count on various projects within the public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities which offer a training service, consultation and assistance, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open to a prospective business.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for writing video equivalent of Word; Calc, is the worksheet that is intended to replace Excel; Impress, to rival PowerPoint presentations; DBASE, as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on the databases; Finally Drwa is the graphic module.
Goal for 2008, reaching 5 million download, and considering that today ' today there almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the planned figure.
Kohl is also positive, it is the fourth doping case.
New cases of positivity to the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the Jersey of the best climber.
It is the site of the L'Equipe newspaper that reported the new.
At the age of 26, Kohl is the fourth rider positive for Cera, the third generation, after Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli Epo, and German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner.
Blood tests carried out on specimens of Kohl are part of those carried out in recent weeks by the Lausanne and ChÃ¢tenay - Malabry laboratory.
If cons analyses confirm the positivity to the Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the round and must necessarily expect two years of elimination.
The news of the positivity of Kohl in the third generation Epo was confirmed by the head of the Agency French anti doping, Pierre Bordry, who communicated with the Associated Press, have notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The Austrian 26-year-old placed himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, thus winning the polka dot jersey of the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS: NYT SE ASK IF ITALY IS RACIST?
The Italy "as a country of emigrants has turned recently into a preferred destination for immigrants" greeted with reluctance.
This would transform - it the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what has interrogated the New York Times dedicated a lengthy article discussing the topic racism in Italy, the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times describes as "North paradox": the northern regions are both those where "more integration and more work", but also "a sense anti - the strongest immigrants in the country and the most important support for Lega Nord".
To confirm the growing tension between Italian and immigrant, the NYT reference was made also to the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislature desired by the Lega for curbing immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as proof of the change of climate in Italy.
Trend underlined by the Pope as well as by the president of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano in his meeting with Benedict at the Quirinale, asked what the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Students victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
Rentals for students market knows no crisis.
According to the latest survey of Sunia, the Union of tenants, rent a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euro in Milan, Florence, Naples 650 700, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding entire classes of young people, the right to the study because of the high overall costs that families of origin must support - explains the head of the office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities, the high demand on the part of students has so distorted the market that a generalized increase process began even for residents."
In most cases, the rental offers also incorporate a series of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, without limit of rent, sub - rentals.
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of taxation, are needed to calm prices.
Reading in detail the investigation, we see in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, to about 450 euros; for a single room, it ranges from 650 euros minimum (zone Bande Nere), to an average of 800 (Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 euros (area Vittoria).
Florence, a bed costs on average, 350 / 400 EUR, a Chamber about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, must be 250 / 280 euros for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to Central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), asked about 600 euros for a mere 450 for a bed in a double.
Slightly lower values (550 euro for a single) for areas close to other universities (Ostiense and CinecittÃ ).
You can save only if moving away in outlying areas: 300 euro for a bed, and 450 for a simple area Predestina, Centocelle or similar.
In Naples, a bed to 300 / 400 euros, for a simple, one spends from 400 to 600 euros, with highest prices in areas Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Bridget.
At Bari, for bed, it takes 250 / 350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In the smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a major importance in the urban economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, where locations are often taken by community extra students, there is a further anomaly: the rent charged to foreign students is increased by 25 / 30% compared to that applied to the Italians.
Goodbye old cinema Paradiso, cities put the historic rooms.
Historic movie theatres closed for the Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas is blind, it's like a face without eyes".
The image offered by the Director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates what happens in major Italian cities, but also in the cities of province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the outskirts of large multiplex, and the death of consumption of single rooms in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that seems inevitable and undeniable; He has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
Disappear, are often loaded from memory, and historical places "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone that we know, with which we have shared a long way and so many emotions" is the Director of the Nuovo cinema Paradiso film offering Tornatore it 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the juror Cannes, and who recounted the poetry of a room of province, and nostalgia for a way of life cinema, lost can be forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of traders, want to tell all: these past five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and these are the rooms of the main cities that in especially paid the fees: 10 fewer in Florence, Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 Palermo 9.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilie Romaine is leading with 82 cinemas mono rooms lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence that proves t that the primary responsibility for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, as are the three Italian regions which have registered the most new multi-screen cinemas: 195 screens more in Lombardy these past five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia Romagna.
"The Italian operation grew irrationally" notes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it would ensure the survival of those that already exist, as when a room close to a town, these frequenteurs are not necessarily all willing. to go to the multiplex
Not to mention the deliberation missed the credit for traders: the antecedent debt of the State is of approximately 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect the existing laws.
To support the sector, should be between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that concerned about these closures, has decided to resolve the situation with the signing of a protocol between City Hall and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote cinemas mono rooms of historic centres and outskirts.
Among the standards laid down, there are measures of tax concessions for the managers and the benefits to the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the limited traffic area, and will have special rates for parking lots and in some car parks.
"It is an initiative which me please" observes Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna implementing other measures.
It is however clear that, to contrast the super power of the multiplex, the traditional rooms must also improve the quality of the sound and the image, because the public today is more demand.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important for me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New cinema Paradiso" which I thought already since 10 yrs.
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale, now closed, there where I have both lived of shared emotions, I turn the other side for not seeing the signs blackened by dust.
Links between policy and ' ndrangheta, order Mayor of Gioia Tauro. "
"The Mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choice of the town hall to the interests of the Patel clan."
Of heavy charges are initiated by the magistrates of the Direction antimafia of Calabria, to the Mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, and Rosario Schiavione, and the Mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The knobs also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his grandson Attorney, namesake of the boss, already sentenced for conspiracy of type mafia, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"An affront to the normative legal and moral, and especially the good meaning" write prosecutors, two local Governments had expressed willingness to pay to master Piromalli consultations.
"So it would have been granted to the clan - write the judges-to enter officially inside town halls facilitating opportunities, already considerable, monitoring and orientation of public administration".
President of the regional Committee of Calabria Agazio Loiero, does not hide that of "collusion between local committees and organized crime, there more than one" in his region: "there are places where the intensity mafia is more strong than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest '. "
This morning arrests follow those of last July, after which the police announced decapitated the Patel clan.
As soon as late April last, the Municipal Council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved; already in 1991, and still because of alleged packaging between organised crime and the local administration, local politicians had unloaded their function to administer the city.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, Mayor of the SVP at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed head of a coalition of centre right after waivers of May 2006.
He cried scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the Municipal Council.
He accused the Deputy Minister of the Interior at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing him of having engineered all for a political issue, but saw demand for signed incarceration this morning, the judges explained that the Patel clan had even managed to ask the variation of the project of the A3.
Based on interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, pm write, is emergent 'availability to marry the requirements of a businessman, representing a known group, close the Patel, standardizing the choice of public administration in the interests of the clan.
When energy is born from the waves, now the big launch.
This is a disproportionate deposit occupying more than 70% of the surface of the planet and now major global energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, this new renewable sources on which the giants such as Chevron have laid eyes, and now try to put the hand.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea is studied since now hundred years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, the research have intensified.
When the price of oil dropped, around 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was put aside, but now environmentalists instances and the new increase of oil give a great growth sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated in 2007, 15% of the global electricity needs could be covered by the swell of the seas operating systems.
This quantity would be twice that produced by nuclear power plants.
And in addition, there are currents and tides...
Colossi to attack.
The first company to capitalize on a marine energy was the Enersis, which in 2005 has initials an agreement to build a facility north of the Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed a real revolutionary step.
Two years ago, more and more candidates from among these companies has always been dedicated to traditional energy rely on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies - said - spokesperson of a company associated with the American oil colossus, economic daily Wall Street Journal - and evaluates the possibilities to cooperate with us".
The cooperation in question concerns a permit deliberate by the American commission for the energy to give rise to a project of exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if we consider that precisely in Alaska, Usa continue to extract oil, and recently president Bush has implemented a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc.. New York and Ocean Power in New Jersey, which traverse the path of energy coming from the sea, and investments made until today, although their details are known, indicate according to observers, a growing interest.
Tecnologie to upgrade.
Experts will speak a technology still in its infancy, share the fact that ocean energy does not banish fears towards the environmental impact.
At present, systems like those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and do not appear to create big problem to the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, must be used with a higher environmental impact technologies.
"And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other."
The thrust of the waves, that moves the sludge towards the top and bottom, is converted to a hydraulic pressure of pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure spins a turbine which in turn powers a generator.
The energy is sent to the Bank through underwater cables.
For the moment, we have four systems of this kind in the project phase, waiting for a single federal approval and some energy could serve as a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the contrary, already produces energy for a shopping center and parking using six turbines underwater of the East River in New York.
The movement of water at high tide, is turn the blades of turbines, creating a circular movement that powers a generator.
Verdant announced a long list of customers waiting for permissions to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
Particular interest, say - they at the electric power Research Institute, deserves at this time, the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable wind, sunlight, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely the energy of the tides that States like New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, look to the sides, have invested 7 million and a half dollars in 2008 and will invest up to 35 million in 2009.
Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Prize for peace.
US president Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours and be the fourth American president in history to receive the Nobel Prize for peace.

The visit will be his ultimate in the after - noon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
It will be the fourth U.S. president to receive, but only the third who will be awarded the prize inside - even the Committee.
The White House was informed in advance that Obama would speak of the war in Afghanistan during the awards.
The president does not want to avoid this subject because it is conscious that it receives this award by being a president who leads a war in two countries at the present time.
It has strengthened the effort of war a few days ago by sending additional units in Afghanistan, what none of his critics forget noted.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque for 10 million Swedish kronor (1.1 million Euros).
There are donate it to charity, but it has not yet specifically decided which.
His busy schedule then take him and his wife at a banquet including, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the head of the Government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at this price at the beginning.
He mentioned for example feel they do not fully deserve.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for him alone, but for all those who defend the same values.
After the announcement, he said that it would be for him a "call for action".
A defender of the nature accused of blackmail.
Police at LitomÄÅice was charged with blackmailing the president of the association society of protectors of the nature of LitomÄÅice.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several procedures of construction sites and requested money from investors for his personal benefit in Exchange for the withdrawal of its appeal, said Alena RomovÃ¡, door - LitomÄÅice police spokesman.
President of the society of the conservationists of LitomÄÅice is Lubomir StudniÄka.
He is currently in custody and risk up to three years imprisonment.
Waste separation bins are not scented in Brno.
In Prague everybody can sort its packages of drinks, while in the villages of South Moravia you fall on grabs of sort to every street corner.
And in Brno?
There should be that you take several minutes before finding the appropriate dumpsters.
I do not mean that it trierait any waste in Brno.
But I have the impression that Councillors of our city, second largest city of the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the sorting of waste stone age not only because citizens can still sort than paper, glass and PVC, but especially in the light number of bins dedicated to these wastes.
Have - you already tried to throw a plastic bottle in the Center - City?
It is all a science, which requires above all time and nerves of steel.
The only place I've found for the moment, it is the place of Moravia opposite Potrefena Husa.
Mr Onderka and his colleagues do in wish me not, but it seems to me pretty damn little.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city that is not a sinecure either.
And finally, many of my friends do not sort their waste.
Out of laziness.
That makes them a walkers to reach the dumpsters.
It surprises me not their share.
Myself, after a party, I have proposed to go throw some glass and PVC bottles.
Except that I have seen no color dumpster Street Kounicova.
Luckily have - I found the proper place by going take the tram.
That said, waste overflowed.
It is, after all, the centre of Brno, which is supposed to represent the best the city, not?
It is likely that ecology and a so-called aesthetic interest not too the Socialists of Brno.
Them prefer to buy in the city a place in the first League of hockey that shames the city throughout the country, instead to buy a few additional bins and to propose the sort of more matter first for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad to have been able to reinforce my impression with official statistics after having dragged a moment on the internet.
According to the data of the company EKO - KOM, Brno is really the worst of all the South Moravia region.
Paroubek budget was removed from the argentaux retired and sick leave.
After that the left has increased, despite the opinion of the Government, farmers or even officials may that it lacks money for pensions, sick leave, or the housing savings.
But also for the interest on the debt of the State or international judicial procedures.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, said Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social - Democrats and the Communists imposed the increase for some classes, they were based on the fact that the Government will be borrowing for sensitive expenditures, pensions or sick leave. "It is to postpone problems, miner field," Janota said.
Please note that interest payable on borrowed money are increasingly high and need to return sooner or later.
The State has no real choice about which to draw money.
If it does not drop social aid or its expenses, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those that the left has currently increased: firefighters, teachers and farmers.
And later, their children.
People will receive them and should not fear for their pensions or their insurance, including 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a more grand of debt - next year it will not fail therefore 163 billion in funds, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota debt will grow increasingly faster and with it, the interest expenses.
The State will need money to pay the back and it will no longer suffice to slightly increase the VAT or reduce the maternity leave as has been done by the Government in its package anti - deficit.
He will also Miss five billion to complete construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to some groups of voters.
It is mostly already decided and begun sections of which it is not possible to change the plans to possibly reduce costs.
Keep them at most, which is not free either.
This means delay or stop 30 large projects, and the levy of the European funds is also in danger, according to the warning of Karel Hanzelka, door - Ministry of transport spokesman.
The ÄSSD has offered to solve the financial deficit very skillfully - it draw in dividends of the ÄEZ (supplier and distributor of electrical energy), that the State has for the most part and will supply the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is certainly not a bottomless well.
Last year, there are 18 billion which sailed from the ÄEZ into the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay the removal of environmental damage, to complement the retirement accounts or even serve - they reserve for pension reform that prepares.
In addition, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GNP height according to the rules of the EU.
And it is far from being the end of the Carnival of transfers.
The budget for various compensation to the victims of communism and of crimes, or even the housing savings, decreased by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the State may act without this money.
It is a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we anyway the pay notes Janota.
The Minister must then save on the side of the Department, or in the worst case, touch to the budgetary reserve of the Government.
Missing also one hundred million to the project of Fund of State with a value of two billion, which should enable to follow online what are the expenses of each administration.
The first stage will start in January.
If the Minister of finance was not money elsewhere, the project should be stopped and sanctions would take place, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone mastered both operating systems.
In the future, the Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to move from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
Projects that have been revealed seem promising.
Just a button and you switch from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
It is precisely this possibility which is the objective of the American company VMware, which focuses on the development of virtualization for computers software.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can switch between them, you can differentiate them in personal and professional.
Both work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of the company VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
Introduced in November of last year and it has been made a first demonstration a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a version test for journalists, a Smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
It is a Nokia N800 modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously running Windows Mobile and Android systems mentioned.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware works now with operators Europeans and Americans to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to the devices current 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains bothers hoteliers.
The deserted slopes present no problem only to operators of back - slope.
The lack of snow discourages people to book their stays to skiing in hotels and pensions.
Thus, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and new year.
We have many visits on our site.
Surfers travel offers, asking prices but dare not commit to book at the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas, said Martin Jandura, operator of Spindl.Info information portal...
If one wants to spend new year's dreams to Å pindlerÅ¯v MlÃ½n, is better do more too hesitate to book.
If we give priority to the economies and the quality of the accommodation doesn't come then, then it may try to wait a few more days.
Å pindler hotel offer for now only stays of a week for the new year.
I think they'll try again a time to place, but they also menacingly and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decline ", said Jandura.
The Agency's Ingtours of VrchlabÃ­ tourism also offers still beds free for all periods of winter.
The week of Christmas we are interested at the moment, it is not completely sold.
There are still free, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
This is why we have already prepared a few cheaper last minute Christmas holidays ", said the Director's Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi tourism agency may also propose new year in KrkonoÅ¡e, but there are fewer free seats.
The first fourteen days of February depart as well, remaining winter stays are selling moderately.
This year, the interest for winter stays was negatively influenced by the fact that there's still no snow in KrkonoÅ¡e.
People expect it starts to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If tracks overlap during the week, Christmas will also be complete ", think Schiefert."
On the other hand, the occupation of hotel Horizont Pec pod SnÄÅ¾kou is slightly higher than last year.
There is an improvement of about five percent.
Still us have a few places for the new year as for Christmas.
There is great interest during the holiday of the Polish January and February is selling well too ", informed Karel Rada, Director of the best hotel in Pec."
The Omnia hotel near the central parking of JanskÃ© LÃ¡znÄ is also complete four - twenty percent during the new year period.
Instead, half of the beds remains empty at Christmas in the newest hotel in JanskÃ© LÃ¡znÄ.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already sixty percent of occupation at the present time.
February is a bit lower at the moment but as soon as the snow is going to fall, the interest for stays in the KrkonoÅ¡e will grow yet certainly indicated the Omnia hotel Director, Erik Sporysch.
However, the hoteliers of the KrkonoÅ¡e should not expect more snow.
Thursday it will be cooler and there is precipitation, they should be snowy mountain.

-United States: Repetition is the mother of wisdom.
It becomes even comic, the diligent effort with which Barack Obama, Chairman the reputation of sage, reproduces the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan issue, which he considered him - even though simple.
When he eventually let sweat his doctrine so ardently expected, it has proved that had copied it to carbon paper since the Iraqi scenario for Bush from three years ago.
Not content to use the same text several times the term "as in Iraq", he did not hesitate, more importantly, to use the title of Bush's speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new way forward".
At the same time, he personally criticized the idea of Bush to send new reinforcements in a Iraq consumed by the war as being "irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences".
The following months showed, however, that the Bush strategy, which emanated from the recommendations of the commanders of campaigns, was the only possible and likely success that newspapers at present speak any of the Iraq.
This has not improved the reputation of Bush, it said, objectively speaking, he left his successor a final much more favourable situation that one could not hope.
Barack Obama hope that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again.
Again are the commanders of campaigns who asked him an increase of the military contingent, including the Commander of the Afghan operation, general Stanley McCristal, who even harshly criticized the reluctance of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
He requested 40,000 troops in order to make the more favourable situation.
The president has hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better option, he at least tricked the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to extricate the promise of 5,000 additional on the part of Europe, even if he had 10,000 originally.
Which brings the most problems in any Obama policy seems to be its intention to withdraw the armies of Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete this process within three years. The doctrine of Obama brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that an increase in half will bring the same fruits as the progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organised and its leaders honor the agreements.
The Afghan situation is distinguished by the exact opposite - we can count on nobody and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to change of leader on the day the day according to what suits them.
Political, although institutions that officially based remain the powder in the eyes behind which are going to proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is singularly difficult to balance the interests of various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity as to the reports, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the Foundation of a "prompt to act State", which is the goal of the operation database, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of the Obama strategy perplexing because his voluntarism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan was getting worse and she is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a heart out of reality and purely romantic can be persuaded that small soldiers sent in the tumult of the war in view of their "prompt return home" are going to take a miracle.
From a political point of view, set a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban see as an indirect American defeat admission.
The last NATO Summit has shown that the will of the Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative.
European politicians don't know or do not want to explain to their constituents what the security in Germany or in Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor able to radically alter the situation is the evolution of the Iran-related events.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and reinforced sanctions have no effect on Iranians, Americans will find themselves faced with the very difficult issue of a resolution of the problem by the use of military force.
Need answer for example at the time when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Each solution of this type will however result in a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
Only patch for Obama is the fact that it remains three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time so that it is working on a new strategy, where celle - ci will prove be a total fiasco.
Executives of the Goldman Sachs Bank will receive more cash bonuses.
Placed top executives employees of the US bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced in response to the heavy criticism over its pay practices.
The Group of 30 chief executives will receive shares instead of cash, they will not be able to resell before five years.
The shares may be withdrawn from the leaders to the case where they would take too many risks.
According Reuters, Goldman Sachs arises thus leader of the effort to link payments with performance in the long term on Wall Street.
I assumed that Wall Street is well aware of the overall meaning that must be taken, said the former investment banker Douglas Elliott company JPMorgan.
The concern lies in the details, he added.
The bank Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after running aside nearly $ 17 billion for premiums in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of the premiums will probably exceed 20 billion dollars despite the announcement today, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, strong banking bonuses have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
The Great - Britain announced Wednesday that it had to affect a single tax of fifty percent bonuses bankers exceeding 25,000 pounds.
The France is preparing similar measures.
This year women received Nobel prizes in all areas except physics.
These are five women, a record number, who received today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf the Nobel Prize in technical disciplines and literature.
In addition to the four scientists there were also Romanian-born German writer Herta MÃ¼ller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider received with their fellow countryman Jack Szostak the Nobel Prize in medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry prize was awarded to Israeli Ada Darwin with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for having clarified the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in economics, Elinor Ostrom American with compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that has no winner this year was the physics.
This award went today scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of fiber optics and George Smith avecWillard Boyle for their invention of the CCD chips, which are currently at the base of all devices digital camera, fax or refracting telescopes.
Each winner received the diploma, the medal Nobel and certificate of acquisition of pecuniary reward.
Celle - ci reaches ten million Swedish Crowns in each category. (approximately EUR 1.1 million).
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward between them.
The long-awaited price Nobel Peace Prize has already been handed this after - noon in Oslo, Norway to U.S. president Barack Obama.
One - ci, in his speech, acknowledged the controversial nature of his reward being that early in his course and that it is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defence of its policy he said that in certain situations the war is essential to achieve peace, even if the price is high.
Janota Minister plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Castle.
President VÃ¡clav Klaus will receive Friday morning by Finance Minister Eduard Janota, who weighs his stay in Government because of his disagreement with the the State budget for next year as it was passed by the Chamber of Deputies.
As budget and may be also Janota position to cabinet will be the order of the day of their appointment - you Friday.
Klaus also criticized the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which dig more the crisis of public finances.
It is gate - presidential speech Radim Ochvat, who was informed of the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his position Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget that will be submitted for signature by Klaus, it is a deficit of 163 billion kroner that the Czech Republic should manage.
However, the Chamber of deputies confirmed Wednesday the proposals of the left as money transfers and increased payments of officials, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government alleged that the proposals of the Social Democrats that they would increase indirectly the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the Government, Klaus and the right on the other hand, disagreement which calls into question the future of the Fischer cabinet, which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ÄSSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as voted by the deputies, removes package of savings measures passed by the Government of Fischer and who should he stem the indebtedness of the State.
Klaus, who can ratify the law on the State budget but that nothing obliges, said today at a small - lunch discussions with entrepreneurs, that policies have long neglected the "serious problem" of "uncontrollable disability" of public finances.
Now there, according to him, no favourable solution.
Only a strong Government could bring an improvement, if he could rely on a broader political consensus, according to the president.
The Chairman of the ODS Mirek TopolÃ¡nek has indicated that the budget is staggering and that the Government should call into question its future existence.
The vice - president of the ODS Petr NeÄas told the ÄTK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ÄSSD, the ODS and the Greens working clearly.
In its reaction, the Prime Minister Fischer described as such words of "drastic verdicts".
The head of the ÄSSD JiÅÃ­ Paroubek reacted against Topolanek, saying that the deficit of the budget prepared for this year by the former Government of Topolanek is staggering and it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
Wednesday already, the ÄSSD described as successful ratification of the budget of the State for the next year.
The people's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film.
Despite criticism that the main roles are played by Americans, the South - African actors say that the new film by Hollywood Invictus - undefeated expose to the world many things about the country, its struggles and victories.
The story is about sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, American actor awarded Oscar, embodies the film on the life of Nelson Mandela, indefatigable fighter against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and first black president.
Freeman said that it is a four - twenty - eleven years old Mandela who asked him to embody it in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I told him: 'if I incarnate, I should be able to see you personally...
For example, the actor aged sixty - twelve years which has been awarded a prize for her role in the drama Milion Dollar Baby by Clint Eastwood in the middle of the boxing played the leader of a movement against slavery become him - same slave, a fictional US president, or even God in the movie Evan all - powerful but never someone still alive and also important for so many people that it is Mandela.
The ex - statesman South - African was jailed 27 years for his hard work in the favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for peace.
Invictus is a latin word meaning undefeated and is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of Nelson Mandela and the southern rugby team captain - African FranÃ§ois joint efforts to unify the country. Newly elected president Mandela knows that his country is still divided racially and after apartheid economically.
He is persuaded to unite his people through sport and decides to unite rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world.
The South - African team eventually advancing in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to bring the story of Mandela on the big screen.
I had no other purpose otherwise play this role so as to move it closer than reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge for me was of course to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shakes hands, I recover your energy, it is transmitted and I felt I know how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film FranÃ§ois Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which he has a majority of white players.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard middle of rugby.
For him, his first encounter with Pienaar to his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I rang at the door of the House, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar has been: ' I look much bigger in the film '. "
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the leadership of Director Eastwood received positive notices and speaking even of ambitions for the Oscars.
The criticism of movies Todd McCarthy of Daily Variety newspaper summarized its assessment in these words: "This is a very good story, a very well done film".
In evaluations of movies on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent of positive appraisals.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians were testing a rocket.
A strange light phenomenon of unknown origin above the Norway was observed.
The Russian Defence Ministry acknowledged that yesterday have tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian borders.
However the launch has yet been a failure and the type missile "Bulava", which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army gradually becomes the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His presence repeated tests of the rocket did not the intended effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, Bulava flown, or it is damaged in flight..
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" and the "missile that does not fly".
A missile which does not fly but shining.
This 13th test took place normally at the beginning.
It is at the end of the flight that he had again damage on the equipment.
It is clearly the engine of the third stage of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew du sous - marin nuclear Dmitrij Donskij, which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be precisely set on fire of a boat in motion and immersed.
This is the reason why the mysterious light above the Norway caused by an unidentified flying object precisely likely was by a faulty "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians have not doubted a moment that this is a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time -, it cannot speak absolutely of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket resisted and the damage affected only the third.
In the previous cases, the engines have experienced failures on the first floor.
Even if none of the test launches went smoothly, the Ministry of defence considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This almost fifty percent success rate therefore fills the generals of optimism and they therefore always say that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will carry even 10 Hypersonic nuclear cores with a total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov signed a one year contract with CSKA Moscow in 51 years.
The legendary Defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will be again in a professional game in 51 years.
The former champion of the world, Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup will lend a hand - strong in his team of CSKA Moscow in need and entering probablementdeja in the Friday match against Petrograd.
Fetisov, who ended his career with forty years in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After the injury to Denis Kuliash we urgently need another Defender.
Fetisov trains regularly and is agreed to help the team.
We still need to adjust some details on the form, said the coach of the club Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP Agency.
He did not specify if the comeback of the legendary hockey player will only involve a single match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of the other players, said Nyemtchinov.
From AP, in the case of his back on the ice, Fetisov became the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary striker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and got 15 goals and 26 assists.
The eldest of the famous quintet Fetisov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among those having the most successful.

In the second part of his career, he was also tributes in NHL where twice he held the Stanley Cup.
He is member of the Hall of Fame of hockey since 2001.
Hyundai has listened to unions and voids all overtime.
Hyundai in NoÅ¡ovice plant management is being agreed with trade unions to cancel all overtime.
It is because of frequent overtime unions have declared a State of emergency Monday strike.
The door - Word Petr VanÄk of the Hyundai plant was confirmed.
The direction however wants to still reach agreement with trade unions on Saturday worked this year yet.
We cannot renounce our production plan, it is essential, it is for it that voluntary overtime have proposed Saturday, December 19, knowing that there are two teams, said VanÄk.
SedmiÄka.cz site said the company proposed a bonus 400 CZK employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will be awarded also retrospectively for the day worked on 28 November.
The company, according to VanÄk, decided to change how to motivate employees in Exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for hours and more, they can ask a replacement leave on 28 December and thus prolong their year-end celebrations track VanÄk.
In addition to this all present employees on Saturday will receive a compensation for transport costs and for their lunch.
Given that the additional hours were the point the most urgent and the hottest in comments and claims of trade unions as employees who have spontaneously ceased production last week, management took the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, said VanÄk.
Until last week, the car factory employees were forced to work almost daily two hours of overtime in addition to their eight hours.
Trade unions have cancel the State of strike after signing of the agreement.
Following negotiation between the direction of the automobile plant and the unions must take place Friday after - noon.
The trade union leader Petr KuchaÅ said Wednesday that they were ready to stop the State of strike in the event of agreement on their demands and signing of a joint document.
The situation in the factory culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to constant overtime.
They were also protesting against poor pay and alleged hazing.
The direction is defended with the fact that employees should work in addition to fulfill the requirements in the production of automobiles.
Announcing the Monday strike, unions have also asked that employees who have ceased production are subject to sanctions.
Unions are asking the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year a compensation of NOK 5 000 (about â¬209) for those - ci.
The Hyundai in NoÅ¡ovice car plant currently employs 2,000 people.
She started the serial production the year last November.
She made approximately 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on the "steadfast" as HIV virus.
A team of Czech and German scientists testing new combinations that can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it is also on viruses that have already developed immunity to the drugs.
In some cases, this reality takes precedence over the fact that the combination is not as intensely on common variations of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at present.
One can nevertheless extend dramatically the lives of patients through a mixture of drugs that inhibit the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
Their consumption however leads to a series of side effects.
The Suppression of this multiplication also effect the development of what is called resistant viruses on which drugs have more effect.
The work of the experts of three institutions, the Academy of sciences of the Czech Republic, the VÅ CHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens a way to cope with the strength of the virus.
They showed that substances called metalocarboranes affect the protein responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are an Assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way of all medications used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of researchers leads them to discover new "improved" substances, on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their links on proteins of the virus.
The metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two cages with multiple walls are formed by atoms of boron, carbon and hydrogen and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A traitor and resistant viruses.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus which is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus division caused by the HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious virus particles.
If you stop the HIV protease, it will also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the researchers explain in a press release published by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic link, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on the HIV protease was tested in test tubes as well as on its resistant variants, obtained from patients infected with the HIV.
On the version common enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on clinical drug, however it did not weaken on resistant versions against which common medications are often ineffective.
The metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are so interesting to explore further combinations towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, said Pavlina ÅezaÄova, Director of the laboratory of structural biology at the Institute of organic chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of molecular genetics of the Academy of sciences.
Dispute over the budget. The ODS took to Fischer, who defends itself.
The Chairman of the ODS (Civic Democratic Party), Mirek Topolanek called d ' "staggering" the budget ratified for the following year and according to him, the Government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should call into question its existence.
The Prime Minister described the words of the ODS of drastic verdict.
He said take time to analyze.
-Word of ODS Petr NeÄas said that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ÄSSD, the ODS and the Green Party was clearly more working.
NeÄas, the head of the Government should decide to ilprend in the Chamber of Deputies support on the minority concerned to fight against the growing deficit, or if he cares to remain in his post with the help of the parliamentary left.
NeÄas has warned that the positions of the ODS and the Social Democrats over the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, with however the proposed changes to the tune of 12 billion kroner included by the left.
The room has increased money for the salaries of civil servants, to the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The grievance of the Government to the proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that the budget deficit increased indirectly.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS has left the room before the vote, obedient thus to the wish of the Government like what a modified budget is a less evil than an interim budget.
Disappointment and futility.
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the Government will still reflect the current situation.
NeÄas believes that if Janota threatened to leave his job as the ratification of the proposed changes, the situation might be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota took make - you Monday with the Prime Minister after passing to the Government:
He said, at the same time, that he wondered if he would remain in his post.
The reason is its disappointment at the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer decided to continue to fight the budget deficit, NeÄas believes that the representatives of the ÄSSD, who have imposed changes in the budget, have no place in the Government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies the other laws increasing the deficit as for example those affecting insurance, pensions or reform of the Act on services.
TopolÃ¡nek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the case of the head of the Fischer Government and Government.
Ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing harmful, said Topolanek in a textual statement since the States - United.
He recalled that the vice - ministers of some departments claim TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
NeÄas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign to face a struggle against the amount of the deficit of public finances, "it is quite logical and correct based on the left-wing majority which is currently in the House.".
That said, it should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I've not been thinking and once it will be the order of the day so I me spend, said from the bed to journalists, the Minister of defence Martin BartÃ¡k, elected Government precisely by the Democrats.
The Prime Minister Fischer flew in the after - noon for a debate of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS has backtracked at the request of the Prime Minister.
NeÄas stressed while the ODS would have probably voted Wednesday against the amended budget if Democrats deputies had not expressly requested to allow the vote on the budget.
We do not have the feeling of being orphans, we are not little children, he responded to a question about if the ODS did not suffer reproaches on the part of the president of the party in the House or in the country during the negotiation of the budget.
I did not notice that my vote would have failed.
I knew already at the point where I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the next months would be a bolshevization of the Chamber and destruction of everything that was positive, reacted TopolÃ¡nek in person.
After the new timetables of the ÄD there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
The Czech railways will suppress or limit certain express or regional trains from December 13 less loaded and to strengthen on the contrary some other.
The total coverage of transportation will fall on the day of entry into force of the new schedules of two percent compared to today.
Most of the charges will not change, including basic rates and the rate reduced.
These are for example the inhabitants of the region of Ostrava which will have more links to the capital, the railways will add a pendolino train.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will be also less fast trains on the line Prague - PÃ­sek - Äeske BudÄjovice, Prague - Letohrad hotline will be drastically reduced.
At the regional level, the greatest decrease in transport concerns the region of Hradec KrÃ¡lovÃ© by eight percent in total, on the other hand Prague and its surroundings can rejoice increased.
Two night on the Prague - TÃ¡bor - Äeske BudÄjovice line trains were also cancelled and traffic of a few express trains on the line Prague - PÃ­sek - Äeske BudÄjovice is reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the major transformations, one can see the introduction of a new direct line of Milovice in Prague: at the moment the inhabitants of Milovice must change at LysÃ¡ nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the suburb Esko system, whose opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between LysÃ¡ nad Labem and Milovice.
Remote lines to the capital will be their final destination in Prague's main station (Praha HlavnÃ­ nÃ¡draÅ¾Ã­).
The ÄD will introduce more rows SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains bound for Å umperk / JesenÃ­k will leave at intervals of two hours.
Travellers will no longer take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
The invoice this year for regional railways: additional SEK 200 million.
Express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of transportation and pay to railway next year in all four billion crowns to set visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are controlled by the regions who will pay for their by a total eight billion next year, knowing that the State will participate in height of almost three billion.
Regional trains are 200 million more expensive this year.
The railways have newly signed a contract for ten years, until now the time was always one year.
Railway who like the system, which also explains that they have not resorted to an increase in price of the vast majority of the tickets.
The changes will only affect the day tickets Net ÄD and the internet discounted eLiÅ¡ka tickets.
For travellers without discount card, Net ÄD price will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
ELiÅ¡ka price depends on newly traveled route, while up there it was valid between cities from one region to the choice and was at a single rate of 160 kroons.
The Filipino rebels still hold more than 50 people, the children have been released.
The rebels abducted today 75 people in the southern Philippines, including some primary school students and their teachers.
It is agency AFP who informed, but who spoke of 65 hostages only.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage was held in the province of Agusan del on.
Reported that about 19 rebels used the hostages as human shields during a leak against the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to agency AFP, the rebels belong to the popular army new (postal code), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According AFP Agency, the police first pursued the kidnappers then caused violence a settling of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law has been declared in the province of Maguindanao in the southern Philippines because of a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November linked to the election, the administration of the Governor he y avait30 journalists.
The Governor of this province in the southern Philippines was arrested following suspicions of involvement in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential lineage of the Ampatuan.

The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman aka Mandela.
The new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood arrives in American theaters in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: NeporaÅ¾eny), and narrae a part of the life of the former South - African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the fighter against apartheid world-famous returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela him - even to embody it.
The second male role of the legendary champion South African rugby was awarded to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film, returns of critics and the public are heard.
Nelson Mandela.
Full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born June 18, 1918, Mvezu in South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for freedom of spirit, in 1993 he then received the Nobel Prize in peace alongside of de Klerk.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great expectations since he was introduced to a time when on the one hand the South Africa is in full preparation for the Cup World football and because the media are agitated by some disturbing news about the increase in racial conflict and discrimination of the inhabitants of the part of the black majority to power.
According to the AP Agency, reactions to the new film are rather positive currently in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations towards the main roles where "strut" of Hollywood stars.
However, Morgan Freeman is using his own words, proud of the film.
I dreamed of this role for many years and I prepared myself well.
I also repeatedly personally met Nelson Mandela to power - as they say - recover his energy, he said during the first official film in Los Angeles.
I think that's a good thing if one has the possibility to remember via the film personality and message of Mandela.
This is the story of the Republic of South Africa, but this concerns every individual he added.
Wear the Jersey of the national rugby team.
The film based on the story of the writer's novel British John Carlin the title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the piece that gave its creation depicts people of the South African human rights advocate during his tenure in the Presidency.
Morgan Freeman so try during the film to pick up two racial groups of a long divided population and the same Nelson Mandela in 1995 he entered wearing the national Jersey of team South Africa on the lawn of the World Cup, that South Africa had won then.
To be shown on the lawn in a swimsuit, which is seen in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had lengthy Ovation fourteen years ago mainly of white audiences and has been recognized by the white population.
Hope that the football championship will manage to unite people again into a single nation, said Chester Williams rugby player, who was in 1995 the single 'black' national team.
It remains to be seen if the tense South Africa situation will improve.
Southern white - African are skeptical, however, as recently told in an interview to LN Christopher Dawson, a fan of rugby who has fled to the Grande - Bretagne.
The Championship begins June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of Crowns in flames in the region of Louny.
A fire has engulfed in the morning a transformer of the company Äeps distribution centre near the town of VyÅ¡kov na Lounsku.
According to LukÃ¡Å¡ Marvan, spokesperson - for firefighters from Usti, there are six units that operate on the fire.
They originally intended to allow the transformer, but they revised their opinions and extinguish the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, a short - internal circuit of the transformer.
No one was hurt, and according to the door - word of society Pavla Mandatova the incident does not endanger operation secure transmission across.
Damages are estimated at tens of millions of Crowns, the exact figure will be known once off fire.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer will be replaced with a new one.
She adds that in ten years of activity, the company Äeps has nothing had similar and that such incidents are isolated.
Supply current electric were not interrupted, said - spokesperson for the company ÄEZ for the North Bohemia SoÅa Holingerova Hendrychova, the functioning of households, Governments and industries has not been influenced by the fire in the transformer station.
A.s. Äeps is the exclusive operator on the Czech territory of transmission systems and of 400 kV and 220 kV power lines.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution substations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from sets of sets of distribution transport and traces of 4339-kilometre lines.
JanÄura will file a complaint for defamation against three prefects of the ÄSSD.
Radim JanÄura, owner of Student Agency, will today complaint for defamation against three democratic social prefects.
And concretely against Michal HaÅ¡ek of the region of South Moravia, against Radko Martinka of the Pardubice region and the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin TesaÅÃ­k.
JanÄura stated in Dvacet RadioÅ¾urnÃ¡l UNMIT.
The complaint relates to the attempt of the company to operate regional railways in some regions.
All regions have however come to sign contracts of long duration with the Czech railways.
All three attacked us and say that made foodies, while it only made an offer for what they wanted them - same.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech railways which is not true because we know the price of the Czech railways that were signed last week.
So it only remains for us to defend us.
It is calumny on the company Student Agency, said JanÄura to the RadioÅ¾urnÃ¡l.
Similarly, he said having evidence that no region proceeded in accordance with European law.
For this, we are preparing a complaint to the European Commission.
HaÅ¡ek considers that Mr JanÄura complaint is the sequel to his media spectacle that serves as free advertising for his company and for his person.
I am of course prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and I call the other prefects to do the same.
I guess this will be an opportunity to demonstrate clearly that it is precisely Mr JanÄura which manipulates public opinion and uses false and deceptive arguments about regional rail transport, said Hasek.
JanÄura has already informed last week that he will invest millions of Crowns in a commercial that will mention the adverse efforts of regions.
He told RadioÅ¾urnÃ¡l without campaign after Christmas and that it intends to resume it after the new year.
He said that the campaign will seek corruption in the broadest sense.
JanÄura began his campaign after that the regions were agree to entrust to the Czech railways the operation of rail services to a command of approximately 150 billion crowns, without bidding.
JanÄura, a way to act is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even led to threats of a member of the ÄSSD JanÄura.
The only threat was that if it did not stop, it could lose our bus licences.
He appeared as a member of the ÄSSD, I do not know who it is but I will not say his name, said JanÄura today in RadioÅ¾urnÃ¡l.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional.
Vaccination against pneumococci will reverse the old habits as soon as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Some voices already, saying mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococci culminate.
The pharmaceutical Institute already defines the maximum price that will pay health insurance for vaccines.
Specialists are also clear in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, the children born last year from the August 2 can be vaccinated for free against pneumococci.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If started vaccination last year or earlier, it will have to pay self - even following vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and the 5th month of the child.
Last year already a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated children against Pneumococcus.
Yet parents paid 1600 crowns or even more for a dose.
Vaccination of young people requires four doses.
Experts estimate that every year health insurance spend 300 to 450 000 crowns in doses of vaccine.
However, they save money on medical care that unvaccinated children would require.
So far the State was spending about 500,000 crowns per year for the vaccination of children.
Reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococci are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including the inflammation of the meninges and blood poisoning.
According surveys in hospitals, there are up to 28 deaths of children less than 10 years caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced reimbursed vaccination.
The vaccination will be compulsory?
There's advice on a possible obligation to vaccination in the future.
From January, it must be settled by insurance and optional.
For example the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf KalovskÃ½ said that a compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
His association promotes since long vaccination against pneumococci.
At an international conference attended by our association, specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
This is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased to have been able to impose at least this.
I think that this is a direction that he must now follow, said Kalovsky.
But the Ministry of health does not change the process of vaccination against pneumococci.
We do absolutely not consider it at the moment, said his door - Word Vlastimil SrÅ¡eÅ.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors.
Hana Cabrnochova, President of the specialty society of pediatricians, recognizes that a vaccination based on the volontariata faults.
If all children were vaccinated, could consider a decrease in vaccinations renewals "In the situation where the vaccine costs one such sum I understand decision making optional vaccination" said however Cabrnochova.
Experts foresee that from next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will be vaccinating their infants.
Vaccination against pneumococci marks a break also the fact that it is the first vaccination of children, which is funded by insurance and not the State.
Cabrnochova explains that insurance should release funds for prevention, they would thus save on any future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves.
This is however linked to the concerns of Pediatricians practitioners, concerning the purchase of vaccines.
The original intent was to buy the vaccines by insurance, doctors receiving them in the same way as the rest of vaccine provided by the State.
Some members feared however that this would allow insurance "deduct the amounts of insurance".
Thus, physicians must buy the products and wait for that insurance will reimburse them them.
According to estimates, pediatricians should individually invest nearly 40 000 kroons per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochova.
The son of an American artist involved in a "theft of Museum".
The son of Frank Frazetta, recognized Illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings for a value of 20 million dollars (12 million GBP) in the Museum of his father.
In Pennsylvania, the police stated that ' Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested while he loaded 90 paintings in his vehicle and a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the entrance to the Museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the news agency Associated Press (AP).
AP quoted an official of the police whereby the young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family feud.
According to a police statement, said Mr. Frazetta Jr., age 52, claims to have been authorized by his father d ' "enter the Museum by any means to transport the paintings to a storage facility", reported the Agency.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denies giving such permission, said the Agency.
Labour defends the budget tax increase.
Ministers have defended the tax increase and reductions in spending announced in the report by pre - Budget, despite criticism from the opposition, business and trade unions.
The Tories have said qu ' Alistair Darling "has failed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about the reduction of the deficit by postponing decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor has also attracted the wrath in tackling low wages and average wages.
Among its key proposals, we can see an increase of 0.5% of the social insurance and a ceiling of 1% of public salaries from 2011.
The wrath of social insurance.
Unions have protested low wages are penalized by a recession which they are not responsible and have warned that "problems" lay ahead.
The decrease in social insurance - that will get about 3 billion GBP per year - has implemented business angry, because according to him, it is a tax on jobs while the objective should be a recovery of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than 20,000 GBP per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
THE REPORT OF PRE - BUDGET MAIN POINTS.
Social insurance will still increase by 0.5% from April 2011.
The economy will decline more than the 4.75% expected this year.
New 50% tax on bankers bonuses.
The increase in the tax on the profits of the company for small companies has been abandoned.
Rebates of taxes of electric cars and wind turbines.
Increase of pensions of 2.5%.
According to Treasury estimates, a person earning 30,000 GBP will lose 90 GBP per year and a person earning 40,000 GBP to lose 190 GBP, while a person earning 10,000 GBP per annum will earn 110 GBP more.
Ministers have said that their goal of halving the deficit before 2013 resulted "from the difficult decisions" but insisted on the fact that 60% of the burden of additional taxes weigh on the 5 first % of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Treasury Secretary, denied a tax increase and stressed that a decrease in expenses was a "drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important. They will enable us to halve the deficit, which will be essential over the next four years", he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said that he was confident and that the growth of the economy would be restarted at the end of the year.
However, the forecast of Labour regarding economic growth - which influenced the amount it will need to borrow and the speed at which the deficit will be filled - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise its first digits.
In his speech, he said that the economy would decline probably 4.75% this year - worse that the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while the loan would be $ 3 billion higher than the prior estimate GDP.
'Missed opportunity' '.
The conservatives who will Thursday launch a new advertising campaign warning against the "debt crisis" plowing, stated that the project borrowing 789 billion GBP over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, have - they added, eluding "cynically" difficult choices until after the elections - which must be held by June 2010.
"They did nothing presented meaningful about what they were going to do", said Philip Hammond, the shadow Cabinet Treasury Chief Secretary. "They have had the opportunity to do so and they missed it."
"Important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner".
Roger Bootle, Deloitte.
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the Tory proposals that would result in a faster and larger deficit reduction.
But the Lib Dems have said that the money raised through the tax increase and the decrease in expenditures would be used to support expenditures for next year and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were "built on the wind".
Nick Robinson, the BBC political editor, said that the timing of announcements - such as the increase in inflation for some disability in April next, above-mentioned - benefits above â would leave the Chancellor facing accusations of propaganda, money is simply recovered the following year.
However, leLabour stressed that additional assistance is provided while people have the most need and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Fake budget".
Although Ministers have not released details of the expenses to the - beyond 2011, the economists argued that it was clear that the restrictions on public spending would begin to be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institute for fiscal studies) said that the figures of the Chancellor involve, in the future, substantial reductions in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defense.
"The pain is in fact only postponed," said its Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner", said Roger Bootle, economic adviser to Deloitte accountants.
"This has been a false report of pre - budget." The markets realize well".
The FBI investigates 'arrests of Americans in Pakistan'.
The FBI is investigating the arrest, Pakistan, five American reporters suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested during a raid in a house in Sarghoda in the Eastern province of Punjab, announced the American Embassy in Pakistan, the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether it was the same men who had been reported missing from their home in the U.S. State of Virginia, last month.
The American Foreign Affairs Ministry said that it was also seeking information about these people.
Three of them are presented as being of Pakistani ancestry, one of Egyptian heritage and one of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what are the charges against them and in what conditions they are held ", said leporte - Word, Ian Kelly."
Katherine Schweit, door - word of the FBI said that the Agency had been aware of the arrests and that she was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their activities there - down, and if they truly are students who are missing," she said.
Embassy of Pakistan, Washington said that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
Celle - ci said that the House was already monitored by local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the men arrested.
The Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton has refused any comment on the arrests, reported the Reuters news agency, but it said that States - United should "collaborate further with the Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train individuals".
The five students had been missing from their homes by their families, in Northern Virginia, late November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian 'abuses'.
These past 20 years, human rights were also little respected than ever, according to the report of the Amnesty International association.
The report presents "repetition of violations" by the regime, before and after the campaign for the presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report said that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said that he had been threatened with rape.
The Iran denied the previous criticism regarding its non respect of human rights.
The authorities stated that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands of people have been arrested and dozens killed in Iran, after the disputed President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election led to the largest public protests since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
Dozens have been sentenced to jail and prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, BBC Tehran correspondent now in London, says that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities not have tolerated any criticism, said our correspondent.
"False confession".
Amnesty International recounted the case of a student in computer science at 26 years, Jordan Martin, who said he was accused of ' working with networks of Facebook "and protesting against the results of the election.
"They often hit me in the face", he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under the eyes, on the neck, the head... They have threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and he was released and left in the street, still in blood and half conscious, said Amnesty.
In August, the candidate losing the election, Mehdi Karroubi, said that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others have been violated.
The Iranian authorities have denied the accusations of rape, but admitted that abuse had occurred.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said have been locked in a container with 75 other people, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre at Kahrizak.
Amnesty has accepted the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary to create a Committee to investigate disorders post - elections and the Government's response, but she said that the mandate and powers of these organisms were not clear and that the results of the Parliamentary Committee had not made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested to prevent other events over the past three weeks.
Ski slopes built in the City Park.
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to transform the site of Bristol into a track for competitions.
The Evenementpiste in the Park (a track in the Park) has attracted 16 skiers and snowboarders semi - professionals competing for a cash prize.
At the top of the track from Brandon Hill Park, a small springboard preceded a track of 100 m long.
John Hickman, student of fourth year of medicine, said that the view from the top of the track was magnificent but celle - ci was quite intimidating.
It is a beautiful with all the lights of the city glittering below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders of the country - of real talent ", he added.
Prizes were awarded best acrobatics - or figures on the track.

Islam can - it be french?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular State.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte.
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "why the French don't like headscarves" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on an issue that has divided and concerned the country for fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book presents a frame much broader and more ambitious.
Good anthropologist, it asked not only whether what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that provide now in France this queM. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for 5 m - 6 m Muslims.
He knows very well listen to and reproduce discussions between teachers and students on issues that concern them the most.
A Muslim should - he get married in a mosque or at the Town Hall (or both)?
The evolution and the rights of homosexuals should - they be taught to young Muslims?
A Muslim woman can - she marry a non - Muslim?
A Muslim can - it use interest-based banking system to get a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than political dramas that concern media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except may be Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't push the debate until the end.
Lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of a french or European islam.
Intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their lawyers of a purist Sunni islam associated with Saudi Arabia counterparts that nowadays constitute a small portion of Muslims in Europe.
M Bowen considers that the values of Muslims and the secular nature of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can be achieved only with the efforts of both sides.
He wondered how the french politicians (and the elite intellectual if virulent guardian of secularism) is actually committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims don't have not been spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants, and Jews who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a 'narrowness of the key values'.
Islam can - it be french? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "Yes, but not yet".
The darker view of the world.
Arctic changes faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
Ice which the compound is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that can survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing sail in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "on a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, writer and Illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the far North, the polar bear.
Connoisseur of history and complicated policies of the whale, it describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who were proven hunting polar bears.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then courageous aspiring 14-year-old who had to fight that the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young cubs, captured while they swam alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent in zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show brought together 75 bear at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still typically a millionth of the area required to an adult in freedom. the climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to algae that grew in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and is often on the threat posed by the fighters on the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada where the helicopter hunters and Indians Inuit in Enduro use of fusilsd' assault powerful to hunt their game.
Ironically, it was in waters the most northerly these two nations of hunting that ice will remain as long.
In his new book, "after the ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening Arctic Science summary and captivating insight into what will be may - be the future here - below.
Not that the scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmospheristes nor oceanographers can describe with accuracy the speed of change.
It is not lack of trying.
Late 19th and early 20th century, the pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen travel gave the first information about the melting of the ice cap.
-Submarines of the cold war were then mapped changes in terrain under - celle - ci.
Surveillance satellites and probes placed on icebergs are a great help, but the bulk of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the world extraordinary and tiny tributary system of the Arctic ice, formed by of brackish water pressed by freezing.
But mentioned bear above - on to the microscopic wonders contained in ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, planned from 2013 to 2050.
"In a few months, it will be may be our turn".
Marines, among the 6,000 people who have laid wreaths on the graves in Arlington.
The first class of ' Angello Robinson, 19, made a seven-hour journey by bus to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier whom he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who have travelled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, NC to cemetery Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was devoted to greet men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If this happened to me, I would like someone to do the same for me, this is why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers will be gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans, in different sections of the cemetery to Arlington Ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others have decided to decorate hundreds of graves in the cemetery in Arlington Ceremony.
Now, to continue a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen, make each year the trip, stopping in different cities on their way to organize commemorations in honor of the victims of terrorism and the military.
The Worcester have also founded an association non-profit, Wreaths Across America (wreaths across America), which aims to promote the event in all other States.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves of Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the Fayetteville National Cemetery enArkansas cemetery, in Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the memorial to the victims of Flight 93 to United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation gave more than $ 150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, age 70, of Westminster, said that she had made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a career soldier who died.
While her husband is not buried at Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way to thank those who were sacrificed.
It is a small gesture that can make the civilians to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between the lawns and extended hills cemetery.
Volunteers have chosen ancient tombs, dating from the first and the second world war, as well as the Viet Nam war, because those - ci are not also often visited as the new graves, said the organizers.
The mood was optimism, while the children played and couples stood by the hand, wearing the crowns of fresh pine on the gray graves.
Each round Crown had a dark green with a small red bow on top.
Nearby, hung the silence on the Section 60, where most veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals were crying without hiding, others prayed, and families and friends supported in the cold air.
Some read aloud names carved in stone while others swayed to see small information cards black and white, pressed into the wet earth for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in tears at the grave of his son.
It is part of Zanesfield, Ohio and drove eight hours to come to pray at the tomb of the Sergeant of Marine GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, died in combat in July.
Person should never forget thanks to what we are free... my son has paid for it, she said.
"Long after I have gone, I want that someone to remember him".
A U.S. citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities.
The Cuban Government has arrested an American national who was distributing cell phones and laptop computers in the country, said Ministry of American Foreign Affairs services.
National, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for such clients as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the inmate who was arrested on 5 December.
The precise charges have not been made public, although that under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested on the pretext of being 'dangerous'.
All so-called - revolutionary activities including moderate protests and critical writings, entail the risk of arrest.
Graffiti anti - Government and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a more and more bloggers community, led by Yoani SÃ¡nchez, popular commentator who writes often about how are husband and are followed and harassed by government agents.
SÃ¡nchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards, but permissions him have always been denied.
The detention of a US citizen will be increasing tensions between the Communist Government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has a "soft" approach to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times, Friday night.
New U.S. policy stresses that the Cuban Government advance by concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, so that the States - United can reciprocate.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although new and desired consumer goods in a country or the average salary of a civil servant is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban Government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texting or a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day of wages.
On the island, Internet use is extremely limited.
It is available in the hotels Luxury and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in certain government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often must communicate their names to the Government.
Access to many Web sites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the rare Americans incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, said Gloria Berbena, attached U press.Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said that she could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that in any other open society would be entitled - distribute free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director for the Americas of the Group Human Rights Watch, which recently issued a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba called "New Castro, same Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the leader of the country to replace Fidelhis ill older brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, past on trial and imprisoned the same day.
He said that any solution would be probably political and that the Cuban Government often provokes a negative reaction to the States - United, where the two countries begin to initiate a better dialogue.
The Pakistani authorities prevented a plot to send men in Afghanistan.
Saturday, the Pakistani authorities have identified an organization supposed to prepare a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia into Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying they hoped that this case would remove an important network of recruiters from terrorists who scour the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators have said that they hunted a personality insurgente hidden, known as Saifullah, who invited these men in Pakistan after having discovered them when one of them made comments approving terrorist waves on the YouTube Internet video site.
Arrived in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah, who tried to help them to reach the remote region of the tribal belt of Pakistan, home to al - Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Pakistani secret services who was briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to persuade the commanders of al - Qaida that these men were not involved in CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Thus, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of North - has become a haven of terrorism.
They were considered as undercover agents.
This is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities said that the men were committed and that they were still trying to obtain the necessary permissions to obtain entry into the camps of al - Qaida when they were arrested by Pakistani law.
The case of the five men--who remain in Pakistan and who are interviewed by the FBI--emphasize the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and may be more important in the determination of the people in that place its trust.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. secret service had priority to infiltrate men in the al - Qaida network.
The Organization recruiters play the role of guards - barriers, refusing entry to those who don't show a serious commitment and those that may be being spies.
Analysts said potential U.S. recruits are studied closely by al - Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential to U.S. targets access and their propagandaire value.
But Evan Kohlmann, expert of the NEFA Foundation based in the States - United, said that terrorist groups must also be more attention, in recent years in the choice of the persons that they accept as the U.S. secret service have become experts in relation to their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many people have already attended? said Kohlmann.
The model is one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protestants in Copenhagen call "action" for the climate.
Tens of thousands of protestants marched in the streets, here Saturday, calling for greater action on climate on the part of the negotiators in the Bella Convention Center, the city Congress.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists has lit a few explosives near a set of government buildings in downtown.
On this day where little happened during discussions on climate sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists marched around the city, deploying placards in English saying ' there is no planet B "and one in Spanish, stating"The Earth says that it has enough".
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including top model and Danish photographer, Helena Christensen, who said that travel to the homeland of his mother, the Peru, opened his eyes on the heartbreaking problems that faced the country due to the impact of climate change already occurring "."
It is one of the reasons why I decided to join the large market - to spread the word and appeal to the world leaders for making decisions fair, ambitious and committed, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella centre and said that they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they wore a mask or that they were in possession of Pocket knives.

According to a passerby who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in discussions on climate, activists who were wearing masks and black clothes, lit several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is surrounded by a few departments.
They threw them near buildings, he said, adding that those - were first rockets, followed then by "a few big explosions".
The Interior of the Palais des CongrÃ¨s, the people gathered around television screens to follow the market, during the course of the after - noon.
But it seems that the protesters have failed to awaken the conscience of authorities key such as Su Wei, representing China for the climate.
When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on the international deliberations, he replied in English, "in fact, it is something which I had no conscience.
It then continued in Mandarin, declaring "the event being important, I can't hear what is happening outside".
He noted that the market could seem harmful or helpful depending on the perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or that they impair the freedom of others".
The results of the tests reveal persistent gaps between the races.
The federal report last week on the results in mathematics has brought good news for the public schools of Washington, D.C..
Although the District is still far behind settlements of head, the report shows that the Grade 4 and Grade 5 (grades 4 - 5) are in much greater progress during the previous two years in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But by the last digits of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (national assessment of education progress) is the persistent gap between the results of the afro - American and white, on both local and national.
The average results of white children in Grade 4 (4) in WashingtonD.C. increased during these last two years, from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their classmates Afro - American increased by three points, 209-212.
The achievement gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the Afro - American in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling only by one point, from 245 to 244.
The average score for white was not included in the results of the tests because the sample was not large enough.
Overview over a period of six years is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 class (cm1), when the first NAEP of District report was published, was 60 points (262-202).
Although the results obtained by the children in both groups increased during this period, the difference is only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District have expressed concern that rising celebrated by the Director of Group of Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (d) schools were propelled by the White students who were already good elements.
It would mean that we raised the aggregate taking into account the elements at the top of the scale, what is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a group nonprofit that defends equality in education in the District.
I do not jump out of joy for one or two points earned, said Kwame R. Brown (related Democrat), Member of the Board of D.C. and whose daughter is in Grade 4 at Eaton Elementary (elementary school).
Often critical of management style of Rhee, Brown said that the message of the test results is that middle schools (colleges) of the city desperately needs attention.
Really, you always want to see positive signs and I respect him.
But what makes fear is that we allocate enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, schoolchildren of the end of elementary classes and beginning of college that have not have integrated the basics of reading earlier in their careers school and who are quite late compared to their peers.
Every day, the programme of mathematics, (6th) (kindergarten) to Grade 6 Kindergarten classes focuses on games and experiences of real life, as they have been implemented in the District by the former head of Clifford Janey, which must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think that we need to continue to work to provide best interventions to these students of lower level than that of the class, '' said Rhee.
Others believe that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the General results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less good results in order to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an instructor of education at the University of Berkeley in California who studies the results of tests of the cities.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and your management reforms to schools in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Also this targeting can have political implications that interfere with this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that as the other schools Superintendent, she tries to use middle-class whites and blacks.
Our focus is to ensure the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhoods schools so that all families, regardless of where they originate, are assured that their children will get an excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week, one of the essential elements for the gap's success was the duration of traditional public school, today of 180 days in the District of Washington, to be in competition with Charter schools.
Should get about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with its teachers Union year last for 185 days, which it considers a "starting point" to get an increase again in the next contract.
Make higher education a promise for the future.
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years, descending and blinks a moment of the eyes at the sight of white columns, brick facades and lush green lawns.
The parents of Graciela had only able to finish high school, Ael El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela it - even, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, had never set foot on a University campus.
Also, while she and other students of Grade 8 (4th) of the Group explored Gettysburg, where tuition fees are $38 690 per year, his attitude was less that of a new and enthusiastic impressed student.
Super this is where I study! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, while the guide heading them toward the entrance of the science building.
Yay, really? said - it pensive, when it indicated the low Professor of law - student ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that visited the children during their journey of discovery of three days and now, they had completely integrated the message: the question is not if you go to the University.
The question is where.
Although that this question is still largely for the large number of American children born of immigrant Hispanic parents who have left high school where became parents in adolescence, they are also the hundreds of thousands to benefit from University education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a Hispanic from the" second generation "on cinqpoursuit his studies at high school - a success notable considering that both of their immigrant parents, most of the Mexico or Central America, came to the States - United without having completed high school."
Their success is important, say the researchers, they pave the way to future generations who will play an important role in the workforce of the country.
Researchers studying the Leafs say that those - have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high targets to their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach the University - in particular, if its efforts are regular and long term.
When you look at the children of families with low income parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any operation, at any time, do not help them, said Patricia GÃ¡ndara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who has studied Latin - American students.
We need to think to offer a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded Graciela universities visit is a good example.
Known as the GEAR UP (prepare yourself), it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize the University preparation programs that begin when families of low income students are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of the years of high school.
Since 1999, the program was followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the University, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The Iraqi oil Ministry gets agreements with 10 foreign oil companies.
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Government of Iraq has managed to attract oil companies important to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auctions that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements obtained by the Department from Iraqi oil with foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of the oil industry of Iraq, struck down by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies are left with a stake in only two of the 10 fields up for auction.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began Friday.
The only one that had put a bid lost.
Two U.S. companies were awarded contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of the American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
The Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of US companies, are of Asian and European companies which pave the way, said Ruba husari at, editor of the Iraq Oil forum, a site of information on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer being made in Iraq.
Concerns about security, supported by coordinated bombing, Tuesday, and political instability as American troops withdraw slowed U.S. oil companies, preventing them to enter with greater force in Iraq that has the third largest reserve of oil gross worldwide, analysts say.
Companies American were, in some cases, disadvantaged due to their rivals, particularly the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a Government, whose labor costs were significantly lower and were more ready to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon - Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The largest U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong links with the Iraqi oil Ministry and brought him technical advice, left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this week - end.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the State, has more bid on contracts that other companies and is distributed with significant interests in contracts for two major fields.
We know that China is becoming an economy major, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, door - Ministry of oil spokesman.
We are confident that Chinese society will be on par with its competitors and will carry out its commitments in Iraq.
Companies pre - selected to submit bids made offers that were then compared to the tariff per barrel that the Department had agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al - Qaida was killed in Pakistan.
It seems that a U.S. missile hit along the border with the Afghanistan has killed one of the organizers of the operations of al - Qaida, this week, said U.S. authorities Friday of counter - espionage.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack against one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al - Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of having been killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to sources U.S. and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities said that the missiles had been fired by a drone of the type used by the CIA inside the lawless tribal border of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, toward the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of the Pakistani civilian secret services, speaking on the phone from Miran Shah.
Representatives of the Authority reported that suspected local militants rushed on the spot and quickly confiscated what remained "totally shredded bodies".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to check the identity of the victims, but the two anti - terrorist American representatives gave unspecified evidence that Somali was part of the dead.
Somali was described as being one of organizing military officials of al - Qaida who ran terrorist operations of the group outside the Afghanistan - Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of the strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this likely included conspiracies to attack the - United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic instructions of the leaders of al - Qaida and has translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the American Authority said that Somali had progressed rapidly in the ranks of al - Qaida's and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the American public, but this did not decrease in the threat to us and our allies, '' said the second official.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second important Al - Qaida figure, or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks carried out by CIA drones has declined since the summer, about six operations per month to two, according to the figures by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a not-for-profit group.
This decline is can - be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups who have progressed to decrease their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, says the site.
The special envoy of the United Nations in Kabul withdrew.
The special envoy of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous term tainted by allegations of corruption spread during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
The departure of Eide comes as the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan.
The UN Envoy said that he supported the increase but it has expressed its concern regarding the schedule for the States - United for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and that would oblige Governments of NATO to withdraw their forces.
We must accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the - United States and other military powers to increase the number of international staff helping the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase should be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said that he was not resigning but that he would simply commitment he had towards his family, in March, to only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki - moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I just said that it is better to start looking for my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to the representatives of the United Nations, Ban has already begun looking for a replacement.
Officials say that the name of Staffan di Mistura was quoted; It's an citizen Italo - Switzerland who recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean - Marie GuÃ©henno, a French who previously headed the UN peacekeeping operations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan was put to the test after that Peter W. Galbraith, his former Deputy, had accused him, in September, to encourage President Hamid Karzai in the presidential elections and to conceal evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has denied the allegations, but he said that accusations of Galbraith - who thanked - "have harmed the mission because there was already a healthy dose of scepticism with regard to the international observation of the elections".
Eide said that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the rescue of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN officials so that they allow his successor to hire more staff from the - United States and other Western countries that it is not assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that it would give them more confidence on how their money is spent.
EIDE expressed his frustration regarding the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that heavy hiring UN regulations hindered its ability to bring new talent.
The UN standard rules are such that I could not recruit a single person since may, he said.
This is catastrophic and it cannot last.
Gates: The Iran must undergo additional sanctions.
The Secretary of Defense, Robert M. Gates said Friday that the major world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its failure to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking before an audience of 300 American soldiers North of Iraq, on a one week visit in areas of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, undramatised the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a question from a soldier about the possibility of such an outcome. Â¨.
One of the things that weighs me the most, is that if I have learned one thing in Iraq during the past six years, it is the unpredictable side inherent in war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions aimed the military elite and the Iran policy, but Gates noted that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians from the street.
He said that a "set of motivations and punishments" may be necessary to persuade the Iranian Government that it would be actually less good security with nuclear weapons "because" his people suffer enormously ' of these sanctions.
Friday, in a statement of the spokesperson - the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration has joined European leaders in a warning that the Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not reduce its nuclear programme in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its monitoring body, the International Agency for Atomic Energy (IAEA).
The Iran continues to say he wants to develop its nuclear experience only for peaceful purposes.
In the Geneva talks, October 1, he said that it would resume dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme and agreed to give up a significant part of its storage of enriched uranium in Exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed such an agreement, average to develop confidence on both sides and save time for negotiations.
Since then, the Iran appears to be distant attempts of agreement - in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on the fact whether or not to engage with States - United.
Frankly, in my opinion, the stiffening of the Iran against some of the proposals of the international community for which they had in fact given their agreement at the beginning of October, has pushed the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join what they did had not considered, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama has set December 31 as deadline to the Iran to respond to the proposals, before he turned to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called 'increased sanctions'.
In a statement made Thursday in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations denounced what it called "baseless allegations" of some members of the Security Council on the Iran nuclear activities and said it was agreed to continue the talks with the - United States and five other world powers, "in order to obtain a satisfactory solution in the long term".
Gates, who was to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, the Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri al - Maliki, before flying to the rich oil region of Kurdish to find the leaders of troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly regarding borders, property rights and revenue sharing.
Gates urged the two parties to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays US plans to reduce the number of American troops, from 115 000 to 50 000 by the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the anxiety of the Kurds on the withdrawal pending. The US authorities have cited Gates telling Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan regional government: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq".
We will not abandon you "."
In aging China, a change of direction.
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by displays of propaganda sermonnant them, "Mother earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "one more baby, is a grave and more".
They have learned the lesson that the authorities of the Shanghai Government, alarmed by the low birth rate of their city and by the aging of the population have radically changed direction so well this summer and have begun to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instant and closed: never.
We have already given all our time and all our energy to a single child.
We have no second, said Wang, 31 years, Director of human resources and has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the policy of one-child in China, creating two generations of children known to be unique with good cheeks and spoiled, nicknamed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared with six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents 60 years and more will explode, 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. This figure is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in the rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 percent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission) said that fertile couples were having babies so "to help reduce the proportion of the aging population and to prevent a lack of manpower in the future".
Shanghai is poised to become "as old - but not as rich, however - that developed countries such as the Japan and the Sweden" she said.
A fading.
Written in the constitution of the country in 1978, China of one-child policy is to date, without a doubt, the most controversial requirement introduced by the Communist Government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay huge fines - up to three times their annual income - to experience discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have attributed to the police duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights advocates have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced pregnant women to a second child to have abortions.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to a ratio boys - girls abnormally high.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they gave more exceptions to the rule - including for the residents of the cities, members of ethnic minorities and the cases in which the man and the woman are already unique children - and in 2007, they have softened many of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, Professor at the Institute of Population Research (Institute of population research) at Peking University, said that the central government authorities recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allow couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters urging families to have that one child have been replaced by copies of regulations detailing who has the right to have a second child and how the authorization request.
The city government dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet with couples at their home and slip leaflets under their door.
He has also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response has been disappointing.
Disappointing response.
Although officials in a rural town in the suburbs of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples wishing to a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
Huinan commune, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still four to five requests per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010, is always planned be only about 165,000 - slightly higher in 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Committee of family planning in the municipality of Shanghai Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason for which many people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, have said they would love having two children and that they are legally permitted.
But like many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and life given by the Government.
Without social protection, say - they, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners believe wrongly that the one-child policy is a rights issue, said Yang, an engineer in construction whose wife is pregnant with seven months of the first child of the couple.
It is true, is stolen we fortunate to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
It is the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, head of human resources, said that she did only a single child because she was a she - even. "We were the center of the family and had used that everyone takes care of us."
We do not have the habit of taking care of someone else and we really do not wish to take care of others "."
Chen Zijian, 42 years and owner of a translation company puts it more bluntly.
Working on two couples, middle class, that lower the rate of birth, says - it, to be selfish to succeed.
People from 20 or 30 years have grown up seeing their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and don't want to have them - same this style of life, says - it.
Even a single child requires a lot of time to his parents, says - it.
A mother must leave at least two years of his social life.
Then there are problems of space - "You need to change your apartment" - and planning - "When your child is only 9 months old, you must write his CV to get a place in the best kindergarten".
Most of his friends are ready to this experience once, said Chen, but not both.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a standard of living higher, said - it.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group draft plans for the reduction of emissions.
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations - characterized so far by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations - came under the spotlight Friday, due to the publication of a document highlighting the ambitious reductions gas greenhouse over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations supporting most of the load, in the next time.
The text that might provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, said remaining obstacles, as much as it has lit the path to take.
But he was seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that lack of time, with more than 100 leaders from around the world arriving the week next to Copenhagen.
Written by a special UN working group, the text does not say how rich countries give to the poor to withstand global warming, courses and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for the critical issues, including the way to developed economies and the new emerging economies could reduce their production of carbon and what would be the upper limit of the increase in global temperature that policymakers would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, '' said John Coequyt, representative in Washington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what has described the Executive Secretary-General on climate change of the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, as being "the full picture".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would reduce collectively their emissions by 2020, from 25 to 45 percent compared with 1990 levels, so that major countries developing, over the same period, would reduce theirs by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 per cent for 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched negotiations, Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion per year for the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change - to withstand floods and drought to avoiding deforestation.
However, Friday, the same verbal altercations have occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, representative of States - us climate negotiation rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of gases greenhouse by the industrialized countries, compared to the voluntary efforts made by major economies emerging, if those - ci were not financed by developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration gets tougher toward China that the Bush administration was, two years ago.
States - United will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of the main developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not insist enough to ensure that reductions could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the vice - Chinese Foreign Minister He Yafei has said that the American negotiator, lacked "common sense" or was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that States - United would not financially help China to fight against global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the main world powers at stake, defects have appeared both within the third - world and between the industrial world and the emerging economies.
The current battle is more the rescue of individual economies as the rescue of the planet, with China and the States - United bickering on their respective obligations while poorer nations insist on the fact that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more boldly.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting for who should suffer the costs of greenhouse gas reduction, even if vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make large emitters accountable for their actions.
It really is a game in which developed a new economic hegemony, said Ulate, who is also Adviser on climate for the Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to put pressure to get a binding treaty legally, in Copenhagen, although most participants say the negotiations will at least lead to a political agreement.
The Alliance of small island States which brings together 43 members, wrote a proposal for a 24-page treatise, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge - Metzger, head of the climate of the European Commission, said that the action of small island States has "put a political pressure on the entire political process", in part by what they are now unified and they demand in emerging economies such as the China and India to act.
The debates have become a matter of urgency, while delegates focused on the fact that they had resolved most of the problems pending before government leaders reach an agreement.
The high-level officials such as Minister of the Indian environment, Jairam Ramesh and Vice - Minister of China are descended from their plane and rushed into the building of the Bella Center to attend in - camera meetings and conferences of information, in order to make claims to be studied over the next week.
The true image of the gathering - in which 13,000 people entering and leaving the Palace of Congress each day - guitar players activists have nightly shows mocking the countries that they will betray and that proposals are drafted and distributed on paper rather than by email - is a real challenge.
The intensity is growing: almost all of the important ministers are here and Wednesday not later, 60 heads of Governments will be in Copenhagen.
We enter the big leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of Conservation International.
Heavy goods vehicles arrive.
In Great - Britain, the first train to 225 km / h will redefine Monday syndrome.
5 h 13, Monday morning, a whistle blow will protrude through the night to signal the departure of a train which will mark a revolution in transport in Great - Britain.
The first train at high speed in the country will reach 225 km / h, while it filera Ashford, in Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first train Javelin outside London.
He hopes that the new service will allow the Great - Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and link the great conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland in London.
Lost holes will become the flourishing cities, business travel times will be less long and the passage of the aircraft and the car to the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties acceding to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental hazards may curb the British lines at high speed.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to carry out a feasibility report for the Government, will make his paper to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will allow him to get a detailed map of the route of the next step planned for high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment could be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters of the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 has three options for a network high-speed bigger, going northward.
Lord Adonis will meet the spring.
The preferred options are put forward in a configuration in Y for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will be split into two in or near Birmingham, with one branch going towards the West of the Pennines Manchester and Scotland and one other from North - East to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line through Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best option for performance ' said a rail professional."
When this is done, the time of travel between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a trip of an hour currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel 400 km / h, making it the world's fastest UK network.
The original route is designed to allow trains of 400 m in length and capable of carrying 1,100 people.
Up to 18 trains an hour can run on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal accommodating 20000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the constraints of space, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high speed network.
The rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International and Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce if he thinks whether the project should be put in place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network should be built part-by-part.
Trains will first have to roll off the lines at high speeds on existing track North of Birmingham, retaining journey times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to ensure a passage from planes to trains, constituting a point of reference for the revolution of the rail.

I demanded the abandonment of loads here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the behavior of the judge in the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back".
According to him, the judge Rittenband - died since - would have discussed, before making its award, with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserves prison - what constitutes a serious fault of procedure.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), from the same mouth of the Attorney in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally said late September he "lied" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the Court would refuse to abandon the prosecution, Mr. Hummel claimed a trial, which would allow him to present evidence of his arguments.
The prosecution has reiterated the arguments already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment of the charges could not be seriously studied as long as Roman Polanski would not submit to the Court.
The filmmaker, aged 76 years, had fled States - United in 1978, before his sentencing, for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
It was never delivered to States feet - United since.
The Deputy Prosecutor of the County of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski "must be there for the hearing".

One of the three judges - who have now 90 days to make their decision - he also stressed "that there were other alternatives to escape".
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to apply for abandonment of prosecutions against Roman Polanski.
Counsel for Samantha Geimer, the victim, she also claimed, once more, the end of the prosecution.
Recalling that his client no longer supports to be harassed at every twist of the Polanski case, she added: "nobody in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough '. "

Johnny Hallyday news "are very positive," assured Friday his son David upon his arrival at Los Angeles airport where it was to go to the bedside of his father hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It is very strong, it's going very well, said to the press David Hallyday on his release from the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 1 pm local (21 H 00 GMT).
The son of singer, relaxed air, assured that he would get "very quickly" to hospital Cedars - Sinai in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection resulting from a herniated disc operation on 26 November in Paris.
The singer was "placed in artificial coma that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent it from suffering and be able to administer his treatment", said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in artificial coma by doctors of the hospital Cedars - Sinai in Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday for an infection resulting from a herniated disc operation on 26 November in Paris.
The singer had to be rÃ©opÃ©rÃ© in the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to lesions resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning at the french LycÃ©e of Los Angeles where is enrolled their daughter Jade, to attend a school talent show, found a photographer from AFP.
The Chief of surgery orthopaedic and trauma of the Hospital of la PitiÃ© - SalpÃªtriÃ¨re, Yves CatonÃ©, announced that he would Monday in Los Angeles with the singer.
The producer has violently questioned Dr StÃ©phane Delajoux, neurosurgeon who operated the singer on 26 November at the international clinic of the parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, said Mr. Camus.
I've heard of a possible future judicial proceedings, he said.
Jean - Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday had "left much too fast for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Paris surgeon".
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and this had stunned me, because I had me - even two Herniated discs, he added.
Previously on RTL, it stated that the singer was apparently "gone without drain, with nothing', after its Paris operation.
Dr StÃ©phane Delajoux is well-known in the artistic community.
It had operated actress Marie Trintignant Vilnius, a few days before his death, at a clinic in Neuilly - sur - Seine where he practiced at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reduce hematoma following a brain haemorrhage.
But it is also a sulphurous reputation doctor, repeatedly condemned by the justice, in folders in medical liability, as well as for tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, counsel for the College of physicians, accused him of being 'a man without scruples' pursued 'regular' before the Council of the order, and which is "far from recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr StÃ©phane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
-Ci stated that the intervention was "perfectly well conducted" and post - operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not haemorrhagic and therefore did not require the installation of a drain," he added.
In any event, the tour of the singer, whose health problems multiply since this summer, appears in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (Amiens, Editor's note) as expected, it appears to be very short, said Mr. Camus.
The UDF association increase the tone and sum new Centre no longer use its initials.
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem of FranÃ§ois Bayrou, reacted Friday to attempting to takeover of the Chairman of the new Centre, HervÃ© Morin, on the acronym of the ex - party giscardien, turning House should not be used on any medium, under penalty of prosecution.
HervÃ© Morin has publicly announced its intention to reclaim the acronym UDF, judging that FranÃ§ois Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after having extended a hand to the left.
The Minister of defence, which the party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy Saturday before the national Council of the NC.
In support of his approach, he received the support of the Member HervÃ© de Charette (ex - UMP to NC) who claim ownership of the UDF mark for being the first to file in 2004 at the national Institute of industrial property.
But Friday evening, office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of FranÃ§ois Bayrou who do not intend to let dispossess, emerged from his silence to launch a last notice to the Minister and member of Parliament, demanding them to no longer use the acronym and convey the ownership of the mark, under penalty of prosecution.
You have multiplied, these days, statements indicating that you were going to propose to your political movement of + resume + the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including FranÃ§ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis centrist Alliance.
You also believed good to follow on your activist material and on the page of your site, the name of this movement, the + new + slogan + UDF of today +, also find the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you did did no right to the use of this acronym, says the office of UDF which remains the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any medium as well as (his) website".
It also asks HervÃ© de Charette "to convey the property of (the) brand to its legitimate right holders".
If you did not, the courts would take to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, warn the signatories.
In their letter, they stipulate that the UDF "is a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave in 2007 "to create a rival movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The new centre has therefore, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French democracy).
They also recall that the last Congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of training founded by ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for HervÃ© de Charette, pursuing office, "when he registered the trademark", it was "more Member of the UDF for three years", but the UMP.
He took advantage criminally and fraudulently the abscence of deposit of the acronym UDF to do it on his behalf.
This indiscretion is turning into crime, denounce - they before ridicules the NC strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more dignified to make a name by itself - even than trying out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which it is not entitled".
Case Liliane Bettencourt: FranÃ§ois - Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness.
The Nanterre tribunal decided Friday to judge the artist FranÃ§ois - Marie Banier to determine, though, accused as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he took advantage of a weak condition of the octogenarian to the plunder of a portion of his fortune.
62 years old photographer known for his photographs of stars, will be held on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of three years in prison and 375,000 euro fine.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga about a family the richest in France, in which mother and daughter tear about taking the reins of the L'oreal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th Criminal Chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, aged of 87 years, should be conducted jointly by three doctors.
The heiress and main shareholder of l ' OrÃ©al has always refused to submit to such a review, at least not under the conditions proposed by the public prosecutor of Nanterre in the investigation.
Doctors nominated Friday must submit a report before March 10, 2010 by saying especially if Liliane Bettencourt was able to be in a State of weakness and at what times.
I think is submit.
I'll talk to him, said out of the hearing counsel for Mrs Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman.
For his part, counsel for FranÃ§oise Bettencourt - Meyers, Mr. Olivier Metzner, welcomed the tribunal's decision.
This is excellent news (...) Expertise will demonstrate that he (Mr. Banier) has manipulated this elderly lady that must protect, he said.
Two years ago, the daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has prosecuted criminal against FranÃ§ois - Marie Banier, photographer and artist touches - to - all, she accuses of having profited for years from the weakness of his mother to get one billion euros of donations, in the form of cheques, insurance - life or paintings.
For his part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, as a longtime friend.
While the tribunal had to consider the admissibility of the action brought by Ms. Bettencourt - Meyers, the arguments of counsel sometimes turned to large family unpacking Friday.
Thus, counsel for Liliane Bettencourt reported three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary, in which she said beware of the husband of FranÃ§oise Bettencourt - Meyers.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: 'could - explain you to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for 15 years.
FranÃ§oise, I could never talk to her since her marriage '. "
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor again found that the complainant was not entitled to act, as a guardianship judge declined these days to accede to its request to open proceedings for judicial protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to sue, she is not under protection and has no guardian."
No one else has to act in its place ", said the representative of the public prosecutor, Marie - Gavin DANLOG."
Finally, the tribunal decided that it would decide when the trial will be held on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt - Meyers.
Revolution managerial or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of the large companies to its employees, recalls the position of the undertakings on consumers before the marketing revolution: it comes to join the employees 'values' defined at the top as it once was to impose on consumers of the products designed by the technicians of the factory.
Putting the customer at the heart of the business, the marketing revolution gave markets strategies place... While the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from the factors of preferences of clients regularly!
A demobilization of employees can lead to a deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are the Party emerged a much broader phenomenon which affects in particular frameworks.
This demobilization seriously hinders the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including the R & D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, IE "requires all stakeholders (...) a proactive and forward-looking"; It requires on the part of employees commitment that authoritarian management revenues run totally counter.
This is why we call for a managerial revolution that would put employees at the centre of the concerns of the business in the same way as the client.
Utility internal relative of opinion polls.
The questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees - internal - as opinion polls go - they encourage this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I fear not.
-Firstly because I could see that, facing a situation new, any structure is finally, after many detours, to priority... what she has always done. !
-Then, because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - grows proportionally to the importance of his own failures.
-Finally, because most of the leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
From the large schools of engineers, they have a mechanistic understanding of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old theory behaviorist, recently revived by the "neuroscience" States - companies and widely disseminated, unbeknownst to them, by the institutes d ' studies and media. "
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "levers" (sic) of the engagement of the Executive, a recent Ipsos survey published in Le Figaro.fr it strengthens leaders in a posture of mechanistic, inadequate governance at the world today.
Identify and measure the factors of mobilization.
Instead, the managerial revolution necessary to the functioning of modern companies, involves a finalist vision of human behavior.
It is to integrate into any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is possible only if celle - ci clearly appears as a means to achieving some of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only from studies of the motifonctionnelle analysis adopt this conception of the motivations of employees.
These studies have shown that they consider their business based on a predetermined doxa which allows them, through their image of the company, d "assess what she offers them to achieve their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these factors of mobilization, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and hand over their management of human resources "to place".
They thus create favourable ground to the concerted development of a robust and effective economic intelligence.
Speech in Oslo: the 'just war' is worth praise right at Obama.
The right American welcomed Friday the speech delivered the day before in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the Nobel Prize for peace 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against enemies of the States - United.
The Conservatives, who had ideas the awarding of the prize to Mr. Obama on 9 October, applauded this time presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former candidate to the vice - presidency in the elections of 2008.
I liked what he said, said Ms. Palin, face of the right wing of the Republican party in the USA Today daily, adding it - even addressing the theme of "sometimes necessary" war memoirs which have just been published.
The war is of course the last thing in my opinion that the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop these terrorists all there - down, she said.
Mr. Obama, who inherited two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and in Afghanistan, worked Thursday to Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, said that the president had made in Oslo "very good job".
I found that the speech was really great, welcomed the former president of the House of representatives, which has particularly appreciated the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential remarks.
Some side, I found this speech - at - historical fact, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
Former elected, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election of 2012, said he was delighted to have seen "a left president" reminded the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not free and could deliver a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former pen of George W. Bush and columnist for the Washington Post, Mr. Obama gave "a very American speech".
In addition to appear in "citizen of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke as an American president", recalling the Europeans "that they live in a bubble of security they have not created and that they are not big thing to preserve", said Mr. Gerson.
Among the rare right to be unconvinced, a Hawk of the era Bush, former Ambassador to the UN John Bolton, described "dull, bombastic" and uninspired speech on National Review Online.
The president left, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is alarmed to see Barack Obama justified the use of force.
When it wraps the war in the concept of justice, one can easily justify the massacre of innocent people, he warned.
Press centre - left remained, however, praise to the place of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, has qualified his remarks of "blockbuster" even for an orator known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", ignited by the Daily Californian.
Mr. Obama "gave the speech he needed", said the New York Times, deeming it "both dark and uplifting".

But we can always have a few holdouts who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, Chairman of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement", even though it was "difficult to grant increases on the high salaries in light of the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be the order of 170 euros monthly for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.

The opposition of employers ' organisations can only delay the process.
FNTR denounced a "market's bargain", as EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to offset a portion of the carbon tax".
The Secretary? State for transport forced us to negotiate in l? emergency, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but to not annoy the next Eve Turkey eaters, regretted the Unostra.
For the ur agreement may "dig the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this week - end, disgruntled unions of the RATP proposals.
Disturbances on the RER A, the largest line of urban transit of France, will continue during the week - end, while a meeting Friday on the second day of strike between unions and management of the RATP has left them hungry as their claim to premium.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important week - end of shopping before Christmas, there is trains between 10 H 00 and 20 H 00, at the rate of a train on two on the central section (between defence and Nation) and one train in four outside the central section.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended from Nanterre Prefecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette, waiting for 200,000 customers every day, rejoiced that "Efforts to make the RATP to serve department stores".
RER line A crosses from West to East the Paris metropolitan area.
The segment RATP short of Saint - Germain - en - Laye and Nanterre to Boissy - Saint - LÃ©ger and Marne - La - VallÃ©e.
Friday, about a train on two taxied at peak hours, and almost any train in off-peak hours, as expected.
As Thursday, was not there rushes on the docks, Franciliens is being organized.
So in the morning, the station of Saint - Germain - en - Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than to ordinary, notably because of the absence of junior high school and high school students.
At Boissy - Saint - LÃ©ger (Val - de - Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29-year-old engineer, explained to be lifted "a thirty hour earlier, so be sure to arrive on time".
Gare Saint - Lazare has not been overrun, said SNCF, who had planned a mentoring agents and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by train coming from or towards Cergy - the - top arrived or departed from gare Saint - Lazare to subways.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, judged "lean" by unions, of a meeting with management Friday after - noon.
The Director of RSP offers to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER A on all aspects, working time, career etc.
This is not what want drivers, who are demanding a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP puts even his proposals of premium brackets, will is outraged the CGT, stressing that the direction "was not damn problem while in the road and train it's done".
A new meeting is scheduled Monday for "a broader review of the conditions of exercise of the profession", said the RATP.
What did also say the unions that the company "made fun of users of week - end".
In the morning, about 150 drivers had invaded a Committee at Headquarters in Paris.
This is while the leadership, who refused until then any discussion during the strike, had suggested the meeting "for the sake of appeasement".
The conflict threatens to expand to the RER B Tuesday, after the filing of a notice by Unsa and independent.
Unions demand a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros including variable EUR 30 (CGT, FO, CFDT, southern, independent) and complain about the deterioration of the working conditions on this line to the million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second half of career, affect 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross so that 600 to 650 euros in bonuses, for schedules shifted, on Sundays and public holidays.
The Turkish Court dissolves the pro - Kurdish party, decision with serious consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court gave Friday the dissolution of the main party pro - Kurdish of the country, a decision that was immediately followed by expressions of anger in the Kurdish community in the South - East of the country and Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the Government, that comes from reaching out to the Kurdish community in an attempt to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The party for a democratic society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "home of activities prejudicial to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", said to the press the president of the Court Hasim Kilic, at the end of four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, said Mr. KiliÃ§, adding that 37 of the cadres of the party, including its president Ahmet TÃ¼rk and the MP Aysel Tugluk, were banned from politics for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. TÃ¼rk and Ms. Tugluk and confiscation by the Treasury of the assets of the party.
The DTP has 21 seats in the Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MEPs would leave the Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without a label.
The decision follows a procedure initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of cassation Abdurrahman YalÃ§Ä±nkaya, who accused the DTP to obey the 'guidelines' of the workers party of Kurdistan (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party ensures however that it has "no organic links" with the PKK but refuses to qualify that - ci of terrorist organization and calls on the Government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the Court comes as the Government has to reach out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to try to dry up the support of the Kurds of the PKK and end the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP had said that a dissolution could lead to an upsurge in tensions in South - East Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the leader of the PKK Abdullah Ãcalan have degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
As soon as justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered outside the premises of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the great city of South - East inhabited predominantly by Kurds.
Security forces fired tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw molotov cocktails and stones, with fronds.
A hundred people demonstrated also in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. TÃ¼rk stated that the decision of Justice was "deepening despair".
The Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, Editor's note) by banning a party, he told the press.
The Government, formed by a party of the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of parties.
This only solves nothing, said Minister of energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total sinking of democratic openness initiated by the Government, said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
Of course, to expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the North of the Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow may fall.
What wishes Wolfgang Brauburger, it is a good harsh winter.
But the head of the service of clearing and sanding of roads (FES) makes it clear that this is not to annoy the citizens.
It is simply so that agents can test the technique of vehicles and learn to control them well.
And according the meterologues, this could well be for this weekend.
More than 300 officers and 120 vehicles stand ready to tackle the snow and sleet.
The FES here follows a very elaborate plan.
Mr Brauburger says that as soon as he begins to snow on the city of Frankfurt and the temperatures drop below zero, large vehicles of sandblasting roam 20 main routes (referred to as routes A).
This includes the streets in heavy traffic, the main arteries, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer LandstraÃe.
Also included are firefighters access, transit routes, pedestrian areas and streets sloping as the Atzelbergstrasse.
The FES agents begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometers of highways must be dirty with a road de-icer adhering well, 3 hours maximum.
This is the reason for which service of the FES starts at 3 o'clock in the morning "so that the roads are cleared when start commuting traffic".
Where it gets more difficult, when the snow begins to fall a7h30 in the morning.
This causes problems, says the head of the service of clearing and sanding of roads "because no motorist is willing to pass up salting vehicles."
Then, if it snows more, we take care of roads and access roads serving - as the Rat - Beil - StraÃe.
The secondary roads and side streets come last.
Mr. Brauburger knows that this causes always a few complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, walking the FES team starts to clear priority areas deemed dangerous and passages.
About bike paths, the FES services generally cannot deal.
Mr. Brauburger said that there in Frankfurt a special service which is responsible for monitoring the State of bridges between 10 p.m. and 4:30.
As the ice quickly forms on these surfaces, salting vehicles occur as soon as the temperature drops 2 degrees below.
It also happens that the police avail this service special incase of need.
The cradle of the dinosaurs.
Tawa hallae resembled other carnivorous dinosaurs: this bipedal measured about 2 meters long and 1.50 m high, its hind limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was equipped with teeth sharp and curved, its short arms ended with sickle claws and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would them have nothing exceptional.
But, as reported by Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and his colleagues in the journal Science on Thursday, Tawa hallae is one of the earliest dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived there are 215 million years in New Mexico that faisaita was part of the land of the supercontinent, Pangea and stood toward the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt said that the discovery of the Tawa informs of a new day evolution of the earliest dinosaurs.
Indeed, it provides information on kinship, the distribution and characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt undertook excavations in the company of other paleontologists on Gohst Ranch North of the New Mexico site.
Randall Irmis of the Utah natural history museum and member of the excavation team tells happened them sometimes to find a dozen bones in one day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer of Triassic.
Scientists quickly recognized account that a part of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations have revealed the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories concerning the early evolution of dinosaurs.
Researchers have named it for Tawa according to the word of the Indian Hopi for the God of the Sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it's an exceptional discovery: Dinosaur from the Triassic fossils are extremely rare and are limited to a few incomplete bone fragments.
All paleontology experts do not share that enthusiasm.
For example Martin Sander of the University of Bonn is not that this discovery is particularly spectacular, it stipulates, however, that it allows to confirm some theories about the early evolution of dinosaurs.
After the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils are however fragmented and incomplete which makes it very difficult to the classification of the first dinosaurs.
Experts wonder among others at what time the saurians are divided into three major groups of evolution: (carnivorous) theropod which include Tyrannosaurus and velociraptor emerged later and which descend the quadrupedal sauropods, long-necked birds, and those who they are related and Ornithischian herbivore which belong species such as the triceratops and the Stegosaurus.
According to studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of early theropods.
This species present an interesting report of features both primitive and developed, said S. Nesbitt.
The researchers found clues that suggest that Tawa hallae possessed of the small air sacs in its bones of the skull, like birds who are descended from theropods.
These tiny air pockets facilitate respiration of birds compared to mammals.
It seems that in Tawa hallae, vertebrates have also partially filled with air.
After Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air sacs in its bones.
As the related lineage immense sauropod also possessed air sacs and a light frame, one can think that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive known dinosaurs lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the dinosaur had appeared there - bas.
Therefore, the three main lines of evolution itself are divided and divided from South America to the rest of the world it means all of the land that formed the supercontinent Pangaea.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to him.
Three species cannot descend from a common ancestor that would have migrated, argue the researchers.
Alan Turner of Museum of history natural in New York and co-author of the magazine Science Studies said that there were at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are of course some contradictions.
Martin Sander, paleontologist in Bonn said that there was a still more ancient species, the silesaure, who lived in the current Poland, owned by a group related to the dinosaurs.
According to him this might give a wrong vision because there are a large number of fossils of dinosaurs that have been preserved while there is virtually none on other continents South America.
On the other hand, how dinosaurs are - they managed to become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era while they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the branch of reptiles, is still today a mystery.
At the time of the Triassic period, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, as for example with the ancestors of modern crocodiles and many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic dinosaurs divided on any planet favoring thus the development of many new species so that others, who were related, disappeared between the Triassic and Jurassic.
However, such success is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
It could be a mass extinction which dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles disappeared.
Or then, dinosaurs were more responsive and they were able to eliminate competition on the field.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite favorisal' development of a group of animals which was also developed during the Triassic and that since that time vÃ©gÃ©tait in the shadows: they were mammals.
The solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo.
The list is long and there are signatories from around the world.
There are those of professors of the University of Toronto, Cambridge University, the University of Vienna or Berkeley, California.
There are those of lecturers of the University of Naples, QuÃ©bec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The evacuation by the police of the casino of the J.W. Goethe University in Frankfurt made waves on the entire planet.
278 teachers and teachers of J.W. Goethe University and other higher education institutions of Germany, Europe and North America, and South express their solidarity with the protesting students from Campus Westend.
In a declaration drafted in German and English condemning the police action claimed by the Steering Committee of the University.
Last week, the President of the University Werner MÃ¼ller - Estler had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers in greveapres walls and works of art have daubed graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories believe that damage did not justify "intervention also violent on the part of the commando of police against the students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
The disposal represents an "unacceptable infringement" to freedom of research and teaching.
Due to focus exclusively on vandalism only serves to "delegitimise and criminalise the protest" and tries to forget the reasons of mobilization.
The Steering Committee of the University thus subtracted from the debates that would still be needed.
Loads of course require that criminal proceedings be immediately suspended.
The majority of the occupants took no part in the degradation.
Legitimation of the protests.
Young people in the Union Verdi of the services sector and the Confederation of German trade unions (DGB) show solidarity with students.
The protests are only the legitimate expression of a growing concern for our own future, said Alexander Klein, regional Secretary of the youth of the Verdi Union.
As the Minister of science of the Land of Hessen Eva KÃ¼hne - HÃ¶rmann (CDU), she took cause for the action taken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of places is totally unacceptable, she told the regional Parliament in Wiesbaden last Thursday when the TV show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, expressed the CDU of the regional Parliament Deputy Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of the opposition SPD, the Greens and the left (die Linke) did not share this opinion.
The CSU takes the guise of a few walls peinturlurÃ©s to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler party the left (Linke).
Rather than reflect on the arguments and claims of students, it evacuates them.
The left party tabled a motion which amount the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions for the intervention of the police.
The new ' Silicon - valley ".
For a long time she had the reputation of secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a search for secret weapons, under strict surveillance.
Today with its 216 000 inhabitants at 37 km from the center of Moscow, the commune has the reputation d ' be the ' Silicon Valley 'Soviet.
Important places of production and research in micro - and nanoelectronics are implanted.
As of September 2008 the representatives of Zelenograd have created links with Riedberg, instead of Frankfurt science - with the academic institutes and companies from the centre of innovations of Frankfurt (FIZ).
There is a reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg have ratified a "d"closely"Protocol.
The signatories were the vice - mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz head of section project for Frankfurt.
In 2010 the FIZ and SMEs, representatives whose strong point is scientific research, will start at Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange.
It is a sustainable scientific exchange.
As well as economic relations.
It will allow the FIZ companies to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
Unlike the Russian scientific companies seeking contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is institutes and famous Soviet research companies.
There is the Institut de l 'electrical engineering Moscow, large firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja - Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as 'Socialist City planned' for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literal translation 'Green city') takes its name from the forested hills at the heart of which research centres are located.
The S21 project: a brake for Stuttgart.
One cannot place high enough the extent of the Stuttgart 21 project.
For supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
If we want to. S21, is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a project colossal construction that will immerse the heart of the capital of Baden - WÃ¼rttemberg, in a hopeless chaos of sites for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 is born of the spirit of the 1980s.
Stations head of line, with tracks that ended in the city, had a reputation at the time to be the relics of the technique of 19th century transportation that were effect of stopper of modern rail traffic because it once had much time to switch locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, start - that is to do.
That is why the head end stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And Stuttgart also: a passage of trains station, located at mi - path about the trans-European Magistrale of the rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava where the "heart of Europe" slogan.
S21 project will really start, although visions of the 1980s are no longer long compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost to bury the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
Truthfully, stations head pose more genuine problems of entry and output since there are modern, reversible trains with railcars and car - driver at both ends.
However it is now the realization of Stuttgart 21 next to the new alignment of the inter - city towards Ulm line.
Regional and municipal policies have prevailed.
The railway company is part, because it is the taxpayer making the costs of the risks of the largest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic and not the public undertaking.
From the urban point of view this project can be relatively well justify.
It gets an urban space which - according to the planners, computer - generated graphics will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
Station passage and l 'enlargement of the section are designed for people trafficking to which attributed - and this is typical of the 1980s - an enormous growth.
L ' time there was still competition from cheap flights. "
Modern traffic policy should first focus on the strengthening of the freight traffic because rail transport is much kinder to the environment than by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious concerns indirectly well other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the project of Swabia.
This is the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion is more realistic.
One thing is for sure, in the next decade money fail for other points of junction and congestion in the network.
The list of the Ministry of transport mentioned in all 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the 'enlargement of the section through the Valley of the Rhine of 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987 this line is built at idle.
It would be really urgent support here for background on the fungus.
But the project S21 has the effect of a brake shoe.
The route of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck of international goods traffic in the heart of Europe.
The Government is considering the judgment concerning the airport.
The regional Parliament in Wiesbaden, the Land Government raised the possibility of appealing to the judgment of the Administrative Court of Hessen concerning the prohibition of night flights.
Dieter Posch (FDP) economy Minister announced that the coalition CDU / FDP had commissioned experts to examine from the legal point of view the judgment rendered by the administrative and court which is a document consisting of more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Court had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the rules concerning the prohibition of night flights in the case or the proposed construction of the North landing trail - West of Frankfurt airport would be carried out.
Permission to land for 17 aircraft between 23 h and 5 h in the morning, as is envisaged by the Government of the Land, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against any night air disturbance.
The coalition must have decided for January 4 if it wishes to make an appeal in cassation against the judgment.
The opposition criticizes this time and tries to put pressure on the representative of the Government for one - cirenonce to appeal to the administrative Federal Court in Leipzig.
The head of the parliamentary group SPD Torsten SchÃ¤fer - Gumbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections and which was to ban night flights. Otherwise, it will be condidere as a total failure to a given word.
It's damn hard to be allowed to keep his word, said the leader of the Green Group Tarek Al - Wazir by alluding to the slogan electoral of the FDP, "We are keeping our promises".
The Minister Dieter Posch refutes the reproaches of Schafer - Gumbel who claims that the Land Government trying to still allow night flights using "avocasserie and his".
It takes time to perform a precise legal review.
The coalition does not want to take a decision on the basis of a "first quick impression".
It is necessary that the decision is legally reliable, says Stefan MÃ¼ller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition concerning the declarations of its fraction on the prohibition of night flights is completely wrong.
US banks reimburse allocated aid.
Large US banks, very affected by the crisis, are breaking down their links to the State.
Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had repaid in full to the Treasury 45 billion dollars (more than 30 billion Euros), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
American TV CNBC has indicated in a report that Citigroup was also planning to repay the aid received.
Banking institutions seek to get rid of the restrictions accompanying the acceptance of money, as for example the limitation of allocated bonuses to the leader as well as higher fees.
Bank of America has launched a capital increase through the sale of securities to investors that brought him 19 billion of fresh money.
The rest of the money comes from the Bank funds which are filled through the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday, Kenneth Lewis of Bank of America CEO held expressly to thank the American taxpayers: the injection of capital has greatly helped overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had assumed its capabilities by acquiring the Investment Bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup is also considering to get money on the financial markets in order to free himself from the tutelage of the State.
The U.S. Bank could launch as early as Thursday an increase in capital of $ 20 billion, reported channel CNBC citing banking circles.
-Spokesperson for Citigroup did not wish to comment on this information.
In June banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds which they had benefited.
Accelerated election.
Finally everything still went faster than expected.
Barely two weeks after the dismissal of the current holding of the position of editor in Chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German channel ZDF, the successor is already named.
The commission wanted to vote yesterday evening to make the appointment.
Peter Frey who heads the Berlin drafting of ZDF was the big favourite.
However the chain did not want - officially - confirm the vote to not anticipate the procedure.
However, it seems that there was also the will not further harm to the intendant of the ZDF Markus SchÃ¤chter in the event that the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is the candidate of Schachter, needed the vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the conclusion of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schachter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend for five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender, but this had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council were declared to be favourable to the continuation of Brender and 7 others had voted against. The removal by vote of Brender represented a failure although predictable for Schachter.
Indeed, the CDU which is majority on the Board had already left hear several weeks before the vote, not wanting to renew Brender to his position.
This is Roland Koch, Minister - President of the Land of Hessen which had organized a League against the editor in Chief.
He had refused the contract of esteemed editor be extended, arguing that listening to information of the ZDF emission rate dropped under Brender.
This is the reason why protests were still taking place, almost up to the vote, lambasting the growing political influence exerted on ZDF.
At the end there was even 35 experts in public law who had interfered in the debate and who felt that way of acting of Koch was unconstitutional.
But this will be used for nothing.
Peter Frey: is - it?
Peter Frey was born August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied science - policy, pedagogy etles Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the SÃ¼dwestfunk (body radio of Rhineland - Palatinate) and in the Frankfurter Rundschau (German national newspaper).
In 1983 he became editor of the ZDF first to the news magazine "heute - journal" (journal of today ' hui).
Then his career continues: from 1988 to 1990 he was Deputy Editor - in - Chief of the time; then Washington correspondent in 1991 / 1992, then and until 1998 he was chef and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (bi-monthly information presented the morning program); until 2001 he was head of the Department of foreign policy of ZDF and the Berlin-based editor.
After the disgrace of Brender, while one - ci came just to be elected journalist of the year by the magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens have announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
The opponent of Koch in the Board of Directors, the Minister - President of Rhineland - Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the LÃ¤nder should transform the intergovernmental Treaty of ZDF so that staff of the intendant proposals may not be blocked by a biased political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of the personalities policy members of the ZDF supervisory commissions.
Peter Frey, successor likely Brender had skillfully maneuvered to the Board of directors by criticizing the commission vehemently in his decision to sack Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, SchÃ¤chter was able to propose for the post of editor - in - Chief without losing face, than even the Board of directors could elect him without on the suspect's place as a political supporter.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified liberal left.
Large cleaning in academic studies.
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of education and Cultural Affairs of the LÃ¤nder decide to take a more conciliatory: during a meeting between the Ministers and delegates of the conference of Rectors, an agreement has been developed stating that the conditions of work of Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to come to grips with their studies.
They put agree especially for lightening the burden of examinations: a single review should terminate the study module chosen.
In addition, the workload should be reconsidee to ensure "acceptable and realistic proportions".
The political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The LÃ¤nder also pledged to organize more flexible common structural requirements for Bachelor and Master streams.
At the regional level, there must not be one Land to the other different regulators.
Less examinations.
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Minister of education of the LÃ¤nder and the rectors of universities have constantly to mouth expression fashionable: "etudiabilite".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Council decided to significantly reduce the number of certain reviews: "each module should normally be concluded by a single review", can - one read in a document of about thirty pages on the future conditions for admission to the undergraduate.
Reinhold Grimm, President of the Accreditation Council declares that significantly reducing the burden of examinations should be stop slippage, which interfered greatly with the etudiabilite.
L ' "etudiabilite" should be the litmus test for the Organization of studies in the future.
The modules everything as the bottom must be examined carefully to see if you can not avoid that feeling of suffocation that you sometimes feel in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - according to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition considers that the Defence Minister Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and the necessary margin for manoeuvre to allow and encourage personal initiative".
The new rules affect access to new academic cycles but will also be tailored to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "re-certified" every 5 years, however, which means that it is that by 2015 all the cycles will have been examined.
There are 10 accreditation agencies competent on the whole of the federal territory that depend on the Council created by the LÃ¤nder.
In October, the Ministers of education had exercised pressure on the LÃ¤nder so they weigh on the agencies so that programs are not too loaded and the system of exams not too strict.
In some LÃ¤nder, universities and specialized colleges have already agreed with their regional departments to take appropriate measures.
The Rhineland - Palatinate is so far the only Land have agreed to grant more resources to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities should organize tutorials programmes and strengthen the offices of academic advising as well as examination offices and the Department of international relations.
The LÃ¤nder and universities provide for it a budget of 10 million euros.
In early 2010, the Government wishes to table in Parliament an amendment to the law on higher education institutions.
Following this you will more pull than a single review to conclude his studies.
The Organization of studies will have to be more flexible, more should be able to guarantee the recognition of transcripts of other institutions of higher education and access to the Master needs to be simplified.
By the end of next year, l "etudiabilite" of all undergraduate will have to be considered.
Last Thursday, the Government and the opposition again discussed the question of the conditions of education in the country.
The decisions were appreciated but critics were heard.
The federal President of the union of Socialist students indicated that he wished the Organization of educational policy happening more in the future "behind closed doors" Ministers and rectors of universities.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as subjects should be able to speak a little.
Future graduates of higher education we received support from the President of the conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel delegates: "the student experience is very useful" she said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of education of the LÃ¤nder with which the HRK is working on a joint project of reform.
For education and Science (GEW) Union decisions made in Bonn do not go far enough. It claims the right and the opportunity for each Bachelor degree to enroll in a Master degree.
Andreas Keller member of the Steering Committee of the GEW also asked that the LÃ¤nder provide students Bachelor of today, there tomorrow enough seats for Master studies and the conditions of studies as good as possible.
The LÃ¤nder may need to hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of education have not raised the possibility of easing access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta MÃ¼ller.
It is with these words ' arrival in Germany and it's beautiful, almost out of control... "that begins a work of poet Werner SÃ¶llner, in which he deals in bits of troubling phrases, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who won freedom but at the same time lost its linguistic territory.
Werner SÃ¶llner, born in 1951 in Banat in Romania, was first Professor of German and English in Bucharest and, subsequently, Director of collection in a maison d 'Ã©dition the youth before settling in Frankfurt am Main.
SÃ¶llner has received various literary awards; in 1993 it was coveted Chair of the poetry of Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he is Director of the forum of literature from Hesse to the home of artist Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
It has been much talk him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a Conference in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania" in the mirror and the mirror distorting your Securitate files.
Visibly destabilized and embarrassed, SÃ¶llner made a statement in which he acknowledged his writers colleagues German - Romanian as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had worked as an informant for the Securitate political police.
SÃ¶llner was awarded in 1989 by the German language together with some of the participants.
Tests of recruitment had begun insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes SÃ¶llner so "someone who has not sufficiently able to withstand the tests of intimidation of the Securitate".
Poet Werner SÃ¶llner is the Walter (IM Walter) informant.
Almost simultaneously with honoring i.e. the botanist for Herta MÃ¼ller and his exemplary literary skirmishes with the mechanisms of power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of the originating German authors of Romania, by a case that clearly shows the chasm and the baseness of a system policy, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner SÃ¶llner is, as far as we can say based on current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In its own folder Securitate, IM Walter played a role, provides specialist Michael Markel literature after the confession of SÃ¶llner and it refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favour.
"He had been able to pull him from all difficult situations to l"epoque", according to Markel."
Markel has felt the need moralde make this comment.
The form in which SÃ¶llner made his statement and this audience was unexpected, however the confession of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret service is in fact, not so surprising.
The Germany is a nice reserve for spies of the Securitate had already written Herta MÃ¼ller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages in its own folder.
It can be assumed that the victims have made the speculations and will sometimes guessed what real names were hiding last aliases Sorin, Voicu, and Walter.
In contrast to the Germany where Meanwhile the consultation of the files of the Stasi is a reliable process, attitude vis Ã  vis to the files of the Securitate's legacy is still very confusing.
A systematic clarification was constantly frustrated and slowed down in the past.
Is that in 1999 that a national Council corresponding to the Birthler institution has been created to work on the assimilation of the archives of the Securitate (CNSAS) but rather dragged on the return of the records since.
Since 2005, there is a law that defines the management of the archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very large, is confirmed by an interview with a former head of the Securitate of Temeswar, which, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta MÃ¼ller, expressed very dismissive way against the winner.
She had a psychosis, and ultimately it does had interviewed it only once.
The infamy of power was thought to speak here, without hindrance, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Certainly well questions inevitable are associated if SÃ¶llner as happens so often in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Which has been despoiled? The weighted reaction of listeners, to the admission of SÃ¶llner, suggest that the rest of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta MÃ¼ller, who yesterday received the Nobel Prize, it is more than a footnote.
Tumult in the Champions League.
We had the impression that a representative arrived there, pulled to the nines coming straight from a Christmas party fun, on which sporting goods manufacturer had spread his wares when new coach Christian Gross VFB went up at midnight less one-quarter in a Mercedes class C, that he was just calling, a vendor handmade orange plastic bag.
Man, whose bald head drew attention, was driving in the city which was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our fifties could take him - even the steering wheel - he did not drink alcohol, and he was not drunk nor happiness.
He spent a pleasant evening but tomorrow should return to work.
Because it is now that it was going to start.
The words of the Switzerland that had been to hire three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth finals", that is to say in the League champions with our 3: 1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania "but we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight to not fall".
The "big job" lies ahead Sunday.
There, it's Mainz to repeat the results of League champions on a daily basis.
And it will overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three outgoing goals of Marica (5), TrÃ¤sch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Draw.
The eighth-finals of the Champions League (first leg 16 / 17 + 23 / 24 February / return game 9 / 10 + 16 / 17 March) will be randomly drawn on 18. December in Nyon.
The joy of fulminant entries of the successor of Babbel was moderate.
And the joy was only moderate at the one who had brought luck, which had transmitted to professionals of destabilized Stuttgart, unfailing motivation and fun to play.
I was see the players and I told them that they should focus on their strengths, I advised them d ' be more courageous, explained the "Plumbers of souls"- Gross - the recipe for success that sounded so bienmais who did more effects with the healer Babbel.
It triggered a certain magic, admitted Jens Lehmann - supporter of Babbel-, "in football when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things you never thought possible".
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of break for injury, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the 'phenomenon' found by a proverbial 'fresh wind' and the method of work of the new leader: "is someone who goes to the action and requires discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation "."
But apparently Babbel by had failed.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed Cape Town, warned the manager Horst Heldt.
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs above all tenacity.
Just as Gross, players and the manager will keep overvalue the victory against a defense totally outdated and weakened by the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before there was four days later a bad clock in Leverkusen with 0: 4, objected Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had reached one of the goals of the season but they were others who were still far away.
We have not yet passed the hard cap.
Heldt his 40th birthday does not have the heart to party, even after the first victory at home for three months, is the events of the weekend - a TV interview of goalkeeper Jens Lehmann did bounce back just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others take and no Jens, frustrated Heldt, in response to the harsh critic of Lehmann.
He had accused the weakness of style direction and said that it had decided to change the coach under pressure from pubertal fans.
Lehmann had considered also as a sign of lack of sovereignty and with envy the fact that his day of free after games have been deleted.
Lehmann statements were "marked by a pure selfishness" sank Heldt and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were more likely to become friends for life these two followers.
In any cast, they agreed for the rest, that is to say that without the preliminary work of the group by coach replaced, the sport and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "for the most part in success" replied Heldt and Lehmann in chorus - and even the man with the plastic bag nodded.
World Heavyweight Championship.
Hot fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger provoked constantly verbally and Gesturally Vitali Klitschko world champion.
But after twelve rounds difficult Ukrainian defended his title of world champion of heavy goods vehicles according to the version of the WBC federation.
The judges unanimously it was points.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko retained his World Heavyweight Championship title.
The WBC federation announced that on the night of Saturday the champion of 38 years had won a victory points to the unaminite of judges against American Kevin Johnson (120: 10).
For the third time Klitschko defended his title since her comeback on stage in October 2008 with honour.
Earlier the Ukrainian had already won twice the title of champion of the world by the WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately he failed the long-awaited KO.
Klitschko, made 39 times winner in 41 Professional fights, a of confess by twice its defeat due to injury.
The challenger Johnson has of accept his first defeat in 24 fights.
In the Berne arena, before 17,000 spectators, the big Klitschko especially wanted to dictate the fight, from the top of its 2.02 meters, by his left against.
Johnson, of eleven smaller centimeters before the duel, had announced the end of the "era Klitschko, managed to avoid the champion, preventing thus Klitschko to bring into play its against right dangerous."
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, especially tried to go the rounds.
Although he continued to cause Klitschko in words and gestures his shots reached that very rarely champion.
It is still the second Boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, having above with Klitschko the distance of 12 rounds.
The challenger had made lots of noise in the Switzerland capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko calling "ugly zombie" which "is not really able".
During weighing Friday, the champion could not help cause Johnson in him dropping his sunglasses of the nose "to be able to see his eyes".
Fourth win since Klitschko comeback.
Klitschko has emerged again when his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After a break of nearly four years, he had beaten to l ' time Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" belt WBC had it of previously giving up without a fight. "
This year, defending his title, he won against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
"I just took a shot in this fight and am in perfect shape" told Klitschko to explain his rapid return to the ring.
His dream is to try to gather in the family the four major titles.
His brother Wladimir is champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Hague who, having dethroned grand Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, is the WBA belt.
This summer, Hague had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko, scheduled to take place in September.
It would seem that his promotion company plans to now play the match at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz affair.
Frontal attack of the opposition: the head of the parliamentary group of the Greens, JÃ¼rgen Trittin, accused Defense Minister Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz affair.
Parties SPD and the left (die Linke) asked the Chancellor's explanations.
Hamburg / Berlin - after reviewing the latest information on the Kunduz air strike, the opposition criticised the Defence Minister Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) to have deliberementdissimule some facts.
The Minister has intentionally "formulated an untruth" on the lethal strike of two trucks - tanks in September, said the head of the parliamentary group of the Greens, JÃ¼rgen Trittin, Saturday during the broadcast of the ARD "Tagesschau" (the newspaper of 20: 00) string information.
Clearly, this means that he has lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Force of security in Afghanistan (ISAF) assistance.
It is, in substance, the content of the report available to NATO and which was read by Mr. Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new revelations by the media, the purpose of lafrappe was in fact, not to destroy the stolen trucks, but was good to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured during the American air attack that was launched at the request of Colonel German Goerg Klein, Kunduz military commander.
The Greens, the SPD and the left have requested Saturday Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to decide in the shortest time in federal Parliament and reveal that Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
JÃ¼rgen Trittin and his colleague from the party of the Greens Renate KÃ¼nast are of the opinion that Mrs Angela Merkel must state clearly whether the strategy of targeted massacre is part of the Afghan Government increase policy if the Chancery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
-Spokesperson for the Government categorically rejects these criticisms.
The Chancery has influenced any interventions by the army in Afghanistan, he said.
Saturday, voices were increasingly strong to express doutesquant to reasons genuine of the dismissal of the inspector general Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as it had been submitted by the Department.
According to the information of the newspaper SPIEGEL, the information that they had handed over to Guttenberg about the attack on the trucks - tanks were both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the report of NATO and hidden to the Minister some bothersome details.
In the surroundings of the two senior officials it is suggested however that they have informed the Ministry of defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein as well as a report of the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert would be asked Meanwhile in a letter clarification of the facts.
So far, it has not received response.
Saturday, the Department did not wish to comment on these accusations and referred to the Committee of inquiry of the federal Parliament that was going to be the next Wednesday to bring light on the facts in question.
The worlds of dream.
Some see, while awake, images and hear voices that nobody else sees or hears.
It has not only among the mentally ill or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality merge.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything goes fine.
When we are lying in darkened rooms, we can engage us unfettered dreams and wildest fantasies.
However those who awakened, experienced d "dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has a reputation in our Western world d" be insane or drugged, or at least "be an original.
Such images and voice do not appear among the mentally ill or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imaginations which is at issue: it's the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint pictures or writing novels, but that sometimes prompts the boundaries between dreams, madness and reality blend.
A State of conscious awareness, taking the form of a dream, can occur in forms the most various, in the best of cases it is called visions, during the worst of the madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect can be distinguished, the visions of the Mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the experiences of drug of the Prophet of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, the seconds States of shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when l ' balance, substances neurotransmitter of the brain - first and foremost the dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and the achetylcholine - breaks and that the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed. "
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts very often occur during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The force of gravity has more power over the person.
Since antiquity, philosophers and physicians always looked at the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, the hallucinations were a form of dream - awakened; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 'a great resemblance between madness and the dream', for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all irregularities, fantasies, delusions and sensory illusions that composes".
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into a cartoon character.
His body is in two dimensions with Garish colors.
Gravity no longer has power over him, it hangs to the reset of the ceiling.
He feels a shot.
Behind him the winged Devil creatures grimacing mouth bloodied, showing teeth.
They continue it, give him of kicking with heavy boots flamboyant, throw against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body.
Voices thundering, nasty, howl, coming out of the walls and the radio.
It can no longer support these voices which insult it and humiliate him.
Henning T. snatches two cables from the stereo, in fact a loop and attaches it to a hook fixed to the ceiling.
It rises on a baffle and happens the loop around your neck.
He jumps.
The loop stands.
That serve you lesson, screaming voices in a chorus to him snatch the eardrum. "Going to a clinic and do - you care!".
Today Henning T. 40 years, he lived six acute psychosis, the latest date of 2 years, the first of soon 20 years.
It was triggered by the LSD.
The diagnosis: psychosis schizo - affective, paranoid, moreover it is manic - depressive, he takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During the psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
One per - cent of the population suffers at least once in his life of schizophrenia; in clinical psychiatric it is the most common disease after the depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, the persons concerned can no longer tell the difference between the inner world and the outside world, they find themselves in a State of hyper arousal, which can suffer hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices - voices that command, that comment or that interact.
Optical hallucinations are not rare either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the trivial, the brain can no longer filter disruptive signals, the conscious is drowned in the sensations.
Just like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis focuses on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry at the University Hospital in Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatry im UniversitÃ¤tsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is located in the heart of the situation, at a meaning centred on him.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, as in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is the reason why schizophrenics feel often threatened, controlled, handled.
In general they do not have the possibility of adjusting the reality, illusions are a cruel reality, wake is excluded.
To experience once in a lifetime of a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "sensory and structure space of reality that is seen during the psychosis, is basically preserved."
Thoughts and delusions hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real setting.
Why our brain does - it this kind of antics, is still an Enigma to researchers.
Exceptional situations may bring about everyone to momentarily lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that the persons concerned are tiny brain.
It was assumed that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explained Fuchs.
But what remains still unexplained, is the manner in which the abnormality of the neuronal system occurs and also the fact that it does not occur for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, if however there is a predisposition.
Same hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain heats.
What is crazy, says psychology Professor Erich Kasten of LÃ¼beck, is that psychotic suffer from their hallucinations and expensive medications to dispose while others buy very expensive to obtain drugs.
Pleasant or unpleasant illusions perception is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten brings from ten years of reports on hallucinations and illusory images phenomena: last year it published its findings in a book entitled "The unreal world in our head".
Hallucinations well are part of typical concomitant phenomena of psychosis as well as an impressive number of many other pathologies.
There are among them psychic disorders such as the borderline or depression but also migraine, l "epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head injury.
Surprisingly, that under certain conditions even the brains of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that normally are inhibited.
They form when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions, are hyperactive or not enough refrenees; When our brain but also hot when there is lack of stimulation.
The drug can trigger this State like a brain injury or a psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, the stress, the sorrows of love or other exceptional mental States.
In recent studies, one-third of participants acknowledges having experienced at least once in his life of a hallucination.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. was 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg - Vorpommern, and she goes to high school.
A young girl all to do normal to tell the truth.
If there are no images and voices.
During recess, he arrives as a young boy, slim, with long chestnut hair, addresses it.
When she meets her classmates watching, amazed - no one else sees nor heard this boy.
They think that this shy girl is a whimsical dreamer but Sarah K does not dream, it is certain.
She is awake, hears and sees the boy as she sees and hears the girl who sits next to her on the bench.
It can even perceive its presence temporarily.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this young friendly.
Am - I crazy?, asks t - it sometimes.
But she knows that this young and other visions are not real and they will disappear again.
The night the appearances are, in general, frightening.
Often the visions are cumbersome.
When she is in class, it happens that it cannot follow the course because the Professor is just presenting a new student in his eyes and his ears while he is invisible to others and that the Professor is obviously being explain equations in table.
The night the appearances are, in general, frightening.
When, in the darkness of his room, looked sleep that happens too rarely and too late, it often cannot distinguish if it is awake or dreaming already, if the images she sees, grimacing faces or the girl with bloody gashes on the arms and legs are located before his eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, Cree t - it to these creatures.
It does not mention neither his parents nor his friends, they would take the crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She had her bac last year and lives with his friend.
A year ago the hallucinations have stopped.
Since she came into contact via the internet with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the probability is great having hallucinations after a certain time.
I guess that the brains n 'being not quite busy, so that there is animation.
Sarah K., single girl, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when she learned at age 13, that the man she called Daddy, since he was age thinking, n "was not his real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for the hallucinations Visual and acoustic, and for impressions and sounds real, so it's very difficult for people like Sarah K to distinguish between illusion and reality. "Every experience", according to Kasten "takes place in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, this is why they seem so real "."
Kasten, nocturnal dreams are also a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people does not fundamentally differ from those in acute psychosis.
The reverse of the schizophrenics, mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not actual pictures.
This is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish the hallucinations as a special talent.
There is only a step between dream and hallucination.
In our world too centered on consciousness there is unfortunately quickly tend to take the imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt - Degenhard, Professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of the clinic for Psychiatry and psychotherapy hospital Florence Nightingale in DÃ¼sseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, painful disease but which also contains something positive, creator - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt - Degenhard studied the form of experience oniroide, a particular form of the change of consciousness aroused by the dream.
The oniroides experiences are of semi - very complex dreams which are perceived as real by the one who lives and what it can differentiate the dream even when he is awake.
L ' State of consciousness oniroide manifests during trauma or in situations of extreme as for patients with pathologies of polyradiculopathie that fully aware, experience of motor paralysis. "
According to Schmidt - Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and of the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, it replaces the real situation which has affected his life, by his own imaginary world which is disassociated from reality.
It is a State of mental boundary between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the actual situation is represented in the imagination.
It is in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in a situation in itself intolerable, a capacity of organization that is given to us to us men, for not to sink into nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in memories.
The Peter Cornelius Classen, art historian Zurich also described his oniroides experiences in his book "Change of heart" as action for the safeguarding of the 'soul.
He was 49 years old at the time where his conscious part for a trip of several days after a heart valve followed by a transplant operation; During this time, his body is doomed to remain still in the ICU.
Claussen plunges into a world that he created from scratch, visit foreigners, travel in time. He sees old man reality in a rail sanatorium, a robot at his bedside watching over his health.
He lives in the middle age among noblemen producing blood-based drugs.
He is kidnapped by a Greek on a motorcycle who takes him to his country, he surfed with his hospital bed in the neve of the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
It is absorbed completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen these domestic travel differ fundamentally from any dream.
The dream is a quite different, written - State it in describing what he lived.
Instead of dreams, mental travel memories are of extreme clarity and very detailed same years later.
We can even say that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the actual experience.
The intensity of the experience shattered the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt - Degenhard.
Ultimately, delirium oniroides, psychosis, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how our internal representations of external reality are fragile even in sleep state.
Any change in the State of consciousness, summarized the Kasten psychologist "may cause a distortion of what we call reality".
An experience that can be also quite rewarding.
The first snow may fall.
Burda.
At the age of 27, children will take the rest of the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen to the position of CEO of the Burda publishing is an intermediate solution: longer term Hubert Burda wish that her two children will resume the press group, he said to the newspaper Spiegel.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - A long term, editor Hubert Burda sees his company into the hands of his children.
Two children inherit aged 27 and are firmly determined to integrate society, said Hubert Burda, 69 years, to Spiegel.
All the details have been set in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the business arise later.
Need to see also if they are capable.
It cannot impose its children to 7500 employees without knowing if they have the ability to deal.
That demolish the children as well as the company.
Burda did know last Thursday that it was withdrawing position President - Director - General from January onwards and that his successor was Paul - Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, age 52, is a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was first responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently he became the Treasury sector it is to say that he was responsible for the company's capital and after the departure of JÃ¼rgen Todenhofer he also took the head of marketing, finance, the foreign sector, and printing.
Thus for the first time this is not a member of the family who is the head of the Burda publishing.
Burda children respectively 19 and 17 years, his son Felix who would now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The nomination of Kallen also serves to make the link for the next 10 or 15 years "."
Burda said that the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins were still held in families who themselves are left lead by a compulsive desire for capital, making huge unfortunate speculations that they might climb still higher.
It has never been my strategy.
I've never had a revede universal power, said Burda.
I can't see myself absolutely in the role of tutor to the country as could it be Springer and I did not intend to be part of these international leagues such as the Time, these companies have taken much too much importance.

"No Plan of competitiveness of the automotive sector, we would today have a landscape of abandonment, closing some of our main production sites", said the President of the Government.
"Through this plan and the decision marks stay in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can look to a future of peace for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector", he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Plan for the automotive sector (PIA), spent 800 million euros to 19 manufacturers and 137 ancillary businesses, projects which involved an investment of more than EUR 3 000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended as well to the development of new models as "to the modernization of products and already existing processes.
Zapatero has also put emphasis on governmental support measures at the request, referring to the Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with the autonomous communities and the car companies.
According to the President, this plan reduced 6% average emissions from new vehicles offered for sale on the Spanish market and contributed to a "strong increase" registrations, which rose by "40%" in November.

MAZDA3 i - Stop: A sustainable sporting spirit.
Mazda intends to prove that sportsmanship is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it comes to integrate on the Mazda3 the system stopping and starting the engine, dubbed i - Stop, a device which, at least for now, is available on the 2.0 150 horsepower gasoline engine.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the note she received as a whole.
The details, the finish of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i - Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting from the driving position, it turns out that the front seats are excellent ergonomics and a fixation.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the ensemble formed by the control panel and console, we see how Mazda has continued in the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and commands, as well as bright red and blue colors.
This style reminds us, in part, that of the Honda Civic.
This is why we can say that both the Mazda3 the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and with the Volkswagen Golf, specifically that all want to surpass.
In continuing with the cockpit, this compact Japanese car shows a more than sufficient livability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Added to all this a large chest in regular forms.
The system shutdown and automatic start-up of the engine, at least for now, is available only on the gasoline engine two liters and 150 horsepower and six-speed manual change.
This engine is a real joy. It is illustrated by its delicacy, its low noise, its benefits and the mastery of its consumption.
Indeed, although most requested Mazda3 diesel models, those that do not perform a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i - Stop with petrol engine, both for its comfort of speed for its controlled consumption.
On level d "equipment, the model chosen for the test is the sporty, in other words one that presents the largest number d" elements of series.
Among the standard equipment, the assistant of lane change (RVM) which removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, the speed controller, the photosensitive interior mirror, the Board on a large sized screen computer, parking sensors, independent air-conditioning, the rain and light sensor, bluetooth and audio bluetooth, as well as wheels 17 inch alignmentare particularly notable.
In addition, as if this equipment is not enough, this version had the Premium package which, for over 1,500 euros, includes elements of lighthouses adaptable bi - xenon and a BOSE audio system with dash disc.
Conclusion.
Mazda3 2.0 i - Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is illustrated in particular by the quality materials used, by his behaviour and his level "high equipment.
In addition, those who do not perform many kilometres per year may opt for the i - Stop version only associated the gasoline 2.0 150 horsepower engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which lies between 21 770 euros for the Luxury finishing and 23 270 euros for the tested model, the sporty.
In return for this large sum, the Mazda3 will offer us every day a large dose of satisfaction.
"First" luxury.
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality by PenÃ©lope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars we have more than ever dazzled you, dressed in as elegant models as sexy for the release of Nine. (Photo: Gtresonline).
Our "EP", as sophisticated as veteran, had opted for a dark 'lady'.
The promise of FonPeek.
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to watch his e-mail, without offering the possibility not what would be to see some type of attachments or surf the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of Fame in the States - United, when Time magazine appointed him as one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers very low priced and a monthly subscription, or less than half of what costs, for example, the subscription data to the iPhone.
Given its success, the company has launched two new features: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free service of data to life, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, present yesterday when l 'event the Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is just as limited as its great - American brother, but has a surprise.
The price of monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those travelling with a Smartphone already know what represents the fact renounce data when it crosses a border or desperately seek a cafeteria on the Wifi (or Fon connection) to be able to check his mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive and it is long overdue that it should work.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and options travel, but in relation to me, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand and of good glasses to read the small print.
Reminders to the order repeated of the European Commission to propose affordable roaming throughout Europe had a barely perceptible effect.
Outside of its country of origin, one hesitates to use the data, and it is not wrong.
As a small camera like the FonPeek (it is still curious it is called Fon while it lacks Wifi) offers this type of rates, means that operators are beginning to think differently and are studying different proposals allowing them to monetize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes download of books and other research on the Internet.
Without subscription and galley.
It's a connected device and we pay for his purchase and not every month.
And that is what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: an option to purchase with lifetime access as Peek is already proposing to States - United.
Not that I want to buy it.
Watching my mail on my phone, thank you.
I hope simply because I believe that it is more just for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The favorite color of Michelle.
Yellow is, without doubt, the favorite color of the first lady of the States - United.
If she went to the decision-making function of Barack Obama to the Presidency of the States - United with a dress and a coat of this color, it has, in fact, chosen the same to accompany him in the second time, without a doubt, the most important of his life: delivery to Oslo for the Nobel Prize for peace.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model in both occasions: also their similar color, a yellow pulling green with bright highlights, both times, holding consisted of three parts: the dress, jacket and coat, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So although a first coup d ' eye, it would seem that the first lady States - United follow the wake of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to submit the same outfits. "
But the fabric in which are carved the two sets makes it very different.
Whether for taking office it was a thick lace, on the other hand, she wore a printed velvet in Oslo.
Props are also different: Green shoes medium heel for the first time, and a similar but Golden model, this time - ci.
The hairstyle she also changed: the hair are now relieved she wore them loose last time.
75% of working mothers have had professional problems because of their maternity.
Discrimination in the workplace has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generations who want to be mothers.
It is revealed in l '"Fertility and professional career of women in Spain", study by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, conducted on 9 737 women from 15 to 75 years, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers have seen their careers limited due to motherhood.
L 'study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, if the woman works or not and the types of jobs held.
Those that have no activity outside the home, work part-time or have little steady work, come earlier in couple, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, primarily in the public sector, are pushing entry into life in couple and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Among women aged 35-49 with a fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after s 'be installed in pairs. This figure passes to 4.1 in those who work in the public sector." These data show that women with a stable job have needed more time in their lives to get it, what brought them to repel the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment influence widely motherhood, but less than the starting date of common life ", explains the researcher at the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
Level d ' studies is another factor that widens the gap of l ' age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the level of training is high, more they marry and have their first child later.
The difference also maintains among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group with between 35 and 49 years, those who have made elementary and higher education respectively were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and averaged 32.1 years.
"Another distinctness appears also between women, depending on their level" studies.
While those who have completed elementary studies marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those with average or higher level studies reverse this program and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a prerequisite to marriage and the arrival of a child ", says Ms. Delgado.
Diane Kruger as well worth it.
L ' OrÃ©al Paris has just added a new name to its list envied ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will embody the image of many brand products, singing the universal currency "because I'm worth it".
The protagonist of the Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant of the international stage actresses, comes thus join other celebrities recorded at l ' OrÃ©al Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Penelope Cruz Spanish.
Before her, the last to enter this if select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
Among men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Grey, lessons of Anatomy) and Matthew Fox (the companion of Evangeline in Lost).

It is not according to the predictable and apprehended genres (biographical sketch, life and work), but by seeking something similar to the kernel of ignition of the created character.
The trip is exciting and Vincent n 'spares neither fears nor the illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to the readings and re-readings.
I leave you here a few snapshots.
On Albert Camus: "In its pages, I discovered the Mediterranean n" was not a sea but a spiritual, almost physical impulse-even I felt without naming it: pleasure against the disastrous fate, morality without guilt and innocence without no God. ".
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilistic, Christian allegorical, he wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, as the blade of the knife which failed to kill him.".
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman with a passion which lasted thirteen years, in the flesh which he joined l' emotion of adultery to the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege which was to reach heaven by way of perdition. ".
On James Joyce: "Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the peaks of eight-thousander of universal literature, that climb by the north face, on which the best climbers dropped yet and always taken. "."
On William Faulkner: 'C' was a strange type.
Him - even, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a landowner in the County and other times that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
These two dreams were of magnitude. ".
On Louis - Ferdinand CÃ©line: "this writer picked up the mad cry pushed from a bridge by the character of Munch to carry its echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in its literary form, and he did it in the same leak him - and by invoking the brought with a violent speech at the maggots.".
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt and prayed:" God well - liked, I implore you to do that I stop d "write like a woman.".

On Pio Baroja: "What did MartÃ­n - Santos if it doesn't try to conceal Joyce at Baroja?
That tried Benet if it is to shoot Baroja by Faulkner

A cowardly aggression.
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent beside her and our dog, a blood - mele, saved from the SPA and weighing not more than six kilos, and without saying a Word, they assenÃ¨rent him two kicks that left severely injured dog.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see that there fun to attack free a small animal without defence which, moreover, was on a leash.
It should be added the indignation of a lady who walked quietly and that, when what she injuria these individuals came to fear for his physical integrity, since a madman who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, anyone smaller than him.
L 'episode took place around 17 o'clock, one Tuesday as another, in a usually quiet.
The dog groaned all day.
We of course filed complaint with the office of the district even though we doubt that this be used to large - thing and do not touch the sensibilities, we want to just specify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people so that they are fun to abuse an animal without defence which gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company for free.
We do not know where did the good education and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for the wearing of helmets.
The manufacturer of Michelin tyres, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for road safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the headset port, mainly among younger riders, as reported today the two structures.
This initiative is designed to raise awareness of the importance of the helmet, since it is the only element of protection to "avoid injuries to the head, or even death, accident on two wheels.
Michelin indicated that this campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which "goes to-beyond of the design and manufacture of still safer products" and stated that it was contributing to this objective by other actions in educational and informative character.
This new campaign of encouragement of the helmet on two wheels, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include an initial phase during which posters will be distributed in over 500 garages for motorcycles, in order to ensure the widest possible dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant preoccupation" for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for vehicles with two wheels, one of its main objectives is to develop still more secure products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles is progressing.
After almost two years, the market of light commercial vehicles starts to see a little light at the end of the tunnel.
9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures of the syndicat patronal manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, the dealers.
However, it should be qualified good news, since the reference to the comparison, the month of November 2008, was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% from the previous year.
Accordingly, despite the rebound of the last month, accumulated during these 11 months registrations are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if you add up all vehicles that fall into the category of commercial vehicle light (derived from passenger cars, pick - up, vans, light vans and trucks to light chassis) 95 853 have been sold.
The big clouds that affect most asked are not for all dissipated. Indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized companies, who pay in almost 100% of cases through external funding.
Thus, more restrictions implied by the limitation of bank credits, must be added other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of poor economic conditions.
Faced with this situation and the difference in passenger vehicles, aid for the purchase of the 2000th were little used.
In addition to individuals, the self-employed and SMEs who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level d "of Co2 emissions that exceed 160 grams per kilometre, may also benefit from, but the number of operations speaks of him - even.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, it recalled again the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealers association provides a year 2010 similar to that ends, for which she calculates a drop in sales (tourism and 4 x 4 vehicles) of 19%.
Emergency brake assistance is now mandatory.
As this took place with the anti-lock brake system ABS system and this will take place with the ESP stability control, emergency brake assistance systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on passenger cars and light commercial vehicles newly registered, while for the rest of the vehicles a waiting period has been set until "late February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, has aimed to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, because of its mode of action, it can also help prevent many rear shocks.
Emergency braking assistant works by increasing the pressure on the brakes in an emergency detected by the system through the kick given by the driver.
But does not always maintain pressure until "at the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for cars Bosch, a third of drivers involved in an accident was unable to press the brake before the collision, and half of them had not taken advantage of any strength.
Until "1 100 accidents.
The intervention of the assistance, en revancha, requires maximum brake system, reducing the distance whose car need to stop.
According a study by the EU, if all cars were equipped with this type of "elements, until" 1 100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even greater with the popularization of the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: we calculate that a disaster on four with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, helps it by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors pushed until January the plan for Opel.
While the Opel's Figueruelas (Zaragoza) factory workers have been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April - probably 8-, according to Javier Ortega, the North - American manufacturer warned it will need of more time to conclude the emergency plan of Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, means that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may involve that the final document, which will be first submitted to workers and then to the Governments of the countries where factories, be postponed until "in early 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, we ensure that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
